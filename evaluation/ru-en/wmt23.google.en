The July issue is traditionally submitted during the Moscow Film Festival, and this is, of course, very sad: to proofread the pages when your soul is yearning for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will talk about the Moscow International Film Festival next time (for now I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely offensive principle that not a single normal film festival in the world is guilty of, has finally taken hold in the minds of the organizers), and in this issue we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The July issue features another pleasant face on the cover - the title character from the Robert Rodriguez-produced Predators, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan&#39;s Inception (the man who rebooted Batman, by the way), the most - no kidding - anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is certainly no need to advertise anything special, and it is clear as day that the author of Suspicion and Rope is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlyn, Dan Jolin, Tamara Donduray, Nikolay Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pearce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina London CIA agent Evelyn Salt, despite brilliant track record, they suspected him of spying for the Russians and decided to catch him at any cost.
Driven into a corner, she will dye her hair the black we are accustomed to and set out to seek the truth herself.
The next action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal fighter promises to further strengthen the actress&#39;s position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run along the walls a la &quot;The Matrix&quot; and throw strong men in identical formal suits around like children.
This is roughly how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear one, who blew up and fixed the world with the “Fifth Element” and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out not to be a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but a lovely living carnival.
I don’t want to remember what Besson did during the 13 years between “Element...” and “Adele...”
He, to put it mildly, was not idle, but all this script-producing fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
But &quot;Adele...&quot; - hardly.
When you watch this film, it seems that 13 years ago it was not our Besson who stood before us, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a café across the street and made up a story about a charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
The incredible thrill here is that there are surprises waiting for you around every turn or remark.
And all of them are pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most daring adventure film of the decade hints that The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele will begin like Amelie, veer towards Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi&#39;s comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adele.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging him to appreciate the special effects, scenery or tricks, but draws him along, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the earth: “Forward, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched too many old films and read too much Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying oneself cynicism and not being embarrassed by risks
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
STARRING: Louise Bourgouzn, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lelouch
PLOT: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster, which was brought to life by an old medium.
The fossil is being chased by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has business not so much with the beast itself, but with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMING OUT JULY 22
“Adele...” is a case where a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it along a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone&#39;s spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino&#39;s gangster action films, the aforementioned &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; (he was both bowed to and ridiculed here), and finally, with the same &quot;Fifth Element&quot;.
Besson&#39;s style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and strong as never before).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by pure courage and bravery.
In the movies, such girls are usually assigned some kind of macho or doe-eyed romantic guy on duty.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who just gets underfoot (only his knowledge of zoology turns out to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre &quot;cats&quot; and seemingly completely sour, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative daring, reminding us that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and high-brow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing adventure movies without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
A hermetic horror with a claim to psychological insight and political context. In 2002, Jonathan Liebesman&#39;s debut horror film was panned by critics, but was liked by the public and earned well at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
Thus, the young director found himself in a factory forging new horrors using old templates: Bay set himself the goal of remaking all the classics of horror and entrusted Liebesman with a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The critics again grimaced, but the public again liked it - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the &quot;new horrors&quot;, which emphasize the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In general, his example shows how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways of influencing a jaded public: the naturalistic bloodshed of splatters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali&#39;s debut film &quot;Cube&quot;. The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So in “The Death Room,” Liebesman was forced to take a different path: instead of a dull massacre or a monotonous run from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological play and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with their experimental subjects.
And three men in a locked room try to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are tested, but also a young ambitious intelligence officer, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is skilled in wild experiments.
PLOT: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a stack of papers with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, with government agents watching closely from behind glass.
Too thoughtful to be a horror film, but not enough to be an outright arthouse.
He can make small talk and hit someone in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can’t miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father&#39;s courtly lifestyle and openly watches him as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven&#39;s Showgirls, dives into the pool for his next romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession, which, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl’s unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything can be bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchyan, together with Pavel Bardin, filmed a languid melodramatic comedy with Ivan Urgant, “Three and a Snowflake.”
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre
The fragmented plot meanders around the love affairs of the characters, who are constantly talking about psychology, while they themselves, apparently due to the director’s witty invention, focus on the language of glances and gestures.
The secondary plot lines (the girl crippled in a car accident whom Alexei wants to marry, the alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are only sketched out in dotted lines.
It&#39;s especially sad that the line about the business of buying up football players remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything else, an agent selling football stars is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she absolutely must marry a guy with a “backbone.”
Imagine the businessman’s disappointment when Nastya, in the fight for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But the author hit the nail on the head with the potential slogan for the film&#39;s audience: &quot;Don&#39;t look for a problem where there isn&#39;t one.&quot; You couldn&#39;t have said it more accurately.
Their similarities are simply striking.
In both films there are squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump around almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both cases something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the scenery.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive suits, are hard to tell apart (they&#39;re both played by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana&#39;s previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White previously made a film about dance battles - &quot;Brotherhood of Dance&quot;.
Chris Evans was recently approached to play a different comic book character: Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by the comic book series that ran in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, while Joe Carnahan was inspired by the 80s sitcom.
It&#39;s simply amazing how, without collusion, they brought different material to an absolutely identical thundering denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films that bring to mind a lot of films with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then “Losers” looks a little nicer and is clearly poorer in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there&#39;s Zoe Saldana here, who looks great in a bazooka.
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA are set up by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are considered dead from that moment.
But they are alive - and they intend at all costs to take revenge on the villain with the languid voice who set all this up.
It&#39;s all nice, but honestly, it&#39;s only worth spending an hour and a half of your life on White&#39;s painting if you have absolutely no better options.
A recycled, conditionally edible action movie
A simple story about an escaped Romanian convict
A low-budget Romanian film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only this data on hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be socially acute.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability that non-professional actors will participate.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were given a lecture on Bresson in the early 80s.
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is particularly in demand among directors of the Romanian New Wave.
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
Everything said above is also true for Florin Serban&#39;s debut work, and - please understand us - it is not at all abusive, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian &quot;new wave&quot; is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods
her work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this faith can one endure the hour and a half spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the gulf separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert into a 70s-style exploitation, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from the prison he&#39;s about to be released from to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: Gheorghe Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: After serving his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but suddenly discovers that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man&#39;s behavior becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense this all is!
If you want to watch, watch.
A decent debut that gives a faint hope that Romanian arthouse will one day grow into a decent genre.
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-writer Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey eminence of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
&quot;Despicable Me&quot; is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in ZO, especially if you like when different objects every now and then try to jump out of the screen into the audience), it is tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single below-the-belt joke, because of which in &quot;Ice Ages&quot; you had to shyly press yourself into your chair and cover your children&#39;s ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors&#39; sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The “adult” part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is provided by a rather harsh black humor (for which, I would like to think, we owe director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it even turns out to be too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every detail so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
It&#39;s not that we want to see children&#39;s cartoon characters eaten by cannibals or destroyed by a nuclear explosion.
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the Moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to carry out his great plan and eliminate his young competitor.
In a certain advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, whose killer cuteness is comparable only to the cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is based on Christopher Meledandri - both are bald, have big noses and are prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta&#39;s part.
A car pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a supposed desert, and three pairs of the most beautiful tits emerge from it.
That&#39;s right.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we have good news right away: the entire film is maintained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about female beauty and casted in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
The &quot;broker&quot;, &quot;killer&quot; and &quot;stripper&quot; are digging in the sand, pouring water over themselves (don&#39;t ask why), talking nonsense and periodically fighting quite ferociously.
The creators think that a cursing chick with generous curves, covered in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
&quot;Bitchy Stuff&quot; is primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
A similar film in Moscow distribution is “A Gun for Jennifer.”
It&#39;s also cool when a bitchy babe twists a bandit&#39;s balls, a crazy punk fights with a Japanese schoolgirl, and there&#39;s a samurai sword and lesbian sex, and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
All in all, for a film fetishist there is a real Klondike of pleasures here.
It&#39;s understandable, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun filming this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren&#39;t for the actresses&#39; physical characteristics, it would have become boring by the middle.
One might assume that this nonsense came to us from the adult late-night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial amount hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to squabble, fight with each other and with the thugs who periodically arrive from somewhere, and also regularly kiss and cuddle.
As things progress, it turns out that all three are not who they initially claimed to be.
Apparently, in the author&#39;s opinion, it&#39;s even funnier this way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film, &quot;Doomsday,&quot; a watered-down &quot;Mad Max&quot; for the have-nots, Marshall made a serious misfire.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director&#39;s shaken trust.
The new politically incorrect and grim magnum opus doesn&#39;t shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-movie aesthetics.
The film contains both the hooligan courage of “Dog Soldiers” and the animal cruelty of “The Descent”.
The &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; to cleanse the &quot;peplum&quot; of the post-gladiator film filth, on the whole, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (including the unexpectedly colourful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and the piquant details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from Sir Ridley Scott&#39;s now standard Gladiator, but for some reason there is absolutely no desire to try to catch Marshall in plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost where Centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) serves is mercilessly destroyed by a Pictish reconnaissance company.
Miraculously saved, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Itane (Kurilenko).
The subtle arthouse actor has so far only managed to win back-up roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after Centurion the situation will change.
Peplum - revised and supplemented edition.
Almost like Gladiator, only more modest and severe
A continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two extremely promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson&#39;s fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy sorcerer who is called upon to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The Lord of Fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can only stop him if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has the ability to steal other people&#39;s thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the object&#39;s dream, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head something that was not there.
A pictorial lesson in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
A seasoned wizard (Nicolas Cage) recruits a young assistant in the hopes that the two of them can defeat an evil mage (Alfred Molina).
Using destructive spells, they will create a bedlam of dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
A kitty as bald as a billiard ball has plotted to take over the world, and now the dog super-agents are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second episode of the fluffy family comedy.
Several hardened thugs, led by the frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted for sport by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of the iconic 80s character to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teams up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn (Control) for a deeply curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding out in a small Italian town and belatedly learning about human nature.
&quot;A visionary artist of Corbijn&#39;s caliber and the magnificent George Clooney are a filmmaking match made in heaven,&quot; boasts a studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney&#39;s life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth&#39;s novel A Very Private Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American in the title, and the main character was transformed from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to sort out his last case and finally quit his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Ruthen), with whom Clooney&#39;s character instantly falls in love.
&quot;Jack tempts fate,&quot; reads the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who she claims to be.&quot;
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn&#39;s visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney&#39;s ash-blond hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe to star in adaptation of Remarque&#39;s &#39;All Quiet on the Western Front&#39;
Can I take a picture of you with a camera gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller The Tourist by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Lives of Others).
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie&#39;s character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the set of The Rum Diary, a film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Withnail &amp; I), whose last directorial work was the 1992 thriller Jennifer 8.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can have no doubt about what inspired them.
But you can’t approach the issue of implementing an idea literally!
However, at least it’s good that the heroine of the Russian film, although alien, is not at all bald.
Director Dennis Dugan primarily specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already collaborated on four projects: Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding, and Don&#39;t Mess with Gohan!
The fifth comedy, “Classmates,” will be released in July, and the sixth, “The Pretender Wife,” starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by viewers this year for the spectacular action movie Kick-Ass, will be rebooting the X-Men.
In the film X-Men: First Class, the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While filming of the new Bond film is being delayed, its new director Sam Mendes is not having time to get bored.
His to-do list includes the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the film adaptation of Isan McKewson&#39;s novel On the Beach.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering playing the hard-nosed Major George Smiley, the protagonist of John Le Caret&#39;s series of novels, in the film adaptation of the thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
The first adaptation of this work in 1979 starred Alec Guinness.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let the Right One In.
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell&#39;s best-selling science fiction novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not an easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but it is an extremely interesting job.
He has already made offers to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action movie by Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title “Soldiers of Fortune” is taking place in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war with their own money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film&#39;s premiere is scheduled for early 2011.

Megan Fox Fired From Transformers 3
According to the film company Pagatoine, the dismissal &quot;is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.&quot;
However, the place of the main character and the new lover of Shia LaBeouf&#39;s hero will most likely be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take crash courses in acting.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Cloverfield), Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted), Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (L.A. Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist) and Miss USA 1986 First Vice Halle Berry (Monster&#39;s Ball) started out as models or modeled for fashion magazines and eventually won a well-deserved Oscar.
They also excelled in acting (beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
They clearly have high awards within arm&#39;s reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes Jury in 2008 for her film Everyone Dies But Me and directed the scandalous TV series School, received the position of creative director at the MT TV channel.
The channel&#39;s management believes that Valeria will be the one to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to film their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also began casting new presenters.
The comedy &quot;Kolotilov&quot; by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into &quot;Vykrutasy&quot;.
The main theme of the film remains the same: provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) is in a hurry to Moscow to see his fiancée, but is delayed to train a soccer team of street kids.
The second plot line of the film received new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital&#39;s bride Nadya will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear - Nadya&#39;s ex-fiancé Dania (Ivan Urgant).
So, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a ton of side projects, Guillermo del Toro stepped down from his position as director.
The studios are urging producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he is only willing to do so if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
The new director&#39;s name will be officially announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie to Play Cleopatra
Crazed by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at high speed between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where a stream of press conferences and round tables were held, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved in a similar manner - in almost all of them, someone was running away somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov&#39;s &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; and Dmitry Mamuliya&#39;s &quot;Another Sky&quot; were looking for their missing grandson and wife, and the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov&#39;s &quot;Zhit&#39;&quot;
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of Klim Shipenko&#39;s detective film &quot;Who Am I?&quot; - who, however, was remembered by the public rather for the presence of a totally naked Zhanna Friske in the frame.
Heroes of the domestic show business also appeared in a couple of other competition films - in the film &quot;Elephant&quot; Sergei Shnurov played a truck driver transporting a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets discussed his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel because of a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also had a noticeable show feel – there was no boredom at any of them.
At a round table devoted to the fate of Russian arthouse, the chairman of the Russian Cinema Support Fund, Sergei Tolstikov, staged a picturesque squabble with critics: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he menacingly asked those gathered.
“I write them,” the president of ERVEZS! Andrey Plakhov answered in confusion.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko&#39;s film &quot;Ovsyanki&quot; was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the Mostra selectors decided that an extra Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films from major festivals have been shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa&#39;s film My Happiness, which competed with Mikhalkov and Weerasethakun for the Azure Beret in the spring, took part in the competition.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of his former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa’s film at all, but under pressure from his colleagues he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The award for best debut, &quot;Missing in Action,&quot; was received by the daughter
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to commit monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely directed, cathartic film experience, directed by a misanthrope with a mathematical background, that asks only one thing: start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls his films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the viewer’s joy lies in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult film of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition – a director’s star has been born.
Impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor&#39;s life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive organs falls on the hero’s head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it’s useful to work not only with debutants,” producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, collecting her prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull out the “inner debutant” from the leading figure of Russian art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - today in our cinema the big shots are moving towards the youth.
And not the other way around.
A documentary film shot in such a way that it blows your mind even more than a similar feature film.
The author is interested in both a screwdriver probing an electric meter and a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron skillet—all of which turns the story of an unemployed miner, his gap-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a veritable oil painting.
Short film competition winner Nikolai Sokolov tries out the black-and-white style of the French New Wave on the world of residential areas.
Although Godard&#39;s montage moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, thanks for the rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
“Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 type take to the skies, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (“dry ice”), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break up” the clouds heading for the city with these reagents. The particles of the substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and exactly in the place where the cloud was impacted.”
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film starring Michael York.
Recently, Carl Rinsch (who already has a remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon on his schedule), who is famous for his commercials, was appointed director.
Previously, the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) were linked to the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a rotoscoped 80s fantasy cartoon and plans to turn it into a major motion picture.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and lots of drawn boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to take a close look at the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation for the near future as he plans to remake Dario Argento&#39;s classic Giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Daming Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had previously collaborated on Day of the Dead and made Two Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte to Join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in &#39;Arthur&#39; Remake
&quot;I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China,&quot; Chen says.
— Chinese women today run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies this power.&quot;
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is this a coincidence?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both I play the dream woman.
But... that&#39;s how the director saw me, that&#39;s how he presented me, and many probably think that&#39;s how I am in life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is completely different from his character.
How did you find a common language? What is it like on the set?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought: “Yeah... this is not going to be easy for me.”
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, nothing would have worked out for us.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We became great, dare I say it, friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, about how I was afraid that I wouldn’t succeed, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he happily gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming go in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I visited for the first time.
I have never been on tour there, neither on vacation nor as a child.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city you want to return to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone is always on time.
It turns out that it wasn&#39;t difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy?
You know, I&#39;m not a professional actor.
And I am a very trusting person by nature.
If I came and agreed to work with a director, then I, in fact, entrust myself into his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will mold.
I understand perfectly well that it is more visible from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director, for a very long time, it is not even me talking to him, but he conducting preliminary conversations with me and explaining extremely clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, multi-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic quality you’re talking about.
And how was it working with the film’s director, Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone: the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly the situation.
No sleep, no food for days - and it doesn&#39;t matter, no matter thunder or hail.
And if something didn’t work out, it was a disaster, and something had to be done urgently to make it work.
It&#39;s very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so obsessed with what they do to the point of morbid fanaticism, it can’t fail, because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios are you giving up?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don&#39;t want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, that convey nothing.
I don’t want to work just to appear on screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I&#39;m not the kind of person who draws up charts.
The script arrived, I was interested in it, and today the premiere happened.

A report from the set of Tony Scott&#39;s new thriller, in which Denzel Washington saves the world again
GLASNOST BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on in Moscow almost non-stop: American film festivals - &quot;Amfest&quot;, &quot;2tomgo&quot;, &quot;2-t-1&quot; will start in a few days, followed by the British film festival.
And here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting: half of my acquaintances constantly discuss how someone needs to be boycotted and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, forgive me - very vague reasons.
Yet when one of these festivals is ceremoniously closed by a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice.
The last thing I want to do is grumble about this, but if you buy a ticket and stay in the theater looking at giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then they will continue to show them to you.
Meanwhile, this issue has no pixels: Tron: Legacy (a sequel to the classic virtual reality film), Let the Right One In (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), Unstoppable (another Tony Scott take on the train theme), and a wildly detailed story about how the films about Conan, the Barbarian, the Destroyer, and the Governor were made.

The multi-part fairy tale about a cute bespectacled sorcerer is nearing its end.
And even though fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it all ends, and those who don’t know anything about the word “Expelliarmus” will stay at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November is practically reserved for Harry.
By the way, the studios aren&#39;t fools either: in order to prolong the viewer&#39;s pleasure and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise at the end, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will last until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
History of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher&#39;s new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the Internet sphere, which united the whole world, divided five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is equally brilliant in the title role as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and loyalties.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly for sport, and partly because IT&#39;S just &quot;cool.&quot;
The idea itself and its implementation may seem elemental and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The Social Network&#39;s strengths are evident from the very first frame, particularly in the pre-credits scene where Zuckerberg talks to his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) at a bar: screenwriter Aaron Sorkin&#39;s crisp, hard-hitting dialogue picks up steam here and doesn&#39;t let up until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher&#39;s direction: comparatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss twins, the actors are dissimilar to each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed onto the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara has been cast as the lead in Fincher&#39;s next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a cold shoulder on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few companion friends begin to deteriorate and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sunny in places, cosy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal battles.
Outside of the constant stream of discussions, not much happens in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg&#39;s legal troubles hardly amount to an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story that is not very generous with details?
After watching it, there is a strong feeling that “The Social Network” is a portrait of our time, and the understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing much the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that daily solvency has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is upset that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stamping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful and athletic can’t also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If you wanted, The Social Network could easily have been a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close a book if there is even the slightest hint of something like this in it.
But here it won&#39;t even be necessary: in their version of history it doesn&#39;t matter at all.
&quot;How does it feel to be beautiful?&quot; asks Tre VeaNez&#39;s &quot;WaBu Woz&#39;te A Vsp Map,&quot; which pre-credits the song.
The hero doesn&#39;t know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little sense of beauty and even less sense of emotion.
A tasteful character drama about a high-profile internet-era trial
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames among people of humble origin had not yet really begun to appear.
They got by with the title &quot;such and such, such and such&#39;s son.&quot;
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames after the father.
But sometimes, for example in the case of the father&#39;s repeated marriages, a matronym was used - a nickname based on the mother&#39;s name.
Susanin is just such a case: “Ivan, son of Susanna.”
Serfs of small landowners actually managed without surnames for a long time - why have one when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of estates with thousands of people were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already had surnames without exception at the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the land, but released him on a quitrent - let him earn money with a craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where his surname had to be entered.
By the time serfdom was abolished in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on quitrent.
This means they already had surnames.
Forensic experts from the capital have arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic experts from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in the building at 39 Lineynaya, NGS reports.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization &quot;Mezhregiongaz&quot;, inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked sloppily, and, on the contrary, inflated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in building No. 39, where they were changing the stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments they installed a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture occurred in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This resulted in a major collapse of the building, killing 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
Sea surge flood avoided in St. Petersburg
Arguments of the Week.

Experts were able to prevent the flooding by closing the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the water level situation is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This helps prevent flooding that could follow stronger winds.
8 arrested in Turkey over poor work in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in Turkey&#39;s Sanliurfa province in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed in the earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk reports this.
The earthquake that struck Turkey on February 6 killed more than 20,000 people.
The number of injured exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader and the country&#39;s president
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyyed Ali Khamenei and President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ebrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress was informed about this by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Seyyed Ali Khamenei says:
&quot;Your Eminence,
I sincerely congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions are of particular importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will in the future have even greater achievements for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life.&quot;
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi reads, in particular: “Your Excellency, please accept my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of particular importance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the well-being of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.

Caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth caught on camera
A World War II bomb exploded in the English port city of Great Yarmouth on Friday while bomb disposal experts were trying to defuse it.
The powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk Police said that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the troops involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
&quot;The device detonated shortly after work began to defuse it.
Fortunately, all personnel are safe.
&quot;Agencies have begun assessing the damage,&quot; Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Constable Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses 24 km away.

The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the River Yare, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, Great Yarmouth stands.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand rampart around it, and a cordon was set up at a distance of 200 meters, preventing outsiders from entering.
Bomb disposal experts initially planned to use a robot to cut the fuse off the bomb on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of &quot;slowly burning&quot; the explosives.
It was during this burning process that the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain alone.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, Alesya Solovey, a research fellow at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, told BELTA.
The proportion of women among candidates of science and doctors of science is also growing: among candidates of science, women make up 41.1%, and among doctors of science - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical science, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, with women accounting for 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is 10.2% more than in the republic as a whole.
Among candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
Among the teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among vice-rectors for scientific, educational and training work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The largest number of women are among senior lecturers and teachers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among associate professors in departments is also high (55.2%).
According to the national public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the opportunities for women in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype that “science is a male sphere of activity.”
More than half of the country&#39;s residents do not hold the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
&quot;The transformation of gender ideas about women&#39;s research competence in the public consciousness helps attract young women to science, develop their creative potential, and form a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring,&quot; noted Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is celebrated annually as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop scientific careers and recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the world&#39;s researchers.-0-
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have taken place recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened – prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing, but budget expenditure is growing.
At the same time, inflationary risks have increased overall.
&quot;Therefore, this year the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of a rate decrease.
The advisability of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation,” said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced influence of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, a rapid acceleration of consumption in conditions of increased inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of labor and the growth of labor productivity is lagging behind the growth of wages.
There are also still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator’s future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted increase in inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5-7%.
This may require a higher key rate trajectory than was envisaged in October, she said.
In the Central Bank&#39;s updated forecast for this year and next, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
&quot;This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hike may be needed to bring inflation in line with the target of close to 4% in 2024,” the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets to be launched and operations with investment units to be resumed.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, the management company must allocate them into a separate closed mutual fund before September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to closed.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is being introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of transferring blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are sold, management companies are required to pay the owners of investment units at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the industry results, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger turnover of air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to additionally allocate 100 billion rubles to airlines and recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
&quot;Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (RUB 25.3 billion has been allocated so far), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, to 103.0 million people,&quot; PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem when a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist’s relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems and was only released from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain in cars at the border waiting to cross into Austria.
This thus serves as a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already completed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those wishing to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants become victims of smugglers and end up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
This is why, according to the police, increased control is needed.
Vienna&#39;s move to tighten checks follows a pledge by European Union leaders to spend more on cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the bloc&#39;s borders.
According to Frontex, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Progress 83 cargo spacecraft successfully docked with ISS
The Progress 83 automated resupply ship successfully docked with the International Space Station at 3:45 GMT on Saturday, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast from NASA&#39;s Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
The cargo ship was greeted from the ISS by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from Russia&#39;s Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent sinking on February 18.
As the company&#39;s press service clarified, the ship&#39;s transition hatch was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 is isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated.&quot;
The Mission Control Center also reported that the ISS crew is not in any danger: “The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
The crew&#39;s lives and health are not in danger and they are feeling well.&quot;
&quot;There have been more cases of maternity tourism.&quot;
How Pregnant Russians Got Stuck in Argentina
Argentina&#39;s Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child but did not remain to live in the country.
Earlier, the republic&#39;s authorities refused entry to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for the purpose of &quot;birth tourism.&quot;
On February 11, they were finally allowed into Argentina by court order.
For more details, see the article in Gazeta.Ru.
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received them through the birth of a child but did not remain to live in the country.
The director of the service, Florencia Carignano, told the C5N television channel about this.
&quot;What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country),&quot; she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person &quot;spent a month in Argentina and never came back.&quot;
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, on February 9 it became known that three pregnant Russian women were &quot;stuck&quot; at an airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission attributes the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but these three in particular were issued with a notice of non-admission to the country.
&quot;They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing them into the country is providing incomplete, false, distorted information,&quot; Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, Argentina&#39;s immigration service, following a court decision, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
&quot;An hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina,&quot; TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, Great Britain and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a &quot;boom in birth tourism&quot; to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women planning to give birth there.
&quot;In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand,&quot; he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women in recent months.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has fallen in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become 25% more expensive throughout the country, Patrol of St. Petersburg reports with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
Argentina&#39;s immigration service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country because the purpose of their visit that they stated turned out to be false.
TASS reports this with reference to the Todo Noticias TV channel.
Over the course of five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, the country&#39;s representatives did not allow the Russian women to enter Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for action if there are suspicions about &quot;false&quot; travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in her 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly tell where she is going on vacation, then the migration service immediately suspects her.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler “in such conditions.”
The artist&#39;s decision to leave the theatre was planned.
Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation Alexander Filippenko stated that the decision of the Mossovet Theatre not to renew its contract with him was planned, and in addition, everything was agreed upon with the management in advance.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax agency.
In the productions in which he took part, invite artists from the second cast.
The People&#39;s Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract expired in 2022.
All the details had long been agreed upon with the theatre representatives.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew his contract.
Filippenko noted that the management met him halfway and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that he “didn’t let anyone down.”
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is planning to undergo &quot;long-term treatment&quot; in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor works in the Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Mossovet in such plays as &quot;Shakespeare Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and also &quot;Three Sisters&quot;.
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from private sector territories in the Kalinin Autonomous Okrug.
This information was shared by the city mayor&#39;s office.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets in the private sector in the Kalininsky district from which snow needs to be cleared by spring.
The roads will be cleared in two stages.
The first will end on February 15th, and the second will run from March 1st to April 15th.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup.
Authorities reported that contractors are encountering residents dumping snow on the roadway.
Kirkorov wins lawsuit against fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man stated that the artist’s construction was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Channel Five writes about this.
However, the Saratov fisherman was unable to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented to the court, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the celebrity&#39;s house.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, clarifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star&#39;s lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist&#39;s house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky specified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that place it is possible to cast the spinning rod further.
Somnologist names causes of sleep problems
Sleep doctor Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep “ragged”, which means it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the excitability threshold of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, a somnologist recommends avoiding spicy foods in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep it is necessary not only to maintain the external temperature regime - the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, one should not overindulge in heavy food before bed, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest regimen and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg Names Trump&#39;s Competitor in the Upcoming Presidential Elections: In the World: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the former president&#39;s main competitor in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican DeSantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for president, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, DeSantis&#39; team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and is conducting preliminary surveys.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports on a planned off-site meeting for Republican Party leaders and government officials scheduled for the end of February.
The agency reports that the Florida governor&#39;s team is seeking support from fellow Republicans in Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts have named DeSantis as Donald Trump&#39;s main potential competitor.
Experts believe that the current Florida governor is well-known enough that he does not need to start an election campaign right now, and also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis supported Donald Trump&#39;s presidential bid in 2017 and could challenge him in the November 2024 presidential election.
Donald Trump has formally announced his intention to run for president &quot;to make America great again&quot;... during a speech to supporters in Florida.
Incumbent President Joe Biden, despite assurances from his team about his intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, has stated that there is no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform to take place in France on Saturday
France&#39;s trade unions staged their fourth day of mass protests against pension reform on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media report.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in the protests last Tuesday compared to the first two &quot;days of mobilization,&quot; the unions hope to bring more protesters onto the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect from 600 thousand to 800 thousand protesters across the country, including from 90 thousand to 120 thousand in Paris, the media writes.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in protests against pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), announced 2 million protesters.
Also, according to the VKT, 400 thousand protesters took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was 1.27 million, according to police estimates, and 2.8 million, according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented a government-developed pension reform project that provides for increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
The retirement age threshold is expected to gradually shift from 62 to 64 by three months per year, a process that will continue until 2030.
The new regime will apply starting with generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced during the 2022 election campaign his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government&#39;s draft pension reform.

More than 180 road accidents occurred in Astana in one day: 11 February 2023, 14:10
ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital&#39;s police department calls on people to be extremely careful on the roads, to take into account the impact of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in the grip of the road surface in icy conditions.
Over the past 24 hours, 181 road accidents were registered.
This was reported by MIA &quot;Kazinform&quot; with reference to the press service of the Astana city police department.
&quot;Pedestrians should also be careful on the road, since their violation of the rules for crossing the roadway also often leads to serious consequences.
This year, there have been 11 cases of collisions with pedestrians who were crossing the roadway in violation of established requirements; all 11 pedestrians received bodily injuries.
In total, 35 road accidents have been registered since the beginning of the year, in which 3 people died and 39 people received bodily injuries of varying severity.
In order to prevent road traffic injuries, since the beginning of the year, the capital&#39;s police have stopped more than 16 thousand traffic violations, detained 213 drunk drivers, and fined more than 1,600 pedestrian violators.
13 drivers with fake state registration plates and 86 drivers for driving vehicles without state registration plates were detained.
Progress MS-21 depressurization occurred on the ISS: 12 February 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS, Kazinform reports with reference to TASS.
&quot;The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the sinking of which is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received by the Mission Control Center,&quot; the Roscosmos press service reported.
It is noted that at the moment it is isolated from the general volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated; it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by Roscosmos Executive Director for Manned Space Programs Sergei Krikalev.
&quot;On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a leak of coolant from the temperature control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS note) in mid-December,&quot; he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the Soyuz came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with future launches.
&quot;We need to do a deep analysis to make sure that this reason does not extend to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now face us,” he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis needs to be conducted in terms of how the spacecraft was prepared for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used to assemble the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
&quot;The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error,&quot; Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that a commission began work on Saturday to conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
&quot;The ship was supposed to be undocking and descending from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz ship (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS note), so there will be no serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew... From this point of view, this will not affect the program,&quot; Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the Poisk small research module of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the place where Progress was depressurized
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the coolant has been released.
&quot;This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermal control system into space, the coolant leak has stopped,&quot; said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, due to depressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos reported that the cosmonauts are not in any danger.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and will be removed from orbit, according to plan, on February 18.
The coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, John Kirby, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told journalists about this at a briefing, which was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he had &quot;nothing to announce regarding additional destinations&quot; for the American leader&#39;s trip to Poland.
The day before, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden&#39;s visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
During the trip, the US president will discuss bilateral cooperation with Polish leaders, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO&#39;s deterrence capabilities, an administration spokeswoman said.
Earlier, Kirby said Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but now is not the time for official visits.
Fitness Expert Shares How To Work Out Outdoors In Winter To Lose Weight
Fitness expert calls winter walks a great way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Yeung talks about effective outdoor interval training for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the portal Eat This, Not That.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
&quot;Walk at a normal pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk for one minute as fast as you can without running.
&quot;One minute at a normal pace,&quot; explains Eng.
Three approaches must be done.
Next, the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, after which you walk at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
This sequence should be repeated five times. Then, Yeng suggests alternating between active walking (two minutes) and calm walking (one minute) three more times.
You should finish your walk with a five-minute walk at a leisurely pace and some stretching exercises.
In total, this workout will require 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, Master of Sports in Track and Field Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev gave advice on choosing equipment for winter jogging in a commentary to Lenta.ru.
&quot;You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, and special lightweight but warm headwear.
Winter running shoes are distinguished by denser materials, a higher platform and a tread on the sole,&quot; the athlete said.

The head of Serpukhov checked the contents of the apartment building
The head of the urban district of Serpukhov, Sergei Nikitenko, made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the contents of apartment and residential buildings.
The addresses from which the most requests from residents were received were under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and concern, first of all, the cleaning of entrances and the maintenance of common areas.
Serpukhov residents themselves do not stand aside and actively fight the problem of vandalism, which is especially widespread in terms of graffiti.
We will work on this issue taking into account the Safe Region cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergei Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of post boxes, light bulbs, installation of wires in boxes, and untimely removal of garbage from container sites.
Management companies must solve all the tasks set before them as soon as possible.
Deputy General Director of Russian Railways proposed to the Governor of Irkutsk Region to develop new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales areas other than the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of Russian Railways Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our &quot;related partners&quot; (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for the transportation of their products using new schemes, - emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of stable shipment of products; Irkutsk Oblast is one of the richest regions of the Russian Federation in mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
There are about 25 enterprises engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of product shipments for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
If additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market appear, then we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
On behalf of the head of the region, Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Angara region, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region today.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Chairman of the Government got acquainted with the work of the new educational institution - Granovskaya School, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project &quot;Modern School&quot; of the national project &quot;Education&quot;.
The eight school blocks house classrooms, a canteen, a food block, an assembly hall, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, bathrooms, common recreation areas, and a medical block.
The federal budget allocated 240.8 million rubles for the construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipality.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening, in addition to children from the village of Granovshchina, the school also included children from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing major repairs.
Classes are taught by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under the federal program.
Major repairs of Khomutovskaya Secondary Comprehensive School No. 2 began in 2022.
Primary school students were assigned to Khomutovskaya School No. 1, while senior classes are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, utilities, windows and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, and the interior decoration will be completed.
An important component of the major overhaul is the reconstruction of a heating station with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all works is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stages, problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in power is needed, work is underway with the energy supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to electrical networks by developers.
It was decided that the grid company would organize a personal meeting next week to resolve these issues legally.
- Very often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population increasingly uses electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those areas where active construction is underway must pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant farms of the UOB
The head of the UOB, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three peasant farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
The head of a peasant farm in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant to develop her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main activities of the farm is the production of livestock products.
Every year the number of livestock increases and the gross production of meat and milk increases.
Later, thanks to government support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm.
Today, the farm has about 150 cattle, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they grow grain crops and sow annual forage crops.
Thanks to the activities of Viktor Katanaev&#39;s peasant farm, the Kharyashino area in the village of Kulunkun has been transferred to the category of populated areas.
The farm is engaged in raising and fattening dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy farm for 60 heads of cattle.
Today the farm has 150 heads of cattle.
Potato cultivation has also been practiced here for many years.
The head of the peasant farm tries to create all the necessary conditions for work and living for the team.
There is now an entire village on the farm&#39;s territory.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control of the issue of construction of two kilometers of road from the Kharyashino area to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of Stalina Mogzoeva&#39;s peasant farm in the village of Otonkhoy are cattle and buffalo breeding.
In 2020, the farm took part in a competitive selection and received a grant from AGROSTARTAP for the development of a meat-producing farm.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the number of livestock and increases gross meat production.
In addition, the peasant farm sows annual forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a feedlot.
Following a visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that government support measures are effective, necessary, and essential.
- The government of the Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and enhanced.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor, - emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
Armenian-Turkish border crossing opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border crossing on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish Anadolu Agency.
Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the southern Turkish city of Adiyaman on Saturday, Ankara&#39;s special representative to the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kilic said.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
&quot;I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region,&quot; Kilic wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara Bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then, aid collected by the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster area in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-affected areas.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that the death toll in Turkey has risen to 21,848.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are marred mainly by Ankara&#39;s refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire and its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Türkiye appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border to third-country nationals as soon as possible.

Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makhachev received a prestigious award from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), becoming the winner of the &quot;Submission of the Year&quot; award for his early victory in a fight with Brazilian Charles Oliveira.
&quot;Submission of the Year&quot;.

Crespo names strengths of Enzo Fernandes, who joined Chelsea for €121m
Former Argentina national team footballer Hernan Crespo commented on the transfer of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez to London&#39;s Chelsea.
In particular, he said that he was impressed by the footballer’s performance at the recent World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be a great addition to the Blues, as he can play in different positions.
&quot;Fernandez is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in Makelele&#39;s position, he can play there very well.
&quot;The guy also has a good eye for goal, a good shot from outside the box, so if you need him to play behind a striker like Lampard or Essien, he can do that,&quot; Crespo told British media.
Let us recall that Enzo Fernandes moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros.
At the 2022 World Cup, he played 7 matches, scored 1 goal and made 1 assist.

Mogilny played in the NHL for Buffalo, Vancouver, New Jersey and Toronto, while Fedorov defended the colors of Detroit, Anaheim, Columbus and Washington.
By the way, in 2000 Mogilny became the winner of the Stanley Cup, and Fedorov won the main NHL trophy three times: in 1997, 1998 and 2002.

Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Well-known TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
&quot;Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero&#39;s homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a footballer who committed crimes.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one could squander their potential like Kokorin.
Mamaev, despite all his talents, was occasionally noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and to realize himself somewhere else,” Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev as saying.
The 34-year-old midfielder&#39;s last club was Khimki.
The Moscow Region club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar and Rostov.
Mamaev is a Russian champion, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup and a two-time winner of the Russian Super Cup as part of CSKA.

A tanker with diesel from a vessel previously sailing under the Russian flag was not allowed into a Spanish port
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine of the Spanish Ministry of Transport has prohibited the Maersk Magellan from entering the city&#39;s port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
&quot;The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan, a vessel under the Singapore flag, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the Cameroonian-flagged vessel Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in line with EU legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from 16 April 2022 or that changed flag after 24 February 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first case in which ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Maltese-flagged Black Star, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling on seaborne oil deliveries from the Russian Federation imposed by unfriendly countries has been in effect.
At that time, the ceiling on Russian oil was set at $60/bbl.
Also, since December 5, the EU has been embargoing seaborne oil supplies from Russia.
Problems with entry into Argentina for pregnant Russian women explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of people wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country&#39;s authorities have begun to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are related to the fact that the country&#39;s authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This was reported by Lenta.ru with reference to St. Petersburg State University professor Viktor Kheifets, editor-in-chief of the magazine Latin America.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country becoming a transit point rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will decide whether to grant the parents an Argentine passport after receiving a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina have become especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Let us recall that Argentina grants citizenship by &quot;right of soil&quot;, that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began revoking the residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the reasons for their trip.
Russia predicts opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, citizens&#39; interest in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format, may open in the country.
Around 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
As Kommersant reports, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
These data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Society.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, told the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their numbers have decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite different figures.
According to Kontur.Fokus, over the past three years the number of organizations with the main activity of &quot;fitness center operation&quot; has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover in 2021.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have begun to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis levels.
Management company from Kirov has had its license revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has revoked the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings issued to the management company &quot;Zabota&quot;.
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company &quot;Zabota&quot; was revoked.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into force in February 2023.
The arbitration court revoked the management company&#39;s license because the organization ignored the State Housing Inspectorate&#39;s orders several times.
Currently, all objects that were under the management of &quot;Care&quot; have been excluded from the register of licenses for the implementation of entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they are left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor&#39;s office about the current situation.
Let us recall that in January 2023, the Governor of the Kirov Region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region&#39;s management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor&#39;s demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They contacted the regional prosecutor&#39;s office and asked that Sokolov be held administratively liable.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Anti-monopoly authorities also allegedly asked the prosecutor&#39;s office to check the legality of the regional leader&#39;s actions.
Wildberries will make bags at pick-up points paid
The Wildberries marketplace will make packages at order pick-up points paid from February 13.
Their cost will vary from 6 to 15 rubles.
Currently, packages are provided by the owners of pick-up points.
In case of their absence, a fine is imposed.
From Monday, February 13, packages can no longer be taken for free from Wildberries pick-up points.
Marketplace users received a notification stating that buyers who need the package will have to pay between 6 and 15 rubles for it.
This amount will be debited from the card specified in your personal account.
As the company indicated, this step will help reduce the use of plastic and will contribute to the preservation of nature.
As follows from the appendix to the offer for the provision of services for the delivery of parcels to individuals, the contractor, that is, the person who opened the pick-up point, must provide packages free of charge at the request of the client.
Moreover, they must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
Packages are purchased at the expense of the owners of the pick-up points; if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are subject to a fine of 10,000 rubles for each violation.
Previously, Wildberries clients caught the platform writing off funds from cards whose data had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
This comes with major security risks, buyers fear.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to write off money from deleted cards without notifying the client if payment from others does not go through for one reason or another.
Commenting on the situation, the company stated that settlements with customers are carried out with the permission of the clients, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place, especially in summer, with gazebos with barbecues around the mammoth sculpture.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Opening hours from 10:00 to 22:00.
You can drink coffee and have a snack of freshly baked goods in the shop.
There is a small parking lot next to the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Comfortable cafeteria area
My daughter and I came to apply for a pension.
They welcomed me warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned my documents, filled out my application, and told me how to sign up for subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security greet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it wouldn’t hurt to buy a water cooler.
We came twice, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, goodness, luck and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Simply a magnificent place!
After a long walk along the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine and waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply amazing!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The nice cashier asked me if I wanted to take my coffee with me or make it in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, that&#39;s why &quot;in the hall&quot;.
They did this to me.
I ask why in a glass and not in a cup.
The girl replies that they don’t have 300 ml cups.
How does this fit into a person’s head?
Ask with you or in the hall, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To confront the person with the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelenaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I want. I asked for one myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Cafeteria Green Outskirts and Green Outskirts - are they sides of the same coin or are they organizations that are not connected in any way?
If not related, understanding appears.
If they are related, why did a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality descend to the rhetoric of a kiosk at the Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time a similar incident has happened to me.
I don’t rule out that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on intuition.
I hope I&#39;m wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to contact the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not interfere.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year&#39;s program.
We were a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a number with magic tricks and more animals.
It&#39;s a pity that you can&#39;t take pictures with animals in the lobby anymore.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall, it&#39;s a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and to delight us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, he chooses good places for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to look at the complex, when there weren’t even any walls yet, so that we could see everything in person, although we looked at so many apartments and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia&#39;s favorite ski resort!
The best thing is the gentle, sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the routes, in my opinion, are boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector E, where it’s more or less the same.
But overall there is a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
She did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, cloakroom and water available.
Disgusting service.
This is the second time I come to pick up my order at the time indicated in the app and wait for my order by the windowsill for more than 30 minutes.
Today in business such service is unacceptable!
The response from the &quot;care&quot; service is: we are trying.
At the checkout, without even an apology, they simply said: “It’s not our fault, it’s the program.”
You didn’t find any way to call to warn or any other technical means of communication with previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are “trying”, but business must work.
Thank you all, we&#39;re all leaving.
We will not order from you again and will certainly not recommend you.
A bad mood, waiting for guests, and the hostess&#39;s apologies are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania complied).
In the end, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very warm), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge available.
The only drawback is that there is too little space, and the shower in the bathroom is terribly small.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, so we had to borrow a dryer from the owners and push it in place of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But overall it’s a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those who want to drink.
Moscow center, I recommend
Great place with very friendly staff, we will definitely come again.
The territory has all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
The rooms are well-maintained and have all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around it during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, both Russia in miniature, and the Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We shop here all the time, the prices are low and the quality is top notch!
Very helpful staff, will help and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is as convenient for you.
For me personally it&#39;s normal.
They serve quickly, unless one of the visitors is being slow.
It&#39;s convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will give you advice, direction, and consultation even if you come outside of reception hours.
In principle it&#39;s normal.
Great guys!
Thanks a lot!
They did everything quickly and efficiently, the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was a throwaway, but they were so smart and did everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery in 2 hours for March 8th.
Flowers were delivered in 6 hours in packaging, as if they had been stolen (there was barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them and it turned out that there was an even number of tulips, 20 pieces.
WhatsApp support responded to my complaints about the color and number of colors by saying &quot;apparently the colors were mixed up.&quot;
The next day I wrote again and they offered to refund 15%.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office regarding the fact that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to get involved with this organization.
I have been going to the master Samira for more than 10 years for hair coloring and cutting.
I want to cancel the professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always happy with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client&#39;s wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I confidently recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!&#39;
Many thanks to Master Samira 😍
Hello, I was in this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are many gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
On the downside, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if you take “normal gaming process” then computers don’t handle it well :(
That&#39;s why the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to his group to exercise, and my mother goes to fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the trainers are professional.
They organize themed parties for children and monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It&#39;s nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child can already withstand a blow well and has strong general physical training.
Recommended for children, mothers and fathers)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
She does quality work, is caring, and clarifies everything.
You can always talk about something with girls!
It was the third time!
I will never regret it!
Finally I can grow my hair after bleaching!!!
Vita also studies coloristics.
That&#39;s why she will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
The service manager Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the scheduled maintenance.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out with high quality.
The only thing that confused me when signing up for maintenance was the insufficiently correct information on the work regulations; when I showed up for maintenance, the regulations were explained more clearly.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Administration staff.
I needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction. The employees greeted me very kindly and helped me get this certificate, although they could have refused, since this is not part of their duties.
Thanks a lot!
There are very warm-hearted people working here.
Wonderful, warm, polite employees, I don&#39;t regret that I came to this hairdresser!👍
Master Nahida did a perfect highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend her to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, it was also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly wonderful lecture
We have known Olya for over 3 years and use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged friends, which only evokes admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, they will pick up/take away by zootaxi.
And they will also bring something clean and tasty)
it&#39;s a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude towards our pets 🐕💜
The restaurant Syty Los is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book your seats in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
A nice, well-kept zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We were there on weekdays - entrance for adults 300₽, schoolchildren 170.
There were few people, we had a great time walking around and looking at the animals.
The anteater was impressive)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes on the territory with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, we also saw a phone charging station.
Overall, I recommend it 👍
The salon is top notch!!!
I am very pleased with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I do various types of facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
She explains everything in detail about the features of my skin, she selected cosmetics that take care of my skin type, it’s just perfect.
Now I walk around happy and beautiful!!!
Thanks to Natalia!!!
Excellent club with huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hamam and excellent trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it were a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women&#39;s section.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three and that’s only because of the first visit, when I got to the consultant, Timur, if I’m not mistaken, but I could be wrong.
He completed everything quickly, explained everything +/-, everything was clear, my son also decided to complete the card, and alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, clients were waiting, a consultant approached my son, who didn&#39;t care, he looked away several times in the negotiating room, cheerfully discussing something, in the end my son left without completing anything, when he was leaving, the consultant said, well, if you don&#39;t want to, as you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It&#39;s a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards clients does not depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their range and helps in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slender girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located close to the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommended!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat your fill or order again.
The only complaint is the table reservation.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
There&#39;s nothing more to it.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free seats and they were able to accommodate us.
But in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
Went for a cleaning this past weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost care and suggested how and what is best to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I highly recommend it, the only clinic that I can remember that doesn&#39;t want to rip you off.
Good shopping center.
We have everything!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
I&#39;ll never set foot in that store again.
We bought a washing machine and were told that we were going out of town, so we would take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall told me where to drive to the warehouse, when I asked &quot;will they load it?&quot; he said yes.))
They took it out of the warehouse without a box, when I asked why, they said that&#39;s how they load everything.
when I started insisting, they shoved in two strips of foam plastic, saying that would do!
They refused to load it into the trailer, saying it wasn&#39;t their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
when I said that I would then refuse the order altogether, they said, “Yes, whatever you want, we don’t care,” but in the end one of them condescended to go down the ramp and help my father push the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I&#39;ve encountered such rude service.
Good shopping center. Clean and tidy. Large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema &quot;Kosmik&quot; and an entertainment children&#39;s center &quot;Nevidalia&quot;.
On the ground floor there is a large hypermarket &quot;Lenta&quot;.
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
A good supermarket of cosmetics, lingerie and household goods.
A varied selection, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help you with your choice and provide advice.
Everyone will find something they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very nice, nice place.
I advise everyone, you will never make a mistake in choosing. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go great.
I recommend visiting)
We would like to thank Marina Chasovaya, who served as our funeral agent.
Having arrived to us on call, she took upon herself the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we saw off our loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized and clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of our loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
Enticed by the many good reviews, I contacted RemStiRMash and they assigned me a master, Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready to serve.
We discussed everything and set a time - 2:00 pm.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated request (how is that? Where is &quot;completely free?&quot;) and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 2:00 PM, he will show up after 6:00 PM.
We agreed to do it again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another technician calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of trick is this?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned activities are put to the side!
In short, a competent technician, Ivan, arrived and fixed the problem, for which I thank him.
So don&#39;t fall for empty promises and don&#39;t waste your time.
The evening observations did not meet expectations at all.
First there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children tried to watch several times, adults crowded around and couldn’t let others watch.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of a normal star, and can be viewed for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions in an inaccessible manner, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many of the nuances.
It&#39;s not clear what 600 rubles is for.
Amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit down and eat 2-3 dishes for two (very large portions) + a cocktail, about 2500 RUR👌
There are some interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho, I highly recommend trying it.
Price 420 RUR for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don’t know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely advise my friends to go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for quite a long time, since they opened.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed already, and it still works properly and is in good condition.
That’s why when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we got everything we needed right here.
Excellent gas station!!!
It is very conveniently located, there is security from the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I have been filling up twice a week for more than 2 years, no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Orlyata accepts cards and cash, and does not cheat in terms of volume.
I liked the store!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help you with your choice.
I bought a laptop for my daughter for her studies, because her laptop broke.
They helped, picked it out, gave a guarantee (one month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped me choose the wine because it was hard to figure out such a big menu on my own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, Vasily is charming, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - it was magical, respect to the chef.
The kids&#39; menu is like everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it&#39;s FIRE here!
Adults liked the one with truffle, and children liked the one with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - they were the bomb, soft, juicy, aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Working hours: from 10:00 to 21:00, 7 days a week and holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the pick-up point.
Very good place.
There are real professionals working here who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It&#39;s nice that you can see and try on the product right away.
It&#39;s great that it&#39;s close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and comfortable.
Everything stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entry, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theatre.
We often go to different performances.
Today we went to the performance &quot;The Frog Princess&quot;.
At the moment, this is the best of all children&#39;s performances.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even my 14 year old son went just to be with us and said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I spent 10 days on holiday in January 2023.
The holiday was a &quot;5&quot; success, I liked everything!
Let me start from the beginning:
On the day of arrival they called, asked what time to expect us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), we got there quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, they processed the paperwork quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (no heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies&#39; table with a large mirror, a refrigerator that is not very small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linens at your request, but if you don’t ask for them to be changed, they change them anyway on the 4th day, the linens are of good quality.
The area is well-kept, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to public transport stop.
There are friendly guys in the dining room who will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but it depends on what you come for, we were perfectly satisfied with everything, both the choice and the quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, vegetables as a side dish every day, their own delicious baked goods, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, they always bake pancakes for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not so good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 C°, sunny.
We liked everything, we really had a rest.
I would like to come again, and specifically in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It’s a pity that the swimming pool and the gym complex have not been put into operation.
Thanks to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We&#39;ve been going to Polet since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) that’s the most important thing.
Let&#39;s go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
While wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to drop into this promising establishment - and we were right!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, without even a crust left.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend :)
It so happened that I ended up in Tomarovskaya hospital with high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is dietary, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, every single one of them gives both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the drip is running, they will come in and ask about your health...
I had previously had a heart ultrasound, but this was the first time (unfortunately, I don’t know the doctor’s name, he’s a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician, Klavdiya Fedorovna Vetokhina!
A true professional: attentive, competent, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heartbeat, which I could not achieve before after contacting other doctors.
Many thanks to the head physician Mevshe Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, the orderlies, and the cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
The administrator met me in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help clients with all their questions.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small store, the selection of goods is quite good.
There are semi-finished products, dairy products, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
Open 24 hours, which is very convenient, the staff is always friendly
It&#39;s great when there&#39;s a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The ski lifts are drag lifts and on weekends of course there is a queue of 40 seconds for the descent and 5-10 minutes for the queue.
But overall it’s great, immersion in an atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I contacted the service to repair my iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done efficiently.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was damaged and the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable and affordable.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, its condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention from restorers.
So 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators and not to the holders
Excellent residential complex
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, the area is clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a nice, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and varied food court.
The tables are arranged in cozy areas.
There is no crowding.
Well, we&#39;ve been there, we&#39;ve tried it...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a canteen.
Pizza... well, anyone who hasn&#39;t tried something tastier will like it, but it seemed kind of faceless to me.
I didn&#39;t really like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind you and almost always looked your interlocutor in the face.
We felt uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We will not come here again and will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever had cut and colored by.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also only take my daughter to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thanks a lot!
We are from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, the kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, we need more good people like you!
And the service there is clean and good!
We came to Sergei Chigrakov&#39;s concert.
Great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and helpful!
There is a children&#39;s room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The highest rating, I love this place ❤
The park is in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the playground for a long time now, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages to our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be purchased at Perekrestok.
The staff is friendly.
I haven&#39;t come across any bad products.
There are often promotions and discounts.
It&#39;s nice that it&#39;s close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We visited the bar twice, we liked everything, polite staff, delicious food and most importantly - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the group “Ruki Vverh Band” disappoints for the second time.
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but he also reads the lyrics to most of the songs from his phone, which was especially striking when they were songs by the group “Ruki Vverh”.
Somehow it’s illogical (performing in the bar Ruki Vverh, in the group Ruki Vverh Band).
We had a rest at the beginning of March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of my birthday, I was given a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Refill of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
The breakfasts are simply mind-blowing.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to your room, you will have to pay an extra 20% for service.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced.
The taste is a C+.
The water park was included in the price of the stay.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the massage therapist was just the bomb.
Everything was great, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs some work to maintain the brand.
A great place to get together with friends for a steam bath.
Large and comfortable steam room, billiards, outdoor swimming pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is top notch!
In a short time I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men&#39;s and 1 women&#39;s).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is excellent.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Great basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff is friendly, I order online myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
Good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good selection.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I come here often - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I&#39;m specifically talking about &quot;little frogs&quot;. Our trainer Anastasia Vitalievna is very popular with the child and is a professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love the bakery cake, the service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout never made the coffee until I reminded them, they did, it was impossible to drink, it stinks and left an aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows come here!
Victoria does excellent corrections, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of hair and skin, thanks to which the dye lasts a long time.
You can&#39;t do better eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mother&#39;s move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
Our whole family has been getting dental treatment at Novodent for a long time.
We recently treated my 8-year-old son&#39;s teeth, everything went just great, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don&#39;t have to wait long, there are no queues, since appointments are by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, lots of filling.
And I don’t understand why, but it never leaks for me.
Often when you finish your shawarma you don’t eat the bottom anymore because there’s a lot of sauce, water, well, in short, eww...., but not here.
That&#39;s why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the canteen is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good selection.
However, the big minus is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right on the sales floor.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are located directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a comment on the organization, and not on a specific store.
A stunning example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, carefully tended.
I got double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to an Event, that this was truly a coming out party.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I came across this online auto parts store by accident.
I called, gave the VIN code, and they said wait)
They called back about 10 minutes later and offered several options.
Since the car is personal and work-related, I didn’t want to save money and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
Another 5 minutes later they called back and said they had good news for you.
If you don’t buy the entire basket + disc + release, but buy the LUK basket + disc kit and the LUK release separately, it will be 2 thousand rubles cheaper, which is not very pleasing.
Having picked up the clutch, I went to the service center.
When removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel was still needed, and the sooner the better.
I already knew where I would go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone (the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was in hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am happy that everything arrived quickly and that they met me halfway.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year&#39;s party was a great success, but with some nuances.
I booked a two-seater table, but it turned out they seated me at a four-seater.
But it&#39;s not a problem.
It&#39;s just strange that they didn&#39;t warn me.
The cuisine is a four, the fish was a total failure.
The host of the contests, made on school-level Powerpoint, is, to be honest, not very good.
BUT regarding the music everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I am leaving my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work in this institution; doctors and nurses are from God.
Both in the emergency department, and in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum ward.
But I would like to express my special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Yu., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the maternity ward. Thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Wonderful shop.
Large assortment of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food was amazing, no program, the waiters were a bit cheeky, but we were in a great group with children and celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fiery supply of the plateau, the children waited.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
