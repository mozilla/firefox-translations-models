FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations."
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editorial office of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the results of the work of the Expert Session for the year and form the final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a single approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in agreement.
Following the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," - said the head of the expert and analytical department of the FANO of Russia Elena Aksenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to look for relatives among the stars, that is, those that arose from one cluster.
The results of their research were published in the journal Nature, and they can be briefly found on the university's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from those of relatives in the cluster.
The simulation results of the astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas that together formed the cloud.
This object within a few million years under the influence of its own gravity is converted into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added paint-tags to the original gas flows and found that due to the rapid turbulent stirring in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that you can search for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrat police arrested 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it drove at a speed of 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reaches 125 km / h when he left the service station on the Battle Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued to move along Burgess Road, then turned into the bushland, as a result of which the police lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the man corresponding to the driver's description were spotted near the house on Walcott Wei in Bulgarre.
Carrata's police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.

George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlohry
The man will face trial on charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged during a hearing from the High Court in Glasgow.
Presumably, he raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was "unconscious, slept and unable to give consent."
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, which is located in the Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray sentenced the hearing to the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not "cloth the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "cloth the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated.
And when we understand what European and American partners will be like this once, then we will make decisions on how to respond.
This will not be due to the slam of the doors, some resentment, falsely understood, - said the Minister.
First of all, we will build on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and will draw conclusions from the actions of partners for their adequacy, contractual and reliability.
On the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are seeking, - the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say that "they sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do it in order to punish Russia," it is probably not very adequate."
As for the WTO, Russia's withdrawal in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes," Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome, as we believe, the discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time using anti-dumping measures against the sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms and in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lira in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since lilac after the blooms loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it along with other shrubs.
It combines well with many cultures.
And next to the lilac you and need to plant plants, decorative in other terms, and blooming simultaneously with it.
Another plus lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamb tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a semblance of garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that more fits your garden design.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for the sale of counterfeit money
As reported in the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonets and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky district court.
And for the end of the investigation on the crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
The investigation proved the faults on several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, the materials of the criminal case with an indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court issued a decision to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with a stay in a colony of the general regime.
The verdict has not come into force.
Recall that last week, two more counterfeit money sellers were convicted, which were paid by them in the shops of Petrozavodsk.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One is five years in prison and the other four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
"Dervish" delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the mortgage stone to the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment named after Sedov in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first gathered twenty-three years ago, when a mortgage was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned the sea," - said the Chairman of the Council of veterans of the Northern Shipping Company Boris Karpov.
Then a city brass band performed at the event, and pupils of the cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships was also military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not detected by the enemy and successfully reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
A total of the 848 ships that took part in vital caravan operations killed 126 transport and about 50 military vessels.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where are the trade unions, there are middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive Faction Congress.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Workers" Rights Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal capacity to discriminate against trade unions as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for engaging in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and punitive payments - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is no doubt not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill offer is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have been subjected in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drafted to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, and to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans to write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek infringement of this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which compiled the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 will be adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests."
By generation, the Americans took for granted the basic provision that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should be protected as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King the Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jinadl in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to do legal abortions, continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing their powers," Judge John de Gravells wrote in a decision.
The hearing will be appointed within a month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on the law.
Defenders of the right to abortion happily met this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women are protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who has filed a lawsuit to halt the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision was to refer to the doctors from the two clinics that did not appear on the case, and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is part of 11 states that passed similar laws, and the courts recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the powers of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the authority to attend the hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for their safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors doing abortions while their applications for admission were pending.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be of Russian production, according to the State Duma deputy from the faction "Fair Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia."
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. According to the rest of the groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Nilov said.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of amendments to the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is included in a package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Taxovik," a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In the positive will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be developed faster, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break through to the shelves of local shops due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this niche is freed and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now there is a "browser moment" when the previous players have already left, and new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," - said AIF.ru the first Vice-President of the all-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors," Ph.D. Tamara Kasyanov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to secure the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies working under the unified laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots not in all articles.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to "provide" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that poor-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large retail chains, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in such a scenario, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods can affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production can cede in the quality of imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the second, as for a shortage of goods.
About the forgotten idea of import substitution in the early 2000s, economists again spoke in February of this year due to the incessant devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to oblige retailers to consider domestic manufacturers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently along the path of import substitution, and the system of planning production for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports is 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian shops.
In addition, a powerful boost can be obtained by meat production.
As is known, the largest share of imports is preserved on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still falls on Russian products," - says Kasyanov.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, because this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that a full import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees," - says the expert.
The untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research said the probability of dying 20 percent during the study in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NEEDEDEDS: New drugs may slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in the regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite the improved quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of services on the road that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home can help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the long lifespan among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Nives, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP door will open in the Kuzhery district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaybelak was started in April of this year and was conducted according to a model project.
The cost of work was a little more than 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
Here will be provided with medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybeljak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chakaskhail.
The new paramedic and obstetric post will be replaced by the current FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has exhausted its resource for a long time, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will be opened soon.
Killed a four-month-old son in a state of drunkenness, the Novocheboksarka will appear before the court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the dock of the defendants for the murder of their own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused, along with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her ium in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the Novocheboksarka decided to stay a guest and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and wept at night, a drunk woman put him next to her bed to feed his breast, but she soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, the press service of the SU TFR in Chuvashia, was sent to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions by Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper "Kommersant," this week the MAE should make "small, but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of income growth of the population.
The forecast suggested that the Russian food sanctions are in effect for the year - until August 2015.
How in such a situation could such high inflation be assumed?
The current situation is a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," - said the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and predict a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SSP) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual price growth rate will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after the Russian Federation imposed "knowable sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department of FC AForex:
The increase in prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is initiating price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rates of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of the basket of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in the quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of the inflationary component.
If we add here also the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of trust in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department "Alpari"
Inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another matter that it was then compensated for by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Magut, Asset Manager of Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being successfully constrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to soften the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But price growth begins traditionally after a summer lull and, perhaps, this fall will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5%, most likely, will be worth, as the Russian Federation has still financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the reduction in the number of homeowners
The fall, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause horticultural centers to start losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers will reach "the basic age of horticulture," according to a study by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent housing spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners spend their own homes on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urban areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking and shrinking the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, with annual sales estimated at 5 billion euros.
In Greater London, where homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK's lowest spending on household chorea.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and lacking space for the garden does not mean that humans cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: "Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can transport plants when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail merchandise for horticulture as a result of the increasing number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria held a mass cleansing in the fund "Earth"
Three of the four chiefs of the Alemen's Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Alemen Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the dismissal of the Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozan Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were calmly replaced.
The Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who until that time was responsible for state assistance and the SAPRARD program, was released, BShnez reports citing the newspaper "Labrud."
I did not attend the board of managers, because by law we are not members of the leadership, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope that I will learn more on Monday," Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of "Investment crediting" in the central fund in "Agriculture" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Up to this point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zzhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Agricultural" in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
His post was retained only by the Deputy Head of the Fund Atage Aliyev-Veli.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey urges U.S. diplomat over espionage
Turkey's foreign ministry has summoned the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain in connection with the report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Charge d'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany also made Ankara an object of intelligence, caused a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies merged against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which is China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine) is creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catch up with the wonder of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com - will not be easy.
the Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70% of it will belong to Wanda and 15% each of the Internet companies, according to the Wanda.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will bring together Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, the number of users of which is about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate objects across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and amusement park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $ 960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest operator of cinemas in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which will be developed by Alibaba's competitor.
According to Dong Ze, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger of Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, says Duncecece.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) of commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said Wanda Wang Jianlin, head of Wanda.
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, the chances of everyone are approximately equal," he said.
The Chinese e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 compared to $ 395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: it is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And it is projected that this number could grow to 850 million by 2015.
the Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huateng until recently was the richest man in China, however, according to the index of millionaires of Bloomberg, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already overtaken it by $ 5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $22.8 billion, of which $11 billion is in Alibaba.
The head of Baidu, Robin Lee, now ranks third among the richest people in China, while Wang Jianlin from Wanda is the fourth place in the rating.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even wealthier," said Cao Lei, director of the Chinese Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Rome can not be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only to new companies, but also to well-deserved leaders of world Internet trade, is evidenced by the report on Alibaba's financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost twice the same sum of competitors - it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has tremendous potential to generate money, largely due to its mobile applications," said the analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated Prospect on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company can be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The company's road-show, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held an initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in retail chains should be of Russian production, according to deputies of the state Duma.
They drafted a bill on this topic.
We are talking about amending the article. 8 Federal Law "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and in the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so they will be made a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% in the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the newspaper "Izvestia."
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was introduced in the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive in Russia farming markets, in which small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf's police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police and officials of the Calvia municipality to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the Calvia police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous center of unbridled drunkenness of Magaloufe.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the streets on which most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the Calvia municipality to the office of Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two more local policemen were arrested by the Spanish National Guards in connection with charges of corruption and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied owners of nightclubs say that protectionism by the authorities has a serious impact on the state of their business.
"We're not talking about making money anymore, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, which featured an 18-year-old British vacationer who made blowjob to 24 men during a bar race.
The authorities of the island since then are trying to stop hooliganism in a drunken state among the vacationers of Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalously known alcoholic races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident with the blowjob occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the boat's Carnage club were fined 55,000 euros ($37,000).
Magaluf's tourist resort, mostly popular among young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic intoxicated associated with the insane fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions that affected the flights to Adelaide Airport
The spring prepared a cold surprise in the south of South Australia, bringing heavy rains and heavy winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 pm, following 6.6 mm, which fell out on the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with a gusty wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave out an early portion of spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8C in the city.
The squalid conditions are thought to have served as one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shift zone - a sudden change in the speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed at around 8:40 p.m.
The flight delayed several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney, caused a subsequent delay.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to the networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
Under the FAS, an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector was created.
At its meeting, the head of the department of control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that "today's calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable price of construction, according to the FAS.
And they propose the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated standards and single prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals have been made on the road map and are under consideration in the Minstroy.
"The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction with the calculations of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained RGB Vadim Solovyov.
After all, now the estimate counts every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors."
In the Ministry of Construction with the FAS agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost on constructive elements already exist: methods have been developed to calculate the prices for constructive solutions, to prepare estimates for these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Development and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction has been chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to RGB, the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demianko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations on constructive elements, in practice, this is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert community of professionals of state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Deputy Director for Engineering of the industry center of capital construction of Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and to companies that own monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors on this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts will be as protected as possible from someone's control.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff of the customer and budget expenditures for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's specialists will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to the lack of interest in obtaining a state order for an incomplete amount of work and a small amount of the contract.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game for the attentiveness of the contractor.
And he gave such an example: "the participant when filling out the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or the equivalent," "must be," "from," "more," "less," "similate," "or," "type," "similar type," "not lower," "below," "further," "can be" "may have," "can be," "earlier," "early," "not earlier," "not allowed."
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess at the stage of applying the quality of work through the "paper" offer of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, you can really evaluate only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, the performance of which has not even begun, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be estimated only when they are accepted.
The expert council also proposed to transfer the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon, so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
Chairman of the expert council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this is not worth doing, as the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous reprisal of Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went to school again on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed during the territory recovering from the fighting.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and unrest to the settlements of southern Israel, affected by the rockets, but traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the kindergarten "Pashosh," in which the rocket hit, removed traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the arrival of students.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronitt Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she suddenly started going to school again "a little weird."
"It was a difficult time and we didn't leave our homes," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz, which is located near the border from Gaza to express his support.
Before the cease-fire had halted the war last week, thousands of border residents, such as the Sa'ad, did not go out or left their homes, leaving farther away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border from Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border from Gaza that she had long out of Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Gypto-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down their arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, of which three-quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it did not provide substantial evidence to support the claim.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines across Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fighting continued, the officials responsible for education, last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education, like children around the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The housing value index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for house prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are in a two-tier market.
The RP Data figures show that in Sydney, house prices rose 16.1 percent over the past year, while Melbourne's housing prices rose by 11.7 percent.
The next in capacity were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose from five to six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was through government cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring began, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high level of auction sales speed, overall high sales speed and current low-interest conditions, it's likely that the cost of housing will increase over the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold-producers and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Bolshaya Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century has not changed much since the time of construction, except for the dilapidation.
Extramenous people go here as on an excursion, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
The old yard, always the open door, the creaking staircase.
The doors in the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the lumen from the plaster of the plaster is visible in places the street.
Everything seems to be on an honest word.
And the locals say, "Do not think that's what it is."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatiana Lukyanov, a resident of apartment No 3.
The object is located on the state guard, but the money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poor, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many tenants still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions?
The road passes right under the windows, even there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pushes the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before that: under the windows is a stream of cars.
You see, the glass is constantly rattling, we can't open the windows, and we are used to the noise.
A man is accustomed to everything, to the good and the bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live with a threesome with our son.
And other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor there are ceilings in general a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit the neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: my husband and daughter and daughter with a handcuff.
I have been here from birth, another living space has never been," Lyudmila around the room with his eyes: mezzanine, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very closely and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water system is no suitable.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment routinely and surprisingly at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a backstage and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demidov lived with his family, on the second floor lived servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the real estate center, Ufa say that privatization does not matter.
Still, we will get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Already four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but the matter did not go beyond the promises.
I'm not used to complain and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, mother and dad, I and my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, heavier rats ran in the kitchen.
Look at the wing walls, they are meter thick!
They say the solution was implicated on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thanks to Demidov!
Probably, that's why no one has killed a collapsed ceiling or piles.
Only the building still slowly dies in front of our eyes: the boards and logs at home rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes to the ground, as in the well.
They say that it is - under our room a secret shelf and a move to the White River, which was specially made by the old man who lived here, so that you can hide from the danger, in which case.
They were being persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start an excavation in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give the living space in exchange for his one on the Avenue of October.
Lyudmila was denied the historian:
Where are we the foursome in one?
And here, at least a little hope is that they will give housing more spacious.
Agree to exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the family of the Old Man did not win anything.
The biggest dream of Lyudmila to be resettled, and their daughter with a 16-year-old hand-to-machine was given a separate room.
That is, two families were allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two cramp rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, there are two children.
You can see what conditions are.
Plaster falls off pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the spouses Lavrentiev's spouses were most fortunate from the apartment number 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
Room of 75 squares, prescribed three people.
We live just in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One thing is bad - everything around is cracking at the seams, falling apart, collapsing.
Neighbors must have already told us!
Most of the torment we have with the floors: wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went from under the feet.
I put backs, wedges; nothing else in the hall, and in the other room we walk, as we swing on the swings, so it's all pretentious.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The gold industry treats as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast guns and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of the ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house, but something prevented us.
The story was repeated in 2014: again lured new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, defused the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that the transfer to the apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all of this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
The residents did not accept the residents.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they gave a paper without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants."
I even have a feeling that our house has not been in the plan of the city for a long time, because first it was number 57, then it became 57, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had already been demolished in the 1970s.
"Russian planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the management on land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of settlement of dilapidated housing.
I can not be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, I only know that at that time there was a plan for the demolition of all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the ancient houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully carried out.
Residents are soon planned to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the re-establish of the House of Demidov will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016, all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
Houses will acquire the proper form corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to become a museum, open to everyone.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on weekends pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much congestion of roads in the city.
To resettle people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye due to a thunderstorm began a forest fire
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting area forestry in the Pozharsky district of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, there is an increase in the grouping of forces and means.
According to the management of the KGSBU "Primorskaya airbase," the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in an inaccessible area, was found by an observer pilot from the Ahn-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The remains of the old burner are burning.
Strong clutter of the territory and steep slope more than 45 degrees, the absence of landing paratroopers-fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft by the available airbase is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire at the site of extinguishing, 4 paratroopers-firefighters were quickly planted.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare a site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Okhotnychnyi helicopter additionally delivered 3 paratroopers-guards.
As soon as the landing site of the helicopter in the area of the fire will be ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lenny Henry: My father never huged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, "Rare Red Records of Rudy," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up from a series of radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of raggy and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some of the difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often meditates on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get off your sister.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a blow in cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper for most of my life.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although the conditions became better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what his life should have been.
Now there is a little better, but it is dark, smoky, depth of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father got into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate it more.
However, Henry came out of his childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never huged, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mother got sick at the very end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with French, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So, when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious phtens classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change of Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps in his noble, briefly trimmed beard.
Since he has been acclaimed by critics for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theater.
The "Mistakes Comedy" followed, followed by Auguste Wilson's Fences.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies, which were an inalienable attribute of his rich professional life.
He began his career when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ noticed how he paroded on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His television career began in the mid-seventies: "For a long time I was the only black parodist/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke-taking machine between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to "Black and White Manestle Show," an easy entertainment program in which people "browd face," Henry found that he was performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning lightweight entertainment classics on British television years and years" was a "grotesque parody of black people."
Introducing the characters who mocked the culture of blacks in the UK and sung by her, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of the Lenny Henry Show was aired in 1984, and in the nineties it was known as, among other things, chef Geret Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
The commercials, documentaries, television series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC show in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems like you're pulling time or slowly turning aside."
Then there was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
It's not that I'm really taught this at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class whites with pantyhose and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't yell at it until you know what you're talking about.
Pron aloud some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary broadcast, and he was hooked.
I feel like I can do that.
It's like my head's been straightened.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.
And she was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it did not happen.
Soon we started the "Mids Comedy."
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
A technical malfunction arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
That's not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You're playing in a play, you stay in the role."
Henry in "Fences" at the Dachess Theatre
Learning the text for "fences" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "That's what you need to do."
He says it, of course, with a voice.
So I hold on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the comedian's thinking - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he begins, then ends with a parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand-up, because this thing with an instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think it's quite dangerous.
If you're aiming for it all the time, it could lead to a stalemate.
I sometimes work in "Direct air in Apollo," when I want, but mostly I don't get the same pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give a stand-up to a tour someday.
The joy of sitting in the room with the director, who helps to give shape to the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give up it.
So that's his new incarnation?
Oh, I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place for that.
I love the stories.
People love the stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya began biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they left public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to cut corruption in state structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (700,000) per month went missing from payments to "invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The government suspects that wages continue to be in bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, said.
All civil servants must appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said.
Anyone who does not do this without a good reason will be erased from the payroll, it reports.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service, identifying the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government - hence put an end to the problem of "invisible workers," said Anne Weigur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structuring.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local news agencies reported.
Police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daly News.
Some of them participated last December in anti-corruption activities, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and tapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and the other in power by the Islamic clergyman Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told reporters waiting that not all schools have reopened, but that he will do everything he can to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held at every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally noted by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rhon Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs.
It is followed by a plume of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a high post at the head company Pearson's took up a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say that her earnings are approaching 1 million euros.
His political rating is also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, a former head of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory's adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of social life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two orientations: inward as the upper level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also as a voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which needs a complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming, trampling and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself deprives himself of work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, and many people would be happy to see how the BBC would shrink in size - after revising her powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the cost of the license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of $1450 per year, the British acquire a stake in the world's greatest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: she claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is obvious that the popularity of Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today against 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and use models have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it has found him.
Texas Perry says a humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
A tweet from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of a Democratic district attorney who is in the center of criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the record was disavowed.
A tweet that was written by someone by someone else's account was posted.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," the recording reports.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the messages asking them to comment.
Although the records were uploaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet caption reads: "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication, 3 times the permissible level of blood alcohol. But when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not investigate with the grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge the case to reject the indictment, saying that the law, which is used to prosecute a governor who performs his duties for the longest time in Texas, is vague, contrary to the constitution.
Perry halted $7.5 million in funding to the State's Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto caused an official complaint from a group of public control, which has leftist views.
The tape of the confirmed Perry account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Having arrived on the fifth at the party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could leave the game by publishing a tweet with a photo of himself running near the lake, and the words: "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of lively demand and rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Piggley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal levels of transactions since the peak of 2013, adding that this ensured a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market succeeded during the downturn, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent for one last year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes Berkeley rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching 423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan terms, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 percent based on the fact that the mood of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transactions, meanwhile, fell a quarter from the previous year in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital was very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales in the amount of 2.2 billion euros.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right product with a good design and the best location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales are still preserved for a period."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April - nearly a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual profit before taxes rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to 380 million euros, income - by 18 percent to EUR 1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Piggley said Berkeley's estimated revenues for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a profit for the whole year before the payment of taxes of 450 million euros is expected.
The stock price of Berkeley was on 23.96 euros in the afternoon on the London stock exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th American Film Academy Award ceremony.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Academy Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a "catalog" of photos of another 100 ascending stars.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and denounced the hacker for "the brazen invasion of personal space."
An appeal has been received to law enforcement, and they will be harassing anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, were allegedly due to a lack of Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of the victims of the hack includes the names of a dozen female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Katewal Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"Those who look at the photos that I took with my husband a few years ago, secluded at home, I hope you are proud of yourself," Winsted tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-Victory" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of the naked me FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the bud. *akalumb intentional *.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos, which, presumably, she is genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J," which sparked the praises of critics
They dissolved, it is best to say this, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard in communication, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability.
He was tweak like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this thorn was a little novel from which he had been waiting for more than usual to get rid of lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with loose hair and a terrifying heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsher than Port of Royce.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Querte considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in the damp, but similar to the paradise of the valley under the joyous name "Paradise Valley."
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, spiders sat still in the baths, slugs left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds, similar to giant cabbage kochans.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and enchanting, with a complete mystery of the garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the Long List of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist will be announced next week
Kever and Eileen sat, holding hands, in broken deckers among the high grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both pointed in the cheap console, which supplied the country with peaceful music and soothing news, when he looked at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of the long-forgotten black singer, who he loved his father.
You have too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They were not banned - nothing was banned - they just didn't lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
The public taste did what orders and prescriptions would never have been achieved, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich, who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, from all the music they chose ballads.
Fascinated by this afternoon, Kewern began to play the imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing the big legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically attaching two fingers to her.
That's how his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she flies off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth - and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't a fun game back then, and it wasn't a lot of fun now.
He knew that he was expected of it, that's all.
He told me what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although he was not openly banned.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There is only one place in life "if."
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was on people's nerves.
And jazz was a wit expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never hearing about Sammi Davis Younger, Kever knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the sphere of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The natives of Hindustan, as if by nature talented in everything that concerned electronics, took to ensure that no family could not remain without an electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was engaged in plumbing work; what remained of the Greek, beat the plates.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not begin to leave the country rapidly, when THAT PROFINISHED, IF YOUR PROFESSED rushed, in fear that they would be accused of inciting flames, in fear, in fact, that the flame would absorb them next, opened restaurants with labne and hookahs, did not stick out.
Everyone's ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult for Eileen to understand how the insulting words that Kevernev had just sang to her could be put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kebern said.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a single word could penetrate through the sound insulation of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he did not want to press two fingers to her again.
She thought it was strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head with a distrustful, closing the review to Kevern.
In the world there was nothing but the digging of her blue-black hair.
It's nothing he wants to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, staying with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
- You hate it?
I don't hate you, of course.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often brought him to awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could alleviate the cruelty that was joking.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kever, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eilinne Solomons blushed and got up from the chair, overturning the canal and strait of the wine they drank.
The wine from the elderberry, so the intoxication could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be trembling like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
I don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main features she looked like the local.
The same huge icy ocean hit them both.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after the time, WHAT MANUFUS, I don't need it than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, roamed from a pub to the pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman who dared to refuse them or to tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a dumb fist if she wasn't careful!
First, they would kiss - the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave - first to kiss her, and then to hit.
Excessive clarification, according to Keverer, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eilinne Solomons showed that he needed to leave.
He got up from the sunbed like an old man.
She felt the lead heaviness, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window watched him leave, her companion - a man who took on the burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his beefed, shamed, battled, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would see such a thing?
Again, one Eileinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or so Esme Nussbaum, a clever and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the "Ofnau," an informal public mood control service, has prepared a small report on maintaining a low and middle-level violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to shrink if not stopped at all, given the means and forces that were allocated for its eradication.
"A lot has been done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these entangled branches and narrow stratifications of the area, where, despite the churches hovering over the hedges, the gentle breath of human kindness was rarely felt in history.
However, some qualities are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it gives.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of obstacles and declares its ardent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and vicious idiots are emerging in the homes and playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said its supervisor, reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and laudable by themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
It is obvious that you are biased against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rude," others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To keep on what we have to do, IF YOUR PRODUCED, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country of life force necessary for it.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovitz was talking.
Behind his head is pink, like flamingos, LED letters repeated the tips that "Ofnau" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of the song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when I made sure that her supervisor had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we've been healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that initially led to the TOMU WHAT IS PROMOTED, I don't know how to do that.
Only this time we will throw away our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips in a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "causing "mistakes" the actions that our grandfathers committed or did not commit.
You go too far and when you say that they threw away their "wage" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "they."
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of mess, that's all we know.
For which, to be honest with themselves," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
It was then.
There's nothing more to say - we agree here.
And how not to blame anyone, you do not need to make excuses, if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovitz collapsed.
"I will consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was shot down by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in a vicious rage."
The coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says No Coup Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Representatives of Lesotho's army denied the coup preparation to overthrow the government, saying they acted against the police, who was suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had threatened an assassination attempt.
Army spokesman Major Ntlelei said there was no coup, in fact, but that the army responded to the threat from "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action, receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to arrange chaos," he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monjela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed the seizure of power by force, according to all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces currently have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of Lesotho's army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho is very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its combined government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite the accusations of the opposite.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan in Milan, according to Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he went on the field as part of the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier "Milan" rented from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest in 13 months
Eurozone production growth slowed to its lowest rate in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Eurozone manufacturing index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
The new orders were delayed, and the enterprises were affected among the growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to cope with the eurozone's recovery, as well as the threat of deflation in inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may later this week give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the UK and the United States during the financial crisis.
"While any growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level of 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy's weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that growth momentum faded mainly by the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to still be fueled by analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be introduced.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3 its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say is about the August study of the eurozone manufacturing sector business activity index, which shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially those associated with Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business - and especially consumer confidence, and likely leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said he said it was "more and more like that the ECB, in the end, will have to make some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will put a live chain against the militia
In Mariupol until last week, everything was calm - no one rushed to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are terrified to see the arrival of the "militia."
According to political scientists, the separatists break through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but its forces are a little against the armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten Years of Ada for survivors of Beslan: Ten years with the eerie capture of the school, like the children who find themselves in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom are children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
Exactly ten years after the horrific capture of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children who heroically survived the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like a critical degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in disgust, which in an amazing way then grew into action and hope for the future in the conditions of the heaviest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Besslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We have found amazing young people who have confronted the trouble, although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which the same children as they die, will now stop.
The girl who in the photo is trying to climb back into the stoned sports hall
It is captured in the photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear she tried to climb back to the stoned sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In the confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run with all her might, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and got back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but she said yesterday, "Three months ago the pain was back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn't broken it," she says.
"It happened to me and that fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapova, was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed that we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says the capture remains with her, although the memories are a little dim every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and from everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I climb into the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that this doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw the crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got free and was in the hospital with wounds on his legs, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe that.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now a non-existent News of the World) where he was awarded as a Children's Defender to Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I'd like me to stop remembering him," he said.
I can say that I have a dim in my mind.
I remember when I threw away all my toy weapon.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy shop where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and a trip in an open top car.
But now he is afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I'd like to be able to stop remembering him.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at the convent.
I want to help you.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope I'll be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our quarter, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the capture, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I was telling our story.
I realized then that people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with the waitresses in a restaurant, Damir was shooting them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world hasn't been better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is 17, he's taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can't believe it's been so sure I was so sure I was dead for a few hours and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when parts of the body were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
Life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: survivor Beslan Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and on the right George today
On his bloody face was the imprint of fear when he was saved from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of study before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly the only one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falls into the soul: the photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking shots of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so much wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the weeping George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this photo, and it's hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is coming to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to be decades to forget her a little.
She affected my health, and I still feel it.
I had nightmares for about three or four years because of the capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every 1st September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'll be studying to be a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military, but I didn't get my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
George Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events - I have to say that it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was in this famous photo.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital open on a laptop open on the hospital after the capture
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that has been damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they need to survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It's worse in my soul when the anniversary is coming.
I'll go and be present at the ceremonies to be held to mark it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it should be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan the imprint lies on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something's so terribly unfair, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but can't do sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have made to me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are now at war?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed a lot.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, it's as far as you can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
The infant, who was touchingly carried away in a safe place fighter of special forces
Saved: Alena Tskayev brings to a safe place a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she is ten (on the right), and she does not remember the monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was taken out of the captured school in Beslan, a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and Mahar's brother in the school's gym.
The Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Aleny's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing of the capture and bloomed in a smart and cheerful girl, the neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a magnificent father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, said he was looking forward to being able to re-enter the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will again play for "Borussia," - quotes Bild Kagawa.
I feel very good.
I am full of positive emotions and I look forward to again being able to enter the field in the form of "Borussia."
Recall that Kagawa moved to the "MU" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he could not gain a foothold in the English club, having spent in two seasons only 38 matches in the championship of England, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
The man accused of hitting a girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife
The 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot down a girl at a crossing in Pittenvin in East Newk.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart led his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and knocked down the girl, resulting in a traumat.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, set a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be in Vladivostok
The duty-free trade store of the Duty Free airport of Vladivostok posted a plaque prohibiting shopping in this store by a number of world political leaders.
Do not turn them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to find vodka, cognac and perfumes in their store.
And I hung on the door a sign.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance of an institution - Dietary canteens of Moscow State University, which was reported by the site of catering establishments.
Whether the American president's dream ever eat in a diet canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese-in-laws in demand.
The board was given during a visit to the company "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex."
The head of government also gave the council to the restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of focused preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All sport" words Maslakov.
Third place is the confirmation of our high level.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans above us is minimal.
Keep in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not obliged our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the national team.
The French, on the contrary, have put up a capable team, which includes 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have been publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not oppose the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were an order of magnitude lower than on the same "Diamond League."
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is not so important to athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it reached the absurd, when at 1500 meters the men were so fond of tactical intricacies running that they showed a score below the average level. women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve better quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot video underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "soap nit," such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoProPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on the family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you'll be shooting.
Some photo and video cameras have shooting modes or type of object that optimize the exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer's management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots because many of them won't.
"soaps" have a housing and communal dwelling that will help you to compose pictures, while the action cameras usually do not have them.
Even if you have a LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So do a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots several frames with slightly different exposition installations, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the way you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off in a basin, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more colors in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Come closer to the objects of the shooting.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
It is especially important if you shoot on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the subjects of the shooting if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling Bilal Makhov can go to Greco-Roman fight.
This was reported by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan in freestyle wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is at the assembly of the team of "classicists," - quotes "R-Sport" words of Sajid Sazhidov.
In general, in juniors Biljall performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the tournament of the volatiles and the third winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There have long been talk that a new stage of our career will be held in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Makhov can perform already at the World Cup in Tashkent - if he wins the outfit.
But the decisive word is always for the coaching staff headed by Goga Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose power of personality could shake everything around, even in a gigantic organization like the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist counseling, he devoted his career to delivering patients from both the suffering of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, recalls his wife, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors were passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those who are being treated are mainly worried about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found that he was irritating his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and incomprehensible why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked a colleague to do an x-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier he skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are here.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects plerough, or lung shell.
For most crayfish, it's hard to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma differently.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, fibrous building material, which was once called a "miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can not be addressed.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommendatory industrial ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with him: pipe-isolators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and the projected number of future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly consequences now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have been ultimately banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, embedded in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The vastions of selectivity, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, is not salvation.
The building of the Parliament is permeated with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe-isolist.
In fact, he had to think where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Gaia hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who had been trained in the Gay hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010.
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Living for so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get sick with the same disease?"
According to a leading mesothelioma expert in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in Britain should outlive itself, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people now don't know they'll die that way.

Quickly viewing reports from the courtrooms, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen had been in contact with asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before that happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have thought it would hurt me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestistform," which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of damage to health" that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are strong, albeit indirect grounds to believe that this is the main cause of exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."

Janis Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "the significant percentage of mesotheliome when there is no known effect on work or at home were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to the "ordinary use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of the parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as "strong airflows."
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the House of Maintenances insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean health certificate," it has now recognized that it is necessary to carry out work on the reconstruction of the parliament, improving the electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election of 2015, members of parliament may be sitting in the QE2 conference center nearby, not on the green bench.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not governed by various rules."
It is impossible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that has been successfully filed lawsuits related to asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where they worked and the dates.
What he remembers is clearly the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I started to feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janece Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He could not go to work for a month.
The puzzling doctors took x-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it for tests.
His condition was not diagnosed.
His health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was engaged in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his foster care with similar symptoms, and was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma."
However, even then Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who advised him showed his CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was inserted into the cavity between his chest and his lung shell.
I am an optimist.
I usually go on," he says.
I wasn't worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott plunged into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom offered him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the size of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos thermal insulation on the pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now affected by the disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-emitted pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly actually exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the students, but a place that posed a threat to life to the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their burners of Bunsen on asbestos stands
It's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were most likely to be exposed to asbestos in the class for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren set their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
There were websites that highlighted the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of sheds tended to contain asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when carrying garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
"It takes a long time to realize it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in surgery.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the patient's position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he was misguided by the amount of information that had to be taken.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life - the act of breathing itself - that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in a plerough, a lung shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the hybe and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed while internship at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treger, "breathing is pushed out to the periphery, where the shell is located.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes heated controversy.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treasurer disagrees.
"You can't cut the plevra," he says.
You can't get a knife around her.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well amenable to chemotherapy," which "acts," but does not cure.
"Once the time, there are patients who live long," says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Steven Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lowson, who, four years after diagnosis, became a support office and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energy.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "had managed to give everything a somewhat more positive coloring."
Having met several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazundunki, professor of thoracic surgery at the Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them and they took me," Graham said.
The average patient would have to receive referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best available treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - about the future of families they will leave.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos have been bad for health since 1898," Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the company's bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," Morgan said, as Lawson failed to prove unambiguously that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gaia Hospital.
After investigating his death, the hospital's representative, Gaia, nevertheless, confirmed that "the asbestos in the basement in the basement they were talking were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, which require compensation.
Many of their former employers changed their owners or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from the lawsuits know that on their side the time, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not.
In response, serious new legislative acts were issued this year, which make it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the law, a $350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount the court could award in a normal case of compensation - about 120,000 euros.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that 350 million euros is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time interval had not intervened and the patients with the mesothelioma could track the companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the labor and pension minister, admitted that the law was "imperfect."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, a quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of the Mesotheliome Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loik Lange-Lazundinski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lrange-Lazundunki recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - three therapy, in which Lange-Lazdunski boasts as many as 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"It's one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You can see it in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans did not show a trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There is no trace of tumours.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or what to show your wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become bleak.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, is not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was diagnosed the first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to see you.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all of her friends, and we were very quickly called by many.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the opportunity to survive.
This disease carries with it (even as it is ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissue.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.

During World War II, shipbuilding is developing intensively, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Blue Asbestos Imports
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health hazard lawsuit caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
World asbestos production grows to more than 4213000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The UK's Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires that all asbestos contractors obtain a license.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
The compensation of 350 million euros has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is kept at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters will swear to take revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to mark the start of the long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing in a matter of hours after this statement.
The decision of the National People's Congress, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't defraud our expectations, but it's furious," said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party's president.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the national nomination of the leader of Hong Kong would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to choose by vote the head of government, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders unveiled the decision as a democratic step forward on Sunday, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process tightly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely received wide-ranging protests in Hong Kong over the years.
Behind much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with government agencies.
In the online statement, the organizers reported that the movement "was thinking about the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very pleased to announce that all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
State authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricades were strengthened at the government headquarters on Sunday.
The riots are based on the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are putting at risk a business - a source of life force in Hong Kong.
"The protest they're talking about can cause much economic damage depending on how many people will be involved and how long," said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a message that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown by saboteurs sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on suffrage, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American culture of graduation balls reaches university life: freshmen were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a bright impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to take their belongings across the country in a dangerously congested car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students get to the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
The company's representative said that since this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students should be required to pay for training 9,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what you need to do.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants does not keep up with the rapidly growing spending on basic needs, before they can start thinking about taking thousands of pounds out for something like a simple arrival in the hostel.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police conduct after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, linked to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoel Peres noticed a shift in an internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest increased and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the assassination of August 9, a personal essay with headlines such as "flemishness about Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are a lot of people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis that we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to race, they felt that it should be pointed out.
For an English professor at Ohio University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson has exposed the problems that black Americans face every day but who are not perceived as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence stuns.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now share issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
We needed a white woman confirming the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," said Hattery.
A look back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against the Lungarian Women's Association for the Prevention of Lveverage.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminists" reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" the problems that black women have handled in several generations.
"Truly, it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they treat the right to contraception?"
The second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what it means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by the Guardian's Calebca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger in the body - and the point of view on the racial problems that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the head of change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem vouchs for a more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments about the race in America still surprise some.
Researcher at the American Entrepreneurial Institute Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, "much are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she expressed earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "The Watcher to My Brother" to help the vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, angerous reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that promotes the advanced line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform has re-emermed - this time as a woman's problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women in order to present this problem as an important problem.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to immigrant men], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house "with pigs" for sale
A photo of the house for sale in Saffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for 120000, a single-mile house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed," the company's spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique one-bedroom house."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open lost to Caroline Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to adequately end the year and try to reach a new level, reports from New York Vasily ISIPOV.
How do you generally assess your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially in the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarter-finals.
What tasks do you set for yourself before the end of the season?
After the insulting defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuyev proposed for the implementation of the norms of the GTO to give bonuses when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for tightening, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement the norms of the GTO on September 1 on their territory.
I also offered schoolchildren who passed the GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, they can add a little points to the exam.
There are also proposals to give additional weekend to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
The player in the Harvey lottery this month.
A new millionaire is being searched in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the draw of the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.

The owner of the shop Steve Forward said that the winnings caused a hype in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be a secret.
The eight Western Australian winners celebrated winning the main prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table, which was held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas engine fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (there is a copy of the "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme for preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of machines, stimulating localization and creation of service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015 It is planned to make changes to the regulations in order to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking lots, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to hold in 2015. formulate proposals for regional authorities that they also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with benefits when driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016. - and proposals for the expansion of public procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development is already by October 2014. will include in the list of indicators of assessment of the activities of regional authorities, the criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric cars in Russia is only being formed - in 2013. About 100 electric vehicles have been sold in the country.
In the early 2014. zeroed import duty on electric cars, so sales will amount to about 500 units, predicts chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013. In Russia, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million passenger and light commercial vehicles have been sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Start imports are prepared by Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says the director of strategic planning and partnerships Renault in Russia Nicolas Remiz.
Most other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see position in relation to Russia.
There are also developments of electric vehicles in Russian manufacturers - "," GAZ, ," but the release is minuscule.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ACM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" in engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, is twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (refuelling units), the general director of "AUTOSTAT" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rates of lower cost of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Avtorev Mikhail Podrozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to inspire confidence in consumers that "electricity" is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a gas station network are also being conducted with other regions.
According to the director of the department of "Rosseti" Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build refueling throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a grid company do not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the opportunity to do this in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankiv considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia, the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, according to Pankow.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cuts led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentive measures are needed for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankow, or the possibility of moving electric cars on the allocated lanes, which is not yet in Russia.
A private jet crashed in Colorado
A single-engine aircraft Piper PA-46 crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, they are dealing with the prisoners of the Donbass battalion.
Punishers were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really is, they would not go to war.
The 108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat grinders" in which they fell near Ilovaisk.
In the encirclement of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that you can get out of the "ring" on the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally in a couple of minutes, shells and bullets were whistling from all sides.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," he said. deputy battalion commander with the call sign "Lermontov."
And when we descended into the lowland between the Multopol and Chervonoselsky, crossfire began from anti-tank guided missiles, with "zokes," 30mm grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three behind me, in the end, there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now being provided with medical care by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to a certain death.
We were betrayed, they say.
Column, whole battalion to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass," as well as many of his comrades, Alexey acted as a volunteer, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly repaired in the south-east "separatists."
Now Alexis saw a completely different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed - not someone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, said that there was a mortar shelling, that most likely they were the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said that we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from the training camp with Zurakhovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, a 300-350 man was stuck in the "cauldron" near Ilovaisk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have entered the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over to the security forces of the DPR.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a headquarters was established to limit the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk region, a headquarters has been created, which, if necessary, will limit the growth in prices for products in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory authorities.
Together, they will monitor the prices for agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev "Rosneft" reimburse $ 140 million in losses?
The head of "Rosneft" Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichino refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the company, the Lisichansk refinery was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fights, there were no "co-rayed rebels," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial object.
In addition, technological oil has disappeared, pumped into the pipes," he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichany refinery, a tank for storing oil and destroyed the buildings of two warehouses.
Lisichansk refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the standard "Euro-4," as well as batch of diesel fuel standard "Euro-5."
In March 2012 oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairs at the company.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk Refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range shell in the direction of the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chaganda, which is located on the border of North Korea and China.
As told "Interfax" in the Joint Committee of chiefs of staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble falls against the backdrop of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow stock exchange, the dollar grew at the opening by 3 cops. up to 37.15 rubles, the ruble fell to the bi-currency basket against the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trades on the ETC on the dollar started with transactions within the boundaries of 37,11-37,2 rubles/$1, on average, for two minutes, the exchange rate was fixed at 37.16 rubles/$1, this is 4 kopecks. above the previous closing level.

The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The U.S. dollar is traded for 23 cops. above the official rate, the euro - by 16 kopecks. above the official course.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but panic was not observed this time.
He continued to become cheaper and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing back the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia in advance.
However, so far it is more like artificial hysteria, bloated through the media, especially the Western.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
At the opening of the Moscow exchange, the ruble continues a sharp weakening against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, and the Russian indices, and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.

Twitter has become more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the process of registering users to quickly involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogging.
Now, new Twitter users will be viewing during the registration a large number of recommended accounts with the service to immediately make their reading.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration of interests.
At the same time, Twitter automatically checks a subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to personally remove the checkboxes, so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only the avatars of recommended users, now Twitter is displaying a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help make an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is primarily associated with the continued attempts of the service to achieve breakeven.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a drop in reader activity.
The company is currently in desperate need of more consumers loyal to the resource, who, once in time, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising tools.

As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo car.
Previously, there was already a similar program of car recycling in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is planned not only to dispose of machines to receive a subsequent discount, but also the possibility if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one at a discount when handing over the old one in the "trade-in" from the dealer, Interfax reports.
The previous federal recycling program, which was in force from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, more than 16 billion rubles were spent.
Due to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact became widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are now underway, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in the areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters - bandits, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where the average person can not go.
If he covers the events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The glasses in the game will need to be dialed with the help of a hero's Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photo about it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been condolringuming the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to the protests in the United States, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heleteys draws Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Heletey is drawing the people in the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
"In Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who announced the "completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War," the losses in which will be calculated by "tens of thousands."
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page, the mentioned post, is a subject for the study of specialists not in the military field," - stated in the message of the Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of the civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has threatened several times that if they continue to resist, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that "the operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" was completed.

Prison officials of Bulgaria held a national protest rally
Hundreds of prison employees from all over Bulgaria held a national protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to return the previous working conditions that had recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayuth (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defense Ruthew Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prutiut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military officer who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for the post of prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of the Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of the parliament.
According to Prayuta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of complete paralysis of the civilian authorities.
The leaders of the main political parties were arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army removed his brother Yinglyk Shinawat Thaksin as prime minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many middle-class and the capital's elite entered the anti-government movement, which has been paralyzing the country since November 2013.
No one said that in the salad mussels will be better, I did not promise you this, the waitress from the new Palm brasssekah.
It is necessary to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain abrupt.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean the mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium."
Restaurateurs like to deeply declare that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are places that are not that well, but even fine, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at a Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "City" (in honor of the same TV program), then "Odessa-mother," and also the restaurant "Beaujolais" and beer "Friendship."
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground is located only the tip of the iceberg: a bar counter and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful high chairs, instead of windows - TVs where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have not been new, so to compare there is something to compare.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The companei-positive waitress cheerfully present the menu, telling that "the mussels are hearty big seeds," and it should be noted: the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, for example, it is allowed to predict that meat roll with Vallonian prunes (280 rubles) - in fact, carpaccio, sliced to the same as thinly, that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly thick matter.
You can feel at least some taste, if you warm up once half a tarkel.
The case is even worse with salads.
The classic Liege (260) would be the most correct to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some chewing iceberg, boiled once a long time ago potatoes, the sparselyst Kenyan beans, wooded chips from bacon plus some marinated onions.
With such a Liege salad, you will not want to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not positive.
If cherry tormented quarters or roasted mushrooms could still close their eyes, then why mussels look as if they had been defrosted and boiled in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pans "in the sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sauces are half a dozen, the one that is of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not set.
There are flowers, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, so it remained a mystery.
But good mussels with homemade majuni.
Chicken water here is not a bread, thick to such an extent that, depending on the mood, you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit is a local cook in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemill.
The situation was diametrically opposite: the rosemary drowned everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his lifetime was fed exclusively by rosemary bushes, which is why the meat acquired such an extraordinary aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful rabbit was attached to the leg - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
The Palm waffles are offered not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was an overly watery man, and the waffles are dry.
But the manager approached the table very informally inquired about the lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar rose on the MICEMB above 37 rubles on the news about the new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculations "tomorrow" to 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The buoyancy basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, and paired with the euro, and in pair with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst of "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will in one way or another affect the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, the rumours about the invasion of the troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market was very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were crossed out.
The week, according to the forecasts of the specialist, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, the oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in one chain.
The acceleration of inflation is also predicted: to the current prices for autumn will be increased from 5 to 10%.
Soon, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be some vacuum while the networks refocus on other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria," - commented the head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, he said, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went the news on Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year completely switched to the floating exchange rate and abandons any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daytime fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Were alarming times for the foreign exchange market, I remind you when at the end of January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in the cost of imports, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
To the negative points can be attributed to the rise in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressures and, as a result, become the reason for the increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX index in the course of trading on Thursday decreased by 1.67%, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative decrease in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go to naught, and the ruble quotes partially or completely restore the lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - said Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disturbance is often misdiagnosed
The British said she spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Carine Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Tut disease (ShMT), a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
Charitable organization CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis is a frequent problem among people with the CMT, because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have a SMT that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, insecure gait, and toes.
Patients can feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's (AF) ataxia, a condition for which was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, who is now 51, said: "As a child, I knew that I can't do what others can do.
I fell every day, and I took more time.
I could never ride rollers or skateboards with other kids, and I was kidding a lot at school because I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten the feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written there that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose out where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about that state in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic that was possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that gap.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you're sick because you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much lesser threat to life.
After several genetic examinations, she was found by SMT.
"When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The charitable organization of the UK has announced a month of information about the SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington zone entrepreneurs is growing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Tax bills for the state and local levels for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington zone - no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid a total of $27.6 billion to the state treasury and locally in the fiscal year 2013, 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on the state and local businesses increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after years that went through each other, when accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.
The tax levied by the state grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 percent, comes from taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenues come from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the growth in tax revenues is caused by a return to the previous level of real estate prices of companies, the researchers say that raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large share of these revenues are from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same thing is happening in the Washington zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia have paid $10 billion in real estate taxes by state and local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent, compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate costs has no similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by the state and at the local level in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the company's tax accounts.
The companies of Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the tax accounts in the state and at the local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, such as income taxes, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent growth of tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
The revenues of entrepreneurs also seem to be improving, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income tax, the most in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 percent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Only in Virginia there was a rise in tax revenues below average, equal to 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia's taxes are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a legislation cutting the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington zone seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local levels, according to a recent study.
The Entrepreneurial Taxes paid as individual income tax by small business owners are the transitional structure that most small firms are based - in District Columbia, Maryland and Virginia up to $2.4 billion last year, with a much faster growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
The researchers say the trend and increase in revenues from business taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenues in turnover tax in state and local governments, which grew by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world judo championship brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the same final fight against Boldbaatir, Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion 2011 and 2013 to the Japanese Masaisi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarter-final stage, won the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze medal.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also to the third step of the pedestal of honor reached Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion Mylinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title at this championship.
In the dispute for the bronze Kuzyutina won Ma Yinan from China, but after the end of the tournament still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze in the piggy bank of the Russian national team was put by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, his offender was a former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a pause in the competition.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who took UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the World Cup-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he due to the remark of the opponent defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played out at the tournament at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
Its winner was Kirill Questions, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the comforting final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent Questionov could not reach the tatami due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the piggy bank of the team by Renat Saidov, who played in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
So ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were one of the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was unlucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judoka won the team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a stubborn fight with the score of 2-3 lost the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and volition - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, developed to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," Putin said.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestor of judo - there is nothing wrong with the shame here.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then in the asset of the Russian team there were only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We are all big maximalists.
I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the top eight, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo," summed up the tournament Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, the words of which is quoted by the press service of the championship.
The national team of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held in Astana in the summer.

The family of Joan Rivers hopes for the best
Joan Rivers is unconscious from arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, according to sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy."
The response was widespread, including numerous online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Reap.
All can be kings.
On sale is the debut album of the group Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duo from clubs straight to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is only a year on stage, but already has an asset nomination for a BBC music award, a tour to the opening of the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut eponymous album a few months before the release received 100 thousand. pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the out there, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet voice of the "new R'n'B," but about the duo of bulls in the eyes of the British, playing with the level of volume and intensity, which was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, bets on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
The duo did not take a name to itself, which before that could envy only desperate hairy metallers, and the blood of which kings flows, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
We are talking, of course, primarily about the heroes of the previous level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to a new height.
Making predictions about the success of this enterprise is probably too early, but you can already say something.
A dozen songs that fit in thirty minutes with a small minute is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characteristic of what is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to knock than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing album of the song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of lovers of heavy rock, but when playing in a row, they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The power of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather to mark the successors of Motirhead), but brought out numerous rock duoets from the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obvious that it is cramped.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about instruments, but also in the very approach to composing songs.
Heroes of the zero retrok with great difficulty were chosen beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already now sound so powerful and brazen that this pressure successfully drapes some secondary and stubbornness of musical material.
And in the end, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store - both a video producer and a hundred other things - is buying Twitch's streaming video playback service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general streaming service - a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which all-knowledge gives (mainly old) the game processing, as in the "Mystery Theater," is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often when described by Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without much interest, a classic example of a entrenched technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that it was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, to be honest, is Twitch's incredible success.
Snobs like me, who say that they will be better at sports than watching it, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick yourself.
It's one thing to look over a friend at 3 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and it's quite another to watch an outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them shooting without controlling the angle of view on their own, can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passages in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time entertain.
But if we're not talking about the game's virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will fold in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to get: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shire, Amazon and Twitch, "both believe in the future of the games," and this channel does not show signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the victims, with the cemetery keeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudyeva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the Department of "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on a special project.
Having returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President for the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the command officer "B" of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What shocked me especially during my work on this topic is that in Beslan as if it were not these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has at least some relation to it, people have difficulty agreeing to talk about what happened.
The experiences of the trip are very difficult.
But you can not forget Beslan, and I hope, we coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the studio of the infographics of the Rambler & Co holding, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, according to Renhap.
The launch was carried out around 10.30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma introduced a draft law providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the database of legislative activities of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevhen Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more prompt and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of parliamentarians rushs, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of the court's decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called "black lists" of sites-violators - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects."
This law was adopted by the state Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation, will have to pay for the lease
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on information policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "Rostelecom, who has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers and already provide their servers, from the Mail Group, from Western companies that already provide their servers."
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will get technological opportunities for placement," Levin concluded.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, the Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determine that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose on which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.

The militias handed over to the Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
The "Army of Novorossiya" claim that shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
The militia as of 10:00 on September 1 handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of which were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya."
He added that "air defense forces in the area of the village of Mereshki shot down a Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side during the artillery shelling of the Lugansk airport used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The loss in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 people," - said the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossiya," "precede an attempt by the national guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the encirclement."
Then the militia reported the destruction in a fleeting battle of two tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on condition that the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of servicemen began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semyon Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday, 14 more people left the "boiler."
On his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captive by 137 regiments of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigade of the Russian Federation," where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied the reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in the event of the introduction of the EU of new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Diplomatic Office said that the "conclusions" of the European Council on August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of the reckless support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing parties," the ministry said.
It is also noted that now there are no lens assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, as well as the number of civilian casualties.
Recall that during the next seven-day in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
It is expected that they will correlate among themselves the measures introduced for the period of action and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Severe ways to save money on university textbooks
Despite the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon go to the second course, came up with a cunning way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from undergraduates, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and "Chick-fil-A" cookies," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to Schroeder's system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
The company "Nibo Incorporated," which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented, says Vice President of Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores."
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of the one you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hestetler costs about $290 in the price list, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of second-hand
If you are not against other people's marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49 in second-hand form at Chegg.com.
Matt Caseda, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a second copy of the "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracies, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, invites students to clarify to their professors whether they can not use previous editions.
Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, the old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the sites Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by "eBay Inc.," is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Car rental
You should think about getting textbooks for rent, if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that you can write out for notes, underlines and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, fines can even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks - another option.
Sometimes such books are rented, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Rent "Mathematical analysis" on the website Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracie says that students studying literature can often find the most favorable prices, since many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on the natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Galt, 29, who is going to start studying at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the book's prices, as this ensures that you're looking for the text you need.
Before you make an order on the Internet, says Galt, be sure to check whether the book is really in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the ineffectiveness of the Fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin took at a meeting on the state support of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," - said the President.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, until July 1 did not approve the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive with key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region.
We will remind, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" could not save the cash collections
Sylvester Stallone's "Issibles 3" returned less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "The City of Sins: The Woman Who Should Kill" only returned $12 million from his $70 million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappoint revenue.
The article of the film critic of the Telegraph Robbie Collin indicates that when it comes to children's films, it may be a bad quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of history in terms of children's films, and called "How to tame a dragon 2" barely a "functioning" sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a somewhat older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film, released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the holiday of Remembrance Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of this year's films are similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing spectator habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-release Disney film "The Jungle Book," told the website of the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing.
We have to admit it and not try to chase for what it was before.
Unlike the current drop in box office fees in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the figure of $837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted the "crashes" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there was some truth in his grim predictions.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015, several potential box office hits are expected to be released, including "Aveter: The Ages of Ultron," "Minions" and "Yursky Park," other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
"Law X" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in box office fees "cyclical," saying, "The next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the catering so far prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's a better little-salted cucumber than a bad mozzarella," the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio lamented about the quality of the cheeses offered to him in return for Italian.
Mozzarella and burrat cheese ended in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan stocks should be enough for another couple of months.
What should I do?
Go to the Russian?
In 2005 I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that is clear: shocking memories do not let him go.
The meek there was on the trolleys just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's a cat!
The chisses!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed there now.
But the other day I was brought to the sample of fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be rotto!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought us that.
Valerio is surprised that many common things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the outlandish.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be sagged to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such a gentle meat?"
I said, so it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which shows missing products: French oysters, sea hedgehog.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the Strelka bar, Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will be bought by Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis it is worth so much?"
They say, "We have to make money too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy distant oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, imagine how much their shell weighs?
At a price, it's a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
The first three months were all right, and the quality fell sharply.
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants of European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese are over

Sanction menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
In the country it is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants began to chechard with suppliers: food prices have increased, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
The strongest will affect expensive restaurants with monokuches in France, Italy, Spain, in which products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The cat must have been rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer-2014 were much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which are withdrawing from the ban the fry of Atlantic salmon and tranipom, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions may still be relaxed.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, restaurateur, owner of the agency "Restconsult."
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to abandon 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine are already beginning to replace dishes, for example, a steak of marbled beef - for beefstrogannes, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," - lists the representative of the company "East-West" Oksana Glibchuk.
The cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rebuild than to the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets went there, able to distinguish the Italian mozzarella from the Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the establishments of the Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time for replacement," Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European
But a lot of restaurants, which the sanctions will not affect.
These include establishments with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbaia, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vay Me!"
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillets, we do not use exotic greens."
In the establishments of Kolbai have not yet been removed from the menu of any dishes.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chaykhon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions are also not embarrassing: he will have to change only the lamb to the New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe," he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows that they are tasty, sweet.
Nobody's talking about Spanish that.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimba Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the "Money" request, also quite calmly respond to sanctions.
McDonald's press service said the localization exceeded 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80% of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctions products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
They did not affect the sanctions and the Vokker noodles.
KFC, Burger King and "Kroka Potato" did not respond to the "Money" request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than the Russian Far East
On his humph
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are growing even for local products.
"On products for "Grables" prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Berry Mio" - twice," - says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will grow by 5-10%, Kolbaia admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products from the beginning of August rose by 10-15%."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergey Rak, deputy general director of Strardogs.
The chicken shirt rose by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, the "Stardogs" will be a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: while most restaurateurs stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the mayor's office of Moscow there are a dozen tents, decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the scene, the musicians play a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the fun name "There is time to eat."
"We were going to make a celebration of local food for a long time, and then just the sanctions, we rushed, organized the festival," - says one of the organizers.
Behind the scenes with the musicians, the chefs-Greek Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade candies, the other day there was a master class on cooking borchet with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Moscow "Lenin Sovkhoz," cheeses from the rusted Italian Jay Klouse.
"Looss with restaurants can be safely replaced with other salmon fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish shop "My people" Philip Galkin.
We catch a ham, a ketah, a cest, a humpback, a chavy - "royal salmon."
Yes, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it's wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands, he doesn't even move.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent lie shrimp with the tag "Magadan," cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand. The tons.
The store "Your people" has been working since 2012, sells fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things."
Now Galkin received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, - he is hot.
We got sick, we tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation in the Tent of Galkin, I are preparing a portion of "Philadelphia" with a ketah.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to chew longer, but the consciousness that this fish is our domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls of halibut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, they prefer Chilean to replace Norwegian salmon.
Galkin explains this by the fact that the chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"We have not been offered Russian fish suppliers yet," says Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev.
The situation is about the same with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy a vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily large producers of other countries," - says Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
According to the results of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the speedy opening of restaurants for visitors," - said the "Dengam" in the press service of McDonald's.
In fact, no one knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on condition of anonymity employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald's is closed across the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the traffic police
Payments on the casco can be received without a certificate of traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions, according to which from September 1 of this year to receive payments on the casco, the insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
We are talking, however, only about those cases when the accident was issued according to the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars participated in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached agreement on the issue of who is the culprit of the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments on the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand. from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand. The rub.
The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued by "Europrotocol," drivers who got into an accident, cause traffic police.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was impossible to receive compensation for it without a certificate of traffic police.
The parameters prescribed in the draft instructions are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the "Europrototocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for the casco in connection with the accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit on the "Europrotocol."
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the casco insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to unload both traffic police officers and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of growth in fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules for payments on the casco.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome the primordial Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will wait for the inspector for hours to arrange a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol."
Savings certificate will make name and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates for bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, because it is not necessary to make deductions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The spicyness of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to DIA, control 98% of the profile market.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the DIA, is that the customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his licenses are trying to get money in the DIA.
Some depositors, without sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for the bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when bearer certificates holders tried to recover insurance indemnity through the court," the DIA said.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay buyers certificates, since they do not have the right to reimburse from the state by law.
If the case was that the instrument was not insured in the DIA, along with it would be banned and metal bills, in which citizens' funds are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one has yet to enemens.
The case is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-side.
At the same time, their movement is practically not subject to control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before cashing, such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill prescribes that a savings certificate should be a personal security that must be stored in the depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to issue without the right to early repayment.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable contribution is introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: The first protests in Nymport and Cardiff
On the weekend, protests were held against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff Town Hall for what was described as an anti-sammit.
Stephen Faircklau followed the developments over the weekend and talked to the protesters who came from all over the world, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the terrorist group "Islamic state," reports August 31, ITAR-TASS, citing a decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the government of Germany led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8 thousand. assault rifles G3 and G36.
Deliveries will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will make a statement in the Bundestag on this topic.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the "hot spots."
The opinions of the residents of the Federal Republic of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that only in this way it is possible to stop fighters from the "Islamic state," others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia shot down Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, according to August 31, ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymbriez (10-20 km to the east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is clarified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two Bushouoker teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday in Gottts Lip in Blackhait.
Concerned relatives called the police at around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search crew was sent, which included local police and rescue squad, and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near Brightal Weil Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the win on Monday morning.
They were taken away in an ambulance in a stable condition at Blue Mountains Hospital.
Meet two unions
Negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Although the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot problems" for the first time.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this matter fell off on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them, other Eurasians and Europeans saw in the TV news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of honed courtesy, it was the behavior of a person who had just hit the jackpot - and plans a worthy old age in high society.
How the Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissars (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just legitimizing the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure: from now on, Brussels will not be able to talk with Minsk as much as before.
"The fact that Katherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to deflect," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for a breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"The results were achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization," - lists the interlocutor of "Fire," - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The U.S. even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed a balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and evaluated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful will be the movement of Lukashenko to political diversification, it will be seen how often in the near future Minsk will be able to receive meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton could not quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in a new format.
A spokeswoman Ashton Maya Kocijancic only told the "Fire" that against the background of the resolution of issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he, it turns out, was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remained a central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OS-OS-Ukraine format, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" acquires the status of a quite hands-on European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
Best Friend of European Farmer
Already, the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion that the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the planned schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the CU countries under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like a achievement of larger than peace declarations without specific dates and numbers.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, said that EU officials "came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine "works" for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, the long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Research Center Mises, former candidate for president of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products in the Russian Federation bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin cherished Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk stressed "Ogonku," - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have been working out the schemes for the supply of goods for a long time, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is due to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not mind to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $ 4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the site for the negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Eurofarers.
This can raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Katherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the CU+EC format is being rediscovered, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev became the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any bulk to discuss, not from the bay-barakhta to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that at that time was developing in Ukraine," he said in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, it was rumored to initially oppose the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus in the organization of cooperation between the EU and the CU on its land does not pursue vested goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation in the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, put forward and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," - said "Fire" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where recently scrupulously selecting words.
In Moscow may appear zones with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will see all the disadvantages and pros.
To say that some decisions have been made on this issue, it is too early," Liksutov said.
Zammera stressed that for the authorities of the capital, the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workloads, are very important.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already being implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure of detour, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," - said the Deputy.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the capital's streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Boredom sinful
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "City of Sins 2: The Woman for Who to Kill" did not make the revolution that could be expected from him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot at the minimum but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we understand the thesis of the noir universe, and by antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on, it should be read: "thesis is antithesis - chaos."
The City of Sins 2 is chaotic on both the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar to the first "City," although, here, the beat Marv (Mikki Rourke), remember, ended life on the electric chair, and then nothing, only has time to snatch - in the role of such a people's vigilante - from the air knives and other axes with thrusts.
But the old people are literally pushed by elbows for beginners, as if stabbed into the city from some other film, the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, its own story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, the superlucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitter).
His own - at the lustful friguided Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, can not be distinguished in person from Johnny - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, characters are demolished with inexorable regularity - no problem or even half a mad.
They are not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of the noir: a fatal bitch, too confident player, caught in the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt ghoul-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and archetype chases, it is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
In addition, even in this mad world there is something permanent.
Fighters from the first "City" still hold a circular defense from the besieging their home slums of darkness.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is no-no, and he will look at the light, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem "Cities of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good in that as a drawer he talentedly combined the comic and noir, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to move comics to the screen.
The comic and the noir are two aggressively opposite "reality."
The phenomenon of the comic in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Malti Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of the noir, then called hard-boiled school - "cool school."
Or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor of Popai - the spinach eater, giving him a heroic power, Superman, Batman and the drawer of Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "Avengers."
But in any movie based on the comics there was something flawed: the painted characters stubbornly did not want to grow on-screen flesh, remained terrifying in the surrounding volley-nilly "real" world.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What are the Forsyths, which Thibaud and Rugon-Makkars, which even Bolkonsky and Rostovs are conceived after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the format of the soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett on his own skin found out that it was like working as a nurse at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horas McKekoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, is rude and cynical, and secondly, is purely social.
This is not an American version of socialist realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural but organically combined the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not shy of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered a monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the picturesque details like the cut off heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nasty - the representative of the neonoisard.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical style of Miller--Rodriguez before the comic.
This may have been because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins," you feel enclosed in a glass ball, inside which snow falls asleep to a toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody goods, but by and large what is the difference?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere, in some places, we sometimes, albeit on the sidelines of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who went along the curved track or, say, to tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city of sin except for sin, sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
boring like any rule.
The chaus "Cities of Sins-2" are simply boring.
For the sake of justice, for the sake of domestic rental, gave this fresh sin a small, but peppermint.
The titers are warned: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which the person with tongs break their fingers, this gives hellish humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
French socialists must "shut up and put France in order," says key ally Fraswa Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "demonstrate a warm attitude" to the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles were not approved by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said, citing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the incurable proposals, it should ease the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of the economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Hollande begged his Socialist party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of the Union, inserted the sticks into the wheels, coming to the meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future."
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that it does not represent that the new government of Wall will last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last for the summer.
"And the new one will not last autumn or winter," Ms. le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of the parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
France's ruling party survived the defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche survey found that 76 percent of the French believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Syans Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to be quick to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional Ministry for the management of state property to the Fund "City without drugs."
The agency intended to recover from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the Fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, because of which it was decided to refuse consideration.
The reason for the representatives in the Directorate of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
Representatives of the fund were also not able to contact.
We are talking about the mansion, which occupied the fund in the center of the city on Belinskogo street, 19 on a gratuitous basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry for the management of state property of the Sverdlovsk region filed a lawsuit to the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize unappeared the contract of gratuitous use of the premises of the mansion-monument.
According to the Directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not contain the essential conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th arbitration court of Perm, which was granted.
Then in the same court, the fund filed a cassation appeal against this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund in the Higher Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, under which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Evgeny Roizman told.
The rent was set at 300,000. The rub. in a month.
The previous administration of the region handed over this building for gratuitous use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the pride Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner deputy of the pride Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman was found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "slander" (p. 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Zashchita" Anna Filatova applied with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her of his blog posts that she was involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will become wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to introduce its new developments, new leaks appear in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, the American media report that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the joint Apple project and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows you to make a payment at the cash desk of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the cash desk.
NFC technology will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced in 2004 as part of the cooperation between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies included in the so-called NFC Forum - the Association for the Promotion of this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and actively implement this technology in their outlets.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on deliveries to Russia "Mistral" does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said Paris about the supply of Mistral-class helicopter carriers.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) in an interview with the Le Monde newspaper on August 20: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," - quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA Novosti."
So the representative of the French foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Actors Fail Chinese Citizen Speaking The Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday has determined a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to take part in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the nominee committee members, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and forced Democratic activists to promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
Li's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong Chinese Liaison Office.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People &apos; s Representatives Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macao State Feng Wei were also required to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Activator students said they would gather at Hong Kong's head of government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention the democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, owned by Palestinian autonomy.
The decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is due to the desire to repay the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
On the seizure of the territory, the Minister of Defense of Israel announced on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control on the west bank.
According to Gaza's spokesman, Saib Arikat, the world public should call on Israel to hold Israel accountable for "continuing settlement activity on the west bank and in East Jerusalem."
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the "state" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" of the seceding region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to hint that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needs to be rethinked to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call on the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as well as those in line with the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: Help the separatists to take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly-proclaimed territory of Novorossiya actual independence to get closer to Russia, not with the West.
In an interview with the state-of-the-art television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the territories captured by Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of fame of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and while government forces attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, "the captive of illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin substantive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin's press secretary's intervention to correct Putin's "infidel interpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to behave in a different way to a separatist uprising in the east than the open seizure of Crimea, where most of the 2 million populations are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much heavier battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the authorities themselves to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, transferring to the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the main Russian navy, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections weighed amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give the separated regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory to Crimea itself.
This led to large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Novoazovsky and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops last week entered the Donetsk region to support the rapportunistic separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air paratroopers captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The nude photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his abhorred the hackers who may have stolen the nude photos of his bride Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is indignant after a number of candid photos depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence, got online as a result of a large-scale hacking celebrity scandal.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of the "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Car Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.

List of 101 celebrity names.
Edelsten, who made Greco's offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrifying that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "shameful" and that those she was targeting "felt to be invaded."
It is estimated that the hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with his former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots where she lies by the pool with nude breasts.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" in Strakhovski and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Should post photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is no different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A Potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
A massive hacking of star accounts may be made through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in Python, which allowed to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same Apple ID login and password is used as for accessing the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the method of brute selection to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of combinations of symbols are consistently introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service the number of inputs of passwords is unlimited.
With the correct security system organization, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user about the attempt to hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to pick up a password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter account, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program for the selection of passwords was written.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that it has no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the account "stars."

On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared extraneous records
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations about how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers got access to the iCloud in the way described above, then there could be a password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web failed to get Apple's comments on the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of man
The ardent facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but an additional means of expressing power and threats, scientists from Australia and the United States found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
An angerous facial expression - shifted and downblit eyebrows, elongated in a thin line of the lips, bloated nostrils - the same in all cultures, and even blind from birth children who have never seen it, says the study's lead author Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion arose for effective dispute during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers have found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and moving to handicrafts, consider themselves entitled to impose unprofitable conditions for them, and prefer forceful methods to resolve conflicts peaceful.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a "emotion of bargaining," the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression of the face should represent the angering individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thereby force him to accept his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on the computer of a person where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the chin put forward separately did not make the face evil, the more physically physically participants of the study recognized the person depicted with such features.
The anger of man, as in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one's own power, forcing him to accept and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and presses the lips for the same purpose as the frog that inflates, or the baboon that demonstrates his flips.
"The anger "lakes" by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tubi.
