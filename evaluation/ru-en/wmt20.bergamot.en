TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mentions Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence or a banned Falun Gong religious group, the Guardian says.
The documents that found out to the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (EconteDance) using the application promotes the goals of China’s foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations relating to China’s policy fall under “hate.”
In each case, TikTok places unwanted publications in a context that fits the general rules so that the social network’s actions do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary system, etc. d."
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also cites a list of banned names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen” including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The banned material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and can result in the user blocking.
Not too strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also attract independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
"Producer Center" - one Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All promotional materials of bloggers "Producer Center" coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without coordination, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether it is possible to speak about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he saw such publications.
The founder of the agency Our Didittal Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The main rules for users TikTok list in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules, you can bring any content that moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
The administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes the faces and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019. ByteDance has opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

Barcelona Blackmails Neymar
Spanish “Barcelona” and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to the French “Paris Saint-Germain”.
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: by agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the striker was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the lawyers of the Brazilian insist that the club should also him interest for late payment.
When in the capital of Catalonia it became known about Neymar’s claims, “Barcelona” sent a counterclaim.
"Blue-grenal" insisted that the bonus was supposed to fulfill the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand a refund of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player in the wagon of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the lawyers of the club told representatives of the player that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in the pre-trial procedure, this will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself so wants to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy it back.

He believed he could claim a cart, as he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beevers grabbed the cart and ran with her in the direction of his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword found in the same pile and began to pursue the opponent.

Mass riots for three
"Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeably disintegrates into separate fragments and loses political content.
Evidence of the very fact of the “mass riots” does not withstand the checks, but in the absence of a political decision to lower this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the matter should inspire society, but will certainly leave in extreme irritation the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with the defendants and evidence turned out to be in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining in the case of the accused under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later he was completely rehabilitated: the TFR dropped charges against him.
Minyailo was arrested for almost two months, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in mass riots (initially the defendants were 13) remained in the case: Sergei Fomin, transferred on September 3 to house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who on the eve of the court extended the arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Art. 318 CC).

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytodranges is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (the most popular - soybean), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not be a full-fledged replacement for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such supplements cannot be excluded.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.

Hydrometeorological Center called the faithful folk signs
In Russia, there are many popular signs, according to which people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short-term time period.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand said, if the sun is red during the call, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the heavenly luminary is white, then the next day it will rain.
The second working omen is based on observing the birds.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then this is usually to the rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, the mosquito's wings getaose and birds are forced to decrease to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are folk signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.

On the beaches of the north-east of Brazil found unidentified oil stains
Oil slicks of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Foci of pollution turned out to be scattered for two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first discovered oil slicks began to arrive on the second of September.

The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that all of them are identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was transferred for analysis of the samples, said that in their composition they do not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
“It’s a thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current,” said the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the union of oil workers of the state pernambu and Parahib Rojerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the northeast of the country, environmentalists have discovered nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the specialists of the Institute recommend that tourists and local residents bypass oil stains and notify about all the discovered foci of pollution.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - B. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings so that the country fully earned a bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely its introduction is.
“In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pensions in the future,” she said. Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, since “permanent changes in this area have finally confused them.”
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to ensure that the size of pensions and social security of citizens improve.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities,” V. Matvienko "RIA Novosti".
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles should necessarily be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation on September 6 announced the sending for approval of the bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for joining citizens to the system of savings, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registering accumulative accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

In the packaged drink can also add sawdust particles, said Nation News expert in the field of food safety Elizaveta Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust at the end of the season do not throw away, so they can be in tea.

It is time to establish interregional relations
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the programs of business development and legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
“Today, communication between the regions is not established enough, as a result of which the business community in all regions visits by senators was outlined the question of the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country,” Andrei Kutepov stated.
In the annex to the letter, which is sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions for the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be the direction of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," the senator told the Parliamentary Newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a entrepreneurship support center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, novice agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.

The Amur Region within the framework of the federal project "Axeleration of small and medium-sized businesses" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be deduced from the shadows
According to regional authorities, for more effective support for small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, since this “most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments, providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including types of activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, suburban buildings, and physical training sessions.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous producers of dairy products with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate the consolidation in the regulatory field of the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and areas of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs for support of small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrei Kutepov assured.
