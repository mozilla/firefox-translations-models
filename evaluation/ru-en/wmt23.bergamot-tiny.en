The July number is traditionally given during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the strips when the soul is eager to climb on Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell about the MIFF next time (while I will only complain that this year the unexplained idea of the fact that happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely offensive principle, which is not sinning by any normal film festival of the world), and in this room we report for what we see.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character produced by Robert Rodriguez of the painting “Chares”, and inside the magazine you try not to miss the story about “The Beginning” by Christopher Nolan (a man who, by the way, rebooted “Batman ...”), himself – without fools – the expected film of the summer.
And this time we publish the first part of a rather detailed guide on the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything, and it is clear that the author of “Support” and “The Rope” is ours Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Glezerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara DondurSergey Mezenos, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaire Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Seraphim Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenko, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga ShakinSuspected of espionage in favor of the Russians and decided to catch at all costs.
Driven into a corner, it will repaint into the usual black and go to look for the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal boy-baby promises to strengthen the position of the actress in the genre of action.
She will arrange one accident after another, run on the walls of the “Matrix” and how children to spread strong men in the same strict costumes.
That’s how beauty can save the world.
Here he is, his native, who blew up and repaired the world "The Fifth Element" and made Millu Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most super-heroist guy, and Gary Aldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And all together turned out to be a tedious block buster of the American type about the salvation of mankind, but the sweetest living carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between Element and "Adelya..." I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this script-producer bustle and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
“Here’s “Adel...” - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some double.
And he himself, real, lived in a small apartment on Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe opposite and wrote a story about the most charming adventurer.
Resell the story (albeit of the tamuting), heating expectations, in this case sinful more than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive is that at every turn or replica you are waiting for surprises.
And all as nice.
Either a girl or a vision
EXTREME ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most decent adventure movie of the decade to hint that “the Extraordinary Adventures of Adele” will begin as “Ameli”, rushing towards the “Jurassic Park”, will continue “Indiana Jones” and “Mummy”, and will end in “Titanic”.
The film is based on the first volume of the comics by Jacques Tardie about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourguen before Adele starred in just three films.
Glorified the actress her role in “The Girl from Monaco”, for which she was nominated for the “Cesar” award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched arm, begging to appreciate the special effects, scenery or tricks, but drags behind himself, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a big journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: “Go, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson handles genre cinema, which everything is known about, unceremoniously and fun, like a boy who has seen old films and the recited Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying yourself cynicism and not embarrassing the risk
DIRECTOR Luke Besson
CLASSES: Louise Burguz, Mathieu Amalric, Frederick Belle, Gilles Lelouch
In Paris in 1912 strange things happened.
The city was woken up by an ancient monster that an old medium awakened to life.
The police are chased by the police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sek, who does not care so much for the beast itself as to the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASE ON JULY 22
“Adel...” – the case when the parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with the spaghetti United Kingdom Sergio Leone, with gangster militants Quentin Tarantino, with the mentioned “Indiana Jones” (he was brought bow here, and ridiculed), finally, with the same “The Fifth Element”.
Besson’s style in this film consists of verbal stunting, acting clown and plot equilibrium (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and soundly as never before).
A few words should be said about Adele's herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, which takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as with the purest courage and courage.
In the movie, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of duty macho or foreign romance
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical sigh, which only spins under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not spend time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and it seemed, the completely sour Luke Besson showed unexpected creative dashing, recalling that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-molls and high-heads of art house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing adventure movie without sorrow, fear and reproach
THE ROOM OF DEATH
The sealed horror with a claim for psychoticism and the political context of 2002, the debut horror film Jonathan Libesman was dismantling critics, but liked the public and earned well at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got to the factory, which arous new horrors from the old patterns: Bay set out to reshoot the whole classic of horror in the form of remakes and entrusted Libesman with a prequel to the Teasskaya Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Criticism again twisted, but the public liked again - Libesman worked in the spirit of "new scary", focusing on the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, you can watch how a whole genre rushes in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing the satiated audience: the naturalistic blood of the spletters merges with the catch-up of slatchers.
The plot resembles the franchise “Saw”, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut picture of Vincenzo Natalie “Cube”. The film is already made by Michael Bay.
So in the “Room of Death” Libesman was forced to go a different way: a dull massacre or a monotonous runaway from the maniac, he preferred the option smarter – almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play with guinea pigs in cat and mouse.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: to unite in a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cell at all costs?
The inspection is carried out not only by them, but also by a young ambitious employee of special services, which is tested for ruthlessly in the wild experiments experienced professor.
For $ 250, four volunteers subscribe to a simple test.
They are planted in an isolated room and give each a bunch of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite person enters the room in a white robe, appears as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The survival game begins, which is closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for a frank arthouse
Can lead a social conversation, and go a fire extinguisher on the face, but can not miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, in her sympathies is cautious and adamant.
In the courtesy lifestyle of her father, she is injured and frankly peeps for how he, as if parodying the famous scene from the “Showgels” by Paul Verhoeven, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of family conflict is not the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it, one way or another, is already predetermined, and the girl’s unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and Snowflake".
The father of the growing daughter in the genre of comedy convincingly depicted Depardieu
The fractional plot hings around the love affairs of the characters, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, on the witty director’s find, focus on the language of view and gesture.
The secondary plot branches (cripared in the car accident, which Alexey wants to marry, an athlete-alkosh performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are only scraped.
Particularly sorry for the line about the business of repurchasing football players, and left behind the scenes.
Most of all, the agent selling football stars is the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The heartbroken daddy himself changes the women like expensive shirts, but the daughter is about to be eighteen, and she must necessarily marry a guy “with a core”.
What is the disappointment of the businessman, when Nastya in the struggle for independence and at the peak of his father chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got “in the nine”: “Don’t look for a problem where it is not.” You can't tell me.
Their similarity simply can not but hit.
In both ribbons there are detachments of harsh guys, soldiers of luck, forced to take revenge on those who set them up and in each company is one beautiful girl.
Heroes will jump on almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular frames - and there and there something explodes, stuffed with dollar bills, and the scenery drops a whirlwind of bucks.
Even the villains dressed in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (played in both cases Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
The previous role of Zoe Saldana is Neytiri in Avatar.
Silvan White used to shoot about the battles dance - "The Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Silvan White was inspired by a series of comics, which was released in the 70's and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - a comedy series of the 80's.
It is amazing how they, without conspiring, led different material to an absolutely identical thundering denominator, making rather difficult, predictable, unnecessary militants, evoke a lot of paintings with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparations invariably are in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you choose between these two ribbons, the “Losers” look a little cuter and clearly more victorious from the point of view of the KPD (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least, there is Zoe Saldana, who is very busy bazooka
ROLES: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
During the operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of Communist commanders working on the CIA set its foundation: a helicopter with children they tried to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves are considered dead since second.
But they are alive – and they intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the languid voice, which set it all up.
All this is cute, but, frankly, spend an hour and a half of your life on the picture of White is worth it, only if you have no options for more interesting things.

A simple story about the runaway Romanian convict
In the Romanian low-budget film, which received a prize at the prestigious international film screening.
In principle, having only these data on hand, you can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Undoubtedly, the movie promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of actors-non-professionals.
Also in the picture there will be many, many, many Romanian poverty (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from the film to the film is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, which in the early 80's read a lecture about Bresson
The film received the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on the play by Andreaea Valean, whose work is in special demand among the directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
Operator Marius Pandouru often works with Cornelio Porumbau.
All this is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not at all abusive, but a recommendatory nature: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the belief of its representatives in the methods of
I haven’t hesitated yet.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith can you withstand an hour and a half spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisterean (whose history, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be easily
convert to the exposition of the 70's, with a cowboy who decided to walk from the prison, from where he soon to go, to the nearest saloon).
DEALEGAL: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantine, Clara Water, Marian Broth
After brushing off his four years, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) is expected to be released soon, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
The affair with the social worker Anna even more moves the guy on desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What a nonsense all!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, suggesting a weak hope that from the Romanian art house will ever grow a decent direction
Cartoon on the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man by the name Grob (Sop) and his co-author Renault was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, a gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all “Ice Ages”, “Horton” and “Robots”.
“Despicable me”, probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at the GO), especially if you like, when different objects are trying to jump out of the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single under-excited joke, because of which on the “Glintian periods” had to shyly in the chair.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not a sense of the authors, but the egregious asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn is dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia.
For the “adult” part here, in addition to the main conflict of lonely paternity, is responsible for a rather tough black humor (who, I want to think, we owe to the director Coffin).
In general, this is a very pretty movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
There is a painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought over every little thing so that the film likes all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see how the heroes of the children's cartoon will eat cannibals or destroy the atomic explosion
The bearish villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics over the years have transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, to fulfill the great plan and eliminate a young competitor, he is forced to resort to the help of children.
In a certain advanced shelter, he adopts three female orphans - Margot with glasses, Edith in a cap and Agnes, in a slaughtered degree of sweetness comparable only to a cat from Shrek.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The protagonist is drawn from Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, noses and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Siegel.
In the final Gru dances the game of Travolta
To the abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of the conditional desert rolls a car, from which three pairs of good boobs come out.
That's exactly what.
The bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera confidently records the attention of this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news - the whole film is sustained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in women’s beauty and the casting has made such a thing that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
A lot of fun happens.
“Brocker”, “killer” and “stripper” dig in the sand, pour water (do not ask why), carry some blizzard and periodically completely fight.
The creators believe that a mother-in-law with generous shapes, smeared in the mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth - this is cool.
"Scurvestoy things" are primarily focused on classic sexground tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Zena, the Queen of Warriors and The Amazing Wanderings of Heraclaw.
A close-minded film in the Moscow box office is “Gonemaker for Jennifer”.
It is also cool, when the bitchy babe twists the eggs of the bandit, the fucking punk fights in a tandem of a Japanese schoolgirl, this is accompanied by a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue is spinning through an infinite number of flash beys.
In general, for a fetish movie, a real Klondike of pleasure is found here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, removing this thrash parody, had fun from the heart, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren’t for the physical data of the actresses, it would be boring by the middle.
We can assume that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes up serial episodes)
ROLES: Julia Here, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Herst, Ron Melendes
Three dangerous rasbs bring to the desert the leader of the mafia, who somewhere here hide diamonds for a substantial amount.
Not having achieved anything and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to fall, fight each other and periodically coming from somewhere thugs, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
In the course of the case, it turns out that all three are not the ones who were introduced at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it is even more fun.
Product for narrow circle of lovers of monstrous melanchory
Yes, with his latest painting “Judsure Day”, the rabid “Mad Max” for the poor, Marshall gave a serious misfire
Bloodthirsty and biting peplom returns the director to shattered trust.
The new politically incorrect and sullen magnum opus is not shy about a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious aesthetics of category “B”.
There is also a hooligan courage of “Dogs-warriors”, and animal cruelty of “Descent”.
“The Marshall Plan” to cleanse the “peal” from the stuck post-Greater film mud, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-covered legionnaires (otherwise others, unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are harsh men trying to get their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
Death and spicy details of the sending of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The stage of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now reference “Gladiator” of Sir Ridley Scott, but to try to catch Marshall in plagiarism for some reason absolutely does not want: he works honestly and without claims.
CLASSES: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
States: Lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, ruthlessly defeated by the reconnaissance of the Pitchers.
Miraculously saved Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other survivors, try to sneak away from a group of Pictite militants under the leadership of the sadist Etain (Kurilenko).
A thin arthouse artist has so far managed to win back only strong supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after the “Centurion” the situation will change.
Peplum - - edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like the Gladiator, only more modest and harsher
Continuation of the story of schoolgirl Bella (Christen Stewart) and her difficult relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lotner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy-siert, designed to bring the world to the four kingdoms.
The ruler of the fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avadar.
The House of Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the dream of an object, it makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - to leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson in managing illusory worlds by Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in the hope of both defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina).
With the help of destructive spells, they will arrange in the middle of Manhattan troubles with dragons and explosions.
Bald, like a billiard ball, the kite conceived to seize the whole world, and now the dogs-supergents are forced to join forces with their mutilating antagonists.
The second series of fluffy family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs led by a flimsy look Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are opened by sporty hunting stylish fangable aliens.
The return of the iconic character of the 80's to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who has teamed up with the rock photographer-now-director Anton Corbayn (“Control”) for a very curious existential study of the psychology of an aging hired killer, hiding from people in a small Italian town and belittling human nature.
“The Corbay-sized Visigrian and the gorgeous George Clooney is a film alliance in the sky,” the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in the life of Clooney - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
As a basis the novel by Martin Booth “Very Secretive gentleman”, Rowan Joffe introduced some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American, and from a gunsmith-illegal, the protagonist turned into a simple killer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to deal with his last thing and finally tie with a profitable craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Rüten), in which Clooney’s character instantly falls in love.
“Jack tempts fate,” says the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is approaching him closer and closer, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be the one for which she betrays himself.
Judging by the trailer, the visual experiments of Korben, seasoned with the ashes of Clooney (the film is like a long clip of 02), reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the main role in the film adaptation of “On the Western Front without change” Remarque
Can I click you from the photogun!?
Johnny Depp this season could be seen in two places at the same time.
First, in Venice on the set of the thriller “Tourist” Florian Henkel von Donnersmar (“Life of others”).
There he plays a tourist in love with the heroine of Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the ground “Roma diary”, the adaptation of the debut novel of the legendary Hunter C. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson (Whitnail and Self), whose last directorial work was the Jennifer 8 thriller in 1992.
Looking at the work of the posters of the domestic prison drama, you can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can not approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although a stranger, but not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
On their account already four joint projects: “Lucky Gilmour”, “Big Dad”, “Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding”, “Don’t joke with Gohan!”.
In July, the fifth comedy, Odnoklassniki, the sixth is “Pretress Wife” with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The graphics also include the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughan, remembered by the viewer this year of the enchanting action movie “Drink”, will reset the X-Men.
In the film “X-Men: First Class” the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play a mutant-telepath Emma Frost nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will reincarnate in blue-skinned mysticism, and Michael Fassbender is supposed to be Magneto.
While the shooting of the new Bond series is postponed, her new director Sam Mendes is not bored.
In the list of his cases is the musical “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and the adaptation of Isan McKuzn’s novel “On the Shore”.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan is the main female role.
Gary Aldman is considering the role of the practical major George Smiley - the protagonist of the series of novels John Le Kare - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Spy, get out!".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979 played Aleek Guinness.
The new version will be directed by the Danish director Thomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror, Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell’s fantastic bestseller novel The Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not an easy (in the novel there are six parallel plot lines), but extremely interesting work.
He has already received proposals from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In the Crimea, the filming of the international militant Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title “Soldiers of Good Luck” are being held.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went for their money to a real war in search of adrenaline.
The roles are Christian Slater, Sean Bin, Wing Rames, Dominique Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere at the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will play in the comedy “Bad Jesus” with English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
As the film company Ragatope assures, the dismissal “is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.”
Nevertheless, the place of the main character and the new beloved hero Shaya LaBehaf is likely to take the English model Rosie Huntington-Witley.
The girl has no experience in the cinema, so she has accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are a lot of examples of successful re-qualification of models in actresses.
Charlize Theron (“Montstro”), Angelina Jolie (“Transformed Life”), Jessica Lang (“Blue Sky”, “Tutsi”), Kim Blessinger (“Secrets of Los Angeles”), Jennifer Conneli (“Games of Mind”), Gina Davis (“Random Tourist”) and “First Vice-Miss of the United States-86” Hulle Berry (“Boelin of Monsters”).Oscar.
They succeeded in acting (also beautiful Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High awards are clearly at arm’s length.
In short, Rosie has someone to follow.
Valeria Guy Germanika, who deserved a special mention of the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film “Everyone will die, and I will stay” and who shot the scandalous television series “School”, received the post of creative director on the MT channel.
The management of the channel believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, it is already planned to shoot your own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanic also began casting new hosts.
The comedy “Koloti” directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into “Screws”.
The main theme of the film remained the same - provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) is in a hurry to Moscow to the bride, but is delayed to train a football team of street children.
The new development received the second storyline of the picture.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital’s bride Nadia will be performed by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue will appear the third - the former fiancé of Nadia Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win in the football championship, there is a dilemma, who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delay in the filming of The Hobbit and the presence of a lot of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro refused the position of the director.
Studios persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters into their own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only in case of urgent need.
Possible successors are David Eits, who finished the shooting of the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film “District No. 9”, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next convention of Sots-Sop at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Chagged from the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers at super speeds rushed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where there were shows with master classes, and the hotel "Pearl", in which press conferences and round tables were flowing, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of competitive films behaved to fit - almost everyone ran somewhere: confused Asians from “Gastauterer” Yusup Razykov and “Other Sky” Dmitry Mamumlia were looking for missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from the painting by Yuri Bykov “Live”
The same cops happily wandered around the finger hero of detective Klim Shipenko “Who am I?” - which, indeed, was remembered by the public rather with the presence in the frame of the total naked Joan of Friske.
The heroes of the domestic show business and in a couple of competitive films appeared - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets speculated on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other.
However, business events on the "Kinotavr" wore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring on any.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, the Russian-made whamp with critics was staged by the chairman of the fund for supporting domestic cinema Sergey Tolstikov: “Do you read articles in the press that I read?” - he asked the audience.
“I am writing them,” the president of the ERVEZS replied confusedly! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko’s film “Ovsinki” was suddenly removed from the competition program – it will go to Venice: the Bostra selectors decided that the extra Russian show their hindrance.
Previously, the "Kinotavr" the giants did not interfere - in Sochi more than once showed films of large festivals: this time, this time, Sergey Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" was involved in the competition, who competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Cote d'Azur.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of the former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, the picture of Loznitsa, on the contrary, did not like it at all - but under the pressure of his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut – “Missing” – received a daughter
A creepy film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero beat, robber and provoke monstrous actions for no apparent purpose.
Accurately directed, cleansing the film-experienced, shot by a misanthrope with a mathematical formation that calls only one to think.
The debutant with philosophical education, Mamuliya calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and argues that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehension of his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star was born.
Flawlessly dressed and tonsured programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained squeamishness, hiding in a burrow of neat bachelor’s life.
But the cast-iron woman descends at the house, the hero's head is the unfair hand of the punitive organs, and he begins a meaningless run through the Kafkae spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants,” producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly said from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics considered it differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull out the “internal debutant” from the luminary of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema bison moves for young people.
Not the other way around.
Documentary film, shot so that the head is carried cleaner than from a similar artistic one.
The author is interested in a screwdriver that explores the electric meter, and a piece of unsalted cream, drifting in a cast-iron pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her brother-brother dock-catter in the real dock-canter with butter.
The winner of the short-term competition, Nikolai Sokolov, tries on the black and white style of the French new wave on the world of the sleeping areas.
Even if the years' mounting moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other - to play Bach backward, look strange, but for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granular carbon dioxide ("dry ice"),
The process is as follows: aircraft at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” these reagents clouds going to the city. The particles of substances condensate the water around them.
As a result of precipitation falls earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the impact on the cloud occurred.
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a sci-fi film in which Michael Iork played the main role.
Recently, Carl Rins was appointed director (he already has a remake of “Breakyard from the Black Lagoon”), famous for his commercials.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Brian Singer (“X-Men”), James McTig (Vent-Tedts) and Joseph Kosinski (“Tron: Legacy”).
According to the plot, the hero, who turned thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens after reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the rotoscopy fantasy cartoon of the 80’s and plans to make it a large-scale movie.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (m/f "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and the fantasy artist Frank Fracetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of beams painted.
In it, the warrior Larne saves Princess Tiger and all the people from the evil lord of the ice of the Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to be attentive to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to engage in a remake of the classic jell painting by Dario Argento.
On the wide screens of the heroes will return none other than Michael Bay - the ruler of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damine Chen, he also adapts the script.
Argento and Romero already collaborated on the Day of the Dead and shot “Two Vicious Views” in 1990.
This time, Dario does not directly participate in the project, but his brother Claudio produces the film and writes the script to him.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolty will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the comedy “Arthur”
“I wanted to bring more strength into the feminine character to reflect the state of affairs in China,” Chen says.
Chinese women nowadays manage big business and win Olympic gold.
Ghosn Lee embodies that power.”
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is it an accident?
Pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I present here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi film market - EMRBE) two paintings.
I play a woman dream in both.
But... So the director saw me, so I imagined, and many probably think that I am in life.
The dream girl.
Your partner in the film Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What's he like on the set?
He’s not at all what it seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, “Yes... I don’t just have to.”
Probably, without human contact, sincere and present, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened to us just a few minutes after meeting.
We're great, I'm not afraid of that word, we're worried.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do it, because I was very afraid to lose this contact, to lose our understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the shooting take place in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I never had a tour there, I never went there, neither on vacation or as a child.
This city has a special magic, some of its character, its charisma.
This is a city that I want to go back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It was not difficult for you to play in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are you getting easy to use emotional scenes?
You know, I'm an unprofessional actor.
And I'm really, by nature, my trusting man.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I actually believe in his hands and I want to be a test from which they will sculpt.
I am well aware that from a better side, and I, again, I ask for clues and talk to the director for a very long time, not even me talking to him, and he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and accurately what he needs.
And then long many hours of rehearsals we come to the organics you're talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I was high from everyone, cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I'm so happy to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I was working with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to stay up, not to eat - and there was exactly such a situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, at least thunder, at least hail.
And if something did not work out, it was a disaster, and we need to urgently do something to make it happen.
In this atmosphere, the madness is very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to painful fanaticism on what they do, it can not fail, because too much energy is spent.
What scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you are to work?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, movies that don't say anything.
I don’t want to work to just appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans now.
I'm not the one who paints the graphics.
The script came, he was interested in me, today this premiere happened.

WASTES OF VOSION
While we are working on the November number, in Moscow there are almost uninterrupted film festivals: American cinema - "Amphest", "2th" 2 - the other day, the "2-t-1" will begin next, after it - the festival of British cinema.
And here’s what’s interesting: half of friends are constantly discussing that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone to support, for some – well, forgive – very vague considerations.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes the terrifying appearance of the Chu4-projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The least of all you want to grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then you will show them.
And in the same number we have no pixels: “Tron: Legacy” (continuation of the classic picture of virtual reality), “Let me in. Saga” (American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), “Uncontrolled” (another approach of Tony Scott to the theme of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, a barbara, destroyer and governor were created.

GUESS WHERE THE CRITAT IS ON THE ROOT OF THE MAGISTORY.
IN A GIFT OF THE FIRST THREE RIGHT RESPONSIBLE TO READERS - AN ANNUAL SHOW AND OAO FROM THE COLLECTION
A multi-series fairy tale about a pretty sorcerer-foothold is nearing completion.
And let the fans of the series have long read the book and know how it will end, and those to whom the word “Expelliarmus” does not talk about anything, and will remain at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is actually booked.
On the studios, by the way, are also not fools sitting: to stretch the spectator pleasure and finally squeeze the maximum from the franchise, the seventh film decided to break into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will stretch until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the Facebook network
David Fincher’s new film is, first of all, a story about the paradox.
The film tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering instruments in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former student of Harvard Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is as magnificent as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a number of reasons: partly because of anger at the outside world, partly because of the sporting interest and partly simply because it is “cool”.
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of the “Social Network” become obvious from the first frames, especially in the scene before the initial credits, where Zuckerberg speaks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) without five minutes: ringing, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength already here and do not soften until the end.
The same with the direction of Fincher: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Winklevoss played dissimilar actors.
The face of one of them with the help of computer graphics was imposed on the other.
Simultaneously with Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara starred in Fincher’s next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTED BY DICTION David Fincher
ROLES: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermi Hammer, Joshua Pence
SPOKES: A gloomy and closed student of Harvard Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn on the personal front from the goal, takes on an ambitious task to create a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows, relationships with few companion friends begin to break out and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays a role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate litigation.
Beyond the flow of incessant discussions in the film is not so much: not a single death, not a single murder, and all the trial troubles of Zuckerberg are unlikely to be pulled at least to an additional paragraph for his meager page in Wikipedia.
What attracted 49-year-old Sokin and 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous detail of the story?
After watching, there is a strong feeling that the “Social Network” is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street did approximately the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and large affairs.
Now that daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer carried out at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winklevoss (Hummer and Pence), while stomping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful and sports can not be smarter?
(This line is particularly fun with Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could well be from the Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what kind of social consequences will entail his invention?
Is he a scammer?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if it has even the slightest hint of something like that.
But it’s not even necessary here: in their version of the story it doesn’t matter.
“What’s it like to feel beautiful?” - asked in the song by Tre Vea Nez "WBU Woz't A Swep Pop", preceding the title.
The hero doesn't know.
The film tells the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a faining idea of beauty and even less about feelings.
Tastemade drama characters about the high-profile litigation of the Internet era
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the names of people of ignorant origin had not yet begun to appear.
It was called “so-and-so-so-so-so-so-and-so-so.”
That is, in the course were patronymic - nicknames on the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of repeated marriages of the father, matronim was used - a nickname named after a mother.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna."
Serfs of small layers really for a long time did without surnames - why is it when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serf prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century. had the names all the whole.
In the XIX century. even small landowners did not keep the man on the ground, but let them go on a robe - let them earn a craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the name was to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released for election.
So, already had names.
Metropolitan criminologists flew to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists of the central apparatus and employees of the forensic expert center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of the explosion of gas in the house on Linear, 39, according to the NHS.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used spare parts of low quality, worked carelessly, and prices for their services, on the contrary, overshadowed, the agency reports with reference to an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where they changed slabs.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
But Kawun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and explosion of gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg managed to avoid a sea flood

Experts were able to prevent flooding thanks to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday in St. Petersburg sharply increased the threat of flooding due to bad weather in the city.
The sea-land flooding was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
Potential flooding could be the 32-m in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the closure of the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty wind, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam was reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again walk along the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the situation with water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents flooding, which can follow the wind amplification.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of shortcomings in the collapsed buildings

The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.7 was followed by hundreds of tremors, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmut, a World War II bomb exploded on Friday, which the sappers tried to neutralize.
A powerful explosion was heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military who was engaged in the bomb disposal was not injured.
“The device detonated shortly after work began on its neutralization.
Fortunately, the entire staff is intact.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage,” Norfolk Assistant Chief Norfolk Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write in social networks that the explosion shook the houses at a distance of 24 km.

The explosion occurred contrary to the plans of the deminers, but there were no dead and wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, there is Great-Yarmount.
Before proceeding to attempts to defuse the bomb, the deminers built a protective rampart of sand around it, and the cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was exposed at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosive technicians at first, on Thursday, were going to cut off the explorator with the help of a robot from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of “slow burning” of explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
Only during the eight-month intensive campaign of bombings from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the "Blit", 450 thousand bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, BelTA learned from the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Ales Solovey.
The share of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of science is also growing: among the candidates of science women are 41.1%, among doctors of science - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
In the technical sciences alone, men predominate, and women account for 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among the candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
Among the teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among the deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most women among senior teachers and teachers - more than 60%.
The proportion of women and associate professors in the department (55.2%) is high.
According to the Republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the NAS last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the possibilities of women in science.
With the gender stereotype "science - male sphere of activity" to one degree or another disagree 63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women).
More than half of the country's population is not of the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% men and 71.6% of women).
“The transformation of gender perceptions in the mass consciousness about the research competence of women contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a woman-scientific, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring,” said Ales Solovey.
On February 11, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually.
The holiday was established to bring women and girls to science, promote women's development of scientific careers and the recognition of women ' s achievements in science.

The probability of raising the key rate in the future is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at the level of 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that recently there have been important changes.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have deteriorated markedly - prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing, but budget spending is growing.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
“Therefore, this year, the probability of a rate increase exceeds the likelihood of its decline.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation,” E said. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, it noted three risks.
First, rapid promotion of consumption in conditions of increased inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, the growing shortage of workers and the lag of productivity from wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate were increased by half the percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023. and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024
“This does not exclude the possibility of lowering the rate this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
Conversely, there has been an increased likelihood that some rate hike may be needed in 2024. inflation corresponded to the target near 4%,” concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia approved the requirements for the procedure for the creation of special closed mutual funds (PIF), consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such papers will be withdrawn from the existing retail PIFs.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment shares.
If in the composition of the retail FDI more than 10% of the blocked securities, the management company should allocate them to a separate closed mutual funds before September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of a new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities, less than 10% of the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets in a separate closed mutual funds.
In addition, a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of the withdrawal of blocked securities into a special mutual fund is introduced.
In the future, in the case of the sale of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, the passenger turnover of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
Analysts of the PSB note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by the state support program.
In 2022. there was a program of stimulation of domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rosturizm.
Also, to ensure the availability of aviation transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidies for citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. d. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022. The government decided to allocate 100 billion rubles to airlines additionally. and to recapitalize Aeroflot for 52.5 billion rubles.
“Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (so far allocated 25.3 billion rubles) in 2023. Passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, to 103.0 million people, ”the PSB analysts share their forecasts.

Austria is once again tightening its border control with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people stay at the border in the cars in anticipation of its intersection on the Austrian side.
Thus, it turns out to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing arrangements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was submitted.

That is why, according to the police, the strengthening of control is required.
The decision to tighten the checks by Vienna followed the promise of European Union leaders to allocate more funds to cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the borders of the commonbus.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status exceeded the figures of 2016 for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.

According to her, when the court will consider the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended, because this person “has spent a month in Argentina and never came again.”
Karignano warned that the Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left, can recall him.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russians were “stuck” at the airport in Argentina due to the refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could count the information provided by the girls at the entrance, incomplete or false.

Somnologist called the causes of problems with sleep
Doctor-somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about food and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any cocoa-containing desserts.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "ragged", and therefore not giving the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop the use of caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they help to reduce the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Negatively affects the possibility of sleep and alcohol.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages contribute to relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts greater than 36 grams per recalculation of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up acute food of volume portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to dive into sleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not necessary to abuse heavy food before bedtime, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: he will be forced to spend his energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and the usual activity, so it is extremely important to adhere to the regime of sleep and rest and allow the body to recover.

The transition to the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The border post Margara-Alijan on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian assistance to earthquake victims.
This is reported by the Turkish and Armenian media.
The same transition was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, the Turkish Anadolu news agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency packages to the city of Adyyaman in southern Turkey, said the special representative of Ankara at the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kılıç.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
“I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the region affected by the earthquake,” Kılıch wrote on Twitter.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Unanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border across the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time the car crossed the bridge of Margara 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margar-Alijan border point was last used to supply humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then the disaster zone in Armenia was supplied with assistance collected through the Turkish Red Crescent.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.

In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed to open a land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

Forecast for the match of the club world championship "Real" - "Al-Hilal" February 11, 2023
February 11 at the stadium "Prince Moula Abdullah" in the Moroccan city of Rabat will host the final of the club world Cup.
In the match for the trophy will meet the Madrid “Real” and “Al-Hilal” from Saudi Arabia.
The game will begin at 22.00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast at 21.55 MSK will show the site matchtv.ru and the TV channel "Match! Football 2.”
Analysts of the betting company BETSTII consider “Blancos” huge favorites: you can bet on the victory of “Real” in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, the probability is about 77%.
The success of the nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even a draw is offered a noticeably lower quote 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that the teams will not reveal the strongest in 90 minutes?
The bet of 1000 rubles on the "peaceful" result in case of winning will bring 6100 rubles.
You can bet at the triumph of Madrid, taking into account the additional time and penalty shootout for 1.14, this market goes to Al-Hilal for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia on the way to the final overcame two rounds, beating the Moroccan “Vidad” in the penalty shootout and the Brazilian “Flamengo” in the main time (3:2).
You can at least give way to the Europeans in 90 minutes, for 3.90.
Analysts anticipate a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 balls is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
"Blancos" is clearly superior in the class of the opponent, the composition of which, according to the statistical site Transfermarkt, is only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison: the rostrya of Real Madrid is estimated at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, by the end will recover the main striker of Madrid and the current owner of the “Golden ball” Karim Benzema.

The matches of the Arabians also turned out to be quite bright: in the 1/4 finals they scored a draw of 1:1 and a victory in the penalty shootout, and in the semifinals - dramatic 3:2.
Recommended bet: the victory of "Real" and TB 2.5 for 1.76.

“The Tarragona Sea Command of the Main Directorate of Merchant Marines under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the call to the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan vessel under the flag of Singapore because the cargo it carries takes place from a vessel under the Cameroonian flag Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 ran under the Russian flag,” the ministry said in a statement.

The problems that arose in pregnant Russians with entry into Argentina explained
According to the expert, against the background of the influx of those wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory more closely.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women to Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
About it reports “Tape.ru” with reference to Professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Heifets, editor-in-chief of the magazine “Latin America”.
According to him, no country supports such practices.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the transformation of the country into a transshipment point, not into the final.
This applies to those who violate the constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will have the citizenship of Argentina, but the court will make a decision on granting a passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit.
In the event that it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may refuse citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Argentina grants citizenship by “right of the soil”, that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU and UK countries.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to recall the residence permit of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant women of Russia were denied entry to Argentina in connection with the suspicion of providing false data on the motives of the trip.

The management company from Kirov was dismantled a license
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region canceled the license for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings issued by the management company "Care".
In the Kirov region, by the decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings was previously issued by the management company "Care".
According to the regional State Police Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but it entered into force only in February 2023.
The arbitral arrest deprived the “management” of licenses for the fact that the organization several times ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were in the management of "Cartaking" are excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand. square meters.
All houses are in the regional center.
The fact that they were left without a management company, the administration of Kirov knows.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Zhilinspec Department informed the mayor’s office about the current situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate 2/3 of the management companies in the region until spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the gubernatorial demands caused doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken in the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officers allegedly also asked the prosecutor’s office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

The girl answers, they say, they do not have a cup of 300 ml.
Is that how it fits in a person’s head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. to determine the technology: pour coffee into a cup or in a single glass.
Get the answer in the room, i.e. in the cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
Put a person before the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, a piece of paper, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Oxol in my memory.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked her for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Cafeteria of Green Okolitsa and Green Okolitsa - the sides of the same medal or organization are not related to each other?
If not related, there is an understanding.
If connected - why did the food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality descended to the rhetoric of the stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetoric because this case, I repeat, is happening to me for the third time.
I don't rule out what's going on just with me.
2. Does the employee have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting in veil.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to the service.
We like the circus very much, we have been walking there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with the children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
Almost from any point you can see the arena and the backs in front of those sitting do not bother you.
The circus is very close, family!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a number with tricks and more animals.
It is a pity that now you can not be photographed with animals in the fodie.
But there seems to be a reason for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your numbers!!!
Liked the developer of Departmentstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
Use quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before the purchase, they were invited to see the complex when there weren’t even walls yet, so that everything could be seen live, although how many apartments we were looking at and not a single developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort of Russia!
The highest quality is the gentle clandestine forest, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are as boring and short.
The longest on the sector, there is even less.
But in general, a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so the fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Great Master Peri!
I did everything as fast and efficiently as possible, in the salon clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for the order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application and wait for the window sill for more than 30 minutes my order.
Today in business such a service is unacceptable!
The answer of the “concern” service is we trying.
At the checkout, even without an apology, it's just - we're not to blame, it's a program.
You did not find any other technical communication options with the regular loyal customers.
“Trust” impotent, and the business has to work.
Thank you all, we all go.
We will not order more from you and recommend even more so.
The spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies of the mistress are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered the car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was designed to receive months after 3-3.5 (as agreed), but the fact came out 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, the car is very pleased, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always on communication, current information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
They rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, the heat (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary dishes.
In stock is a detergent and a sponge.
Of the shortcomings, it is possible to allocate is too little space, in the bathroom a terribly small shower.
There are no places for storing snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and shove it instead of the chair, and put a heater under it.
And so in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the need of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, be sure to come again.
On the territory there are all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repairs and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Lakes Park and landscape.
In winter, there are many slides of natural for children)
Very cool store of tobacco and hookahs)
Constantly here we buy, prices are low, and quality at the level!
Very responsive staff, prompt and answer all questions)
I recommend this shop to visit! ❤️
The location is convenient for who.
It's normal for me personally.
They serve quickly if any of the visitors do not dull.
The recording is convenient.
The staff is attentive, prompted, sent, advised even if they did not come on the reception days.
In principle, it's normal.
That's great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was quickly done quickly, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought of a remote on the eject, and they're so cleverly done to me.
Thank you very much to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8.
They brought after 6 hours flowers in the package, as if stole (small enough paper to wrap flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
Compared to the photo on the site and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that the tulips is an even number of 20 pieces.
Support in Vosapa to my indignation about the color and number of colors responded “apparently confused the color.”
The next day I wrote again and I was asked to reimburse you for 15%.
It seems to me this extreme degree of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office that I have already refused to issue a check.
On the way Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I don’t recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, staining and haircutting.
I want to abolish the professionalism of the master of Samira, she does her work perfectly, I am always happy with her work.
She will always listen carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I recommend this master to all relatives and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level !!!’
Huge saving to the Master Samira 😍
Welcome was in this game club, I can say prices excellent, many gaming computers , there are also drinks and food.
From the minuses, some keyboards are broken, if you take the “ordinary gameplay” then the composition is poorly pulled :(
Therefore, the assessment 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to study in his group, and his mother's in the evening to a fit box.
Super-attentive administrators, the coach is professional.
Arrange thematic holidays for children, watch cleanliness and simulators.
Nice to walk and study.
A child of 6 years old is already a good hit, a strong OFFP.
Recommended for children, mothers and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is done qualitatively, caring, specifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
It was the third time!
I won't regret it!
Finally, I can grow my hair after lightening!!!
And Vita is also studying the color.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine the blasphemy with keratin!
And your hair will tell you THANK YOU
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, refined everything that is included in the regular maintenance.
Also during the repair of my car provided all assistance.
As well as gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for attentive and professional work.
Any question was ready to answer.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that bothered when recording on the maintenance of the total was insufficiently correct information on the rules of work, when appearing on the maintenance of the rules was more clearly clarified.
I would like to express my great gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
It took a very rare, certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate deal, the employees were very friendly met and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very soulful people work here.
Wonderful, soulful, polite employees, did not regret that she came to this hairdresser!
Master Nakhida made impeccable mushrooming, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it all ❤️
I really liked it in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
By the 800 anniversary, restored, inside everything is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, too.
And I will definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful call
Olya has been familiar with more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, they have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learning new things and expanding space for the tetrapods, which only causes admiration and trust.
Always with a calm soul leave your pessip on.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be taken to zootax.
And also bring clean and tasty)
A fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕
Restaurant of the Whity Moose is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very comfortable!
They make delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
Before visiting, it is advisable to order places in advance, especially on Fridays!
A nice well-groomed zoo.
Less Moscow, but equally interesting and comfortable.
There were an adult 300₽ in the weekdays, a schoolboy 170.
The people were not enough, with pleasure walked, looked at the animals.
The outburst impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there is a couple of cafes with sane prices, the toilet is clean free, and the charging station was also seen.
Anyway, I recommend 🙂
The salon at the highest level!!!
Very pleased with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.

Satiated 100%.
Master of His Deeds 🙂
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, picked up cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfectly.
I am now happy and beautiful!!!
Thanks to Natalie!!
Excellent club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and excellent coaches!
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the area of locker rooms.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women’s department.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I put a triple and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I am not mistaken for Timur, but I can be wrong.
I formalized everything quickly, said everything +/-, everything is clear, the son also decided to issue a card, and alas the consultants are busy with their business, clients are waiting, the consultant approached his son in the end, who all to the light bulb, several times in the meeting, that something cheerfully discussing, in the end, the son left, not issuing anything, the consultant said to forgiveness, well, no matter what you want, as I was present.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude to customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (fabricated is resistant to the appearance of pits), the person knows its assortment, help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim and a child with a non-standard figure and growth.
Located near the metro, even a small parking is available.
Recommended!
He was in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, everything liked the service and quality of food: prices are low, portions of medium size, so you can build, or re-order.
The only thing to do is to arm the table.
When I ordered, he indicated the number and everything that was required, and then immediately called the bot to check the phone.
Nothing else.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
Lucky there were free places and we were able to place.
And so, in fact, a very nice restaurant with a great ratio of "Price / Quality".
I recommend it!
I've been cleaning this weekend.
For the first time I see such organized staff, who treated many of my questions as much as possible, said how and what is better to do for further treatment of the tooth cavity.
I sincerely recommend that the only clinic where they do not want to heat money in my memory.
A good shopping mall.
There's everything!
A wide range of products.
Variety of shops.
You can always find the product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
more in this store with no foot.
bought a washing machine, told us that we were for the city, so we will take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, the question "load" ? He said yes. ))
in the warehouse was taken out without a box, why to the question? Responded that this is how everyone loaded.
when I began to insist, two strips of foam were stuck, like that and so it will go down!
to load in the trailer refused, they say not their work, ship yourself, they have delivery )))
when I said that then I would refuse the order at all, they said "yes as you like, we don't care", in the end, one still came down to the point to go down from the ramp and help his father to shoved the machine into the trailer.
This is the first time I have been faced with such boorish service.
Nice shopping mall.Large shop.Big selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" entertainment children's center "Nevialia".
On the lower floor of the large Hypermarket "Tape".
Comfortable,big parking convenient location.
A good supermarket makeup, underwear and homemade goods.

The best place in Krasnodar in which you can relax and everything will pass super.
Advise to visit)
We express our gratitude to Clock Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Arriving at our call, she took the decision of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us to choose everything necessary, was always in touch and informed how things were going.
Thanks to her, we led a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of the loved ones, gave advice on how it will be better and just humanly sympathized with us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
Spinning on a lot of good reviews, I turned to RemSit Mash and I was appointed master Alexander.
He began the conversation with the fact that the next day he is completely free and ready for services.
Everyone discussed and appointed time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and the statement that he will not be able to come, a difficult application (this is how? Where is “absolutely free?”) and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 will appear after 18.00.
Agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander he can come, but after 2 hours.
What are the tricks?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things are close!
In short, the exquisite master Ivan came, eliminated the breakdown, for which he was thankful.
So do not lead to empty promises and do not waste your time.
Evening observations did not meet expectations at all.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to look several times, the adults crowded and could not let others see.
The objects we looked through the telescope were the size of both an ordinary star and without a telescope, you can watch for free.
The girl answered the questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It's not clear why 600r.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has existed since the early 2000’s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
sitting , educating 2-3 dishes for two (dwarfs very large) + by cocktail, about 2500 p
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tetilles, for example, Macho Boracau is extremely recommended to try.
Price 420 r for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself is a very tasty cuisine, I do not know how others, and I really liked it, I advise my friends to go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, since the opening itself.
Good products of good quality.
I bought a mixer, it has been five years, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when the global in the apartment was repaired, everything necessary was taken here.
Excellent gas station!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is a gentle center and side of the region, generally conveniently)!

Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 🙂
It works sommelier.

Experience working with sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
Tela pike - magical, the rook.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My ate pizza, it's FIRE!
Adults were evaluated with truffle, and children with ham and mushrooms.

The Fierce 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different ideas.
Today they were on the play "Punberry-frog".
At the moment, from children's ideas this is the best.
It was very interesting, a lot of dolls, special effects.
Even a 14-year-old son, went just for the company, and said that very good performance.
Rested with her husband for 10 days in January 2023.
Rest was retired for "5", I liked everything!
I will start in order:
On the day of the race, they called, specified at what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price of 850p), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they were allowed for the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, issued quickly, minutes in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
2-bed room spacious, floors and in the bathroom and in the bathroom warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two seats), panoramic windows (in 5 housing).
Furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, even a freezer is.
In the 5th building there are a lot of green plants.
Everything is clean, change towels and underwear at your request, but if you do not ask to change, then they still change for day 4, linen of good quality.
The territory is well-groomed, everywhere the bench, clean paths, in the evening a beautiful illumination.
On the beach and back carries a minibus every 30 minutes.
To the public transport stop 5 min.
In the dining room are friendly guys, always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but who is going for what, everything suited us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always both fish and chicken and coats or so on, vegetables for the side dish every day, the pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, for breakfast, pancakes always drink, only cheese and sausage are not very good.
Medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature is 11-16 C °, sun.
I liked it, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and precisely in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the gym.
Thank you to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been on "Flight" since August.
The daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything is very much likes her, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never thought your daughter was so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look at this promising institution - and did not lose!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend :)
It so happened that I got to the Tomarov hospital with pressure and a high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
Food is detailed, but excellent!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-tie.
Medical staff is sensitive, all put intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While there is an IV, they will come in, they will ask about the state of health ...
Previously, it was possible to make a hearth, but for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending doctor Vetokhina Claudia Feodorovna!
A real professional: attentive, competent, to any question gives an exhaustive answer; picked up the dosage and drugs from which both the pressure and heartbeat were normalized, which previously could not be achieved after contacting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the chief physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thank you and medical staff, and nurses, and harbors!
When visiting the customer service, the impression remained a good one.
I met the administrator in the sing.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers on all issues.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and gave an explanation on my question.
For a small store, even a good choice of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, chemistry for the house, different trifles.
It works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It’s great when there’s a place in the city where you can ride from the mountains.
Lifts of the bugel and on the weekend of course the queue is going 40 seconds to descend and 5-10 minutes in line.
But in general, it is cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are dirt and dampness.
Applied to the service for the repair of iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery was replaced.
Contacted directly with the master Alexander, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price frame.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
Masters are very pleasant in communication, everything will be shown and everything will be told.
However, when replacing the details, the camera was touched, the focus was lost.
Immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything works properly.
This service is good specialists with whom it is pleasant to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are affordable, have.
If you need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Scarce, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the state requires close, operational and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the contents
Excellent LC
Review concierges, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautifully in the territory, close to stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to metro by public transport
Opened in our area a good, cozy place of rest.
There are all the necessary shops.
Slaughter and varied in terms of food food court.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There's no overcrowd.
Well, they've been, tried...
The interior has nothing to do with the Italian cozy cafe has nothing to do with...
There are very few places, the tables are rectangular, as in the dining room.
Pizza... Well, who hasn't tasted better, he liked it, I thought it was kind.
I did not like the fact that the waiter is always behind your back and your interlocutor on the contrary almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Equestrian, yes, tasty.
We will not come here again and I will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best master I ever cut and painted.
Very carefully and qualitatively does everything, I gladly go to her, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
My daughter is also singing only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We and Nizhny, on the way broke down, the good people from KaKResurs reacted quickly and helped!
Respect you and prosperity, more such good people!
And in the service there is clean and good!
They came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the scheduled concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park in the city center is easy to get there.
The park is clear, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the playground for a long time, one dust remained.
There is also a fenced football ground, which, unfortunately, is not very well-groomed.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be purchased in the Crossroads.
The staff is welcome.
I didn't get on bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I'm glad it's close to the house.
You can always find a parking space.
Were in the bar twice, all liked, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - excellent music, DJs know their business.
The only, the second time disappoints the soloist of the group “Hands up Band”.
Not only that sings is not very mild, so he reads the lyrics of most songs from the phone, especially striking when it was the songs of the group “Hands up”.
It's illogical (acting in the Hand Bar up, in the Hands group up the Band).
Rested in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday, a number overlooking the Kremlin was given.
Cleaning in the room every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and towel change.
Breakfast is just a dump of the Tanks.
There is a minibar with insane prices.
If you want to order an eat from restaurant to room, pay for a service of 20% on top.
In the restaurant, the prices are slightly overstated.
To taste three with a plus.
The water park was included in the price of accommodation.
The water park itself can not be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: neither goodbye nor good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help to open the door by seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
You have to work on this to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends to steam.
Large and comfortable steaming, there is billiards, an open-air pool, karaoke.
Food is delicious, drinks fresh)
Workshop on the level!
In a short time, he repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wives).
It's all right.
Quality of work at height.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful Basketball School!
The son walks for 5 months and he really likes, every training is eagerly awaited.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and soulful atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, order through the Internet itself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus there is always discounts and promotions, which is also good
AU is a good store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for the responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria for several tables.
I often go, everything is fine!
Nice swimming pool!
I am specifically about the "frog", Coach our Anastasia Vitalievna very much like the child and professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love bakeries for cupcakes, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always on top.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee, until I reminded them, made, it is impossible to drink, it smells and remains the aftertaste of spoiled milk, decided not to drink and just left.
Last time my coffee was a long-haired black hair, replaced.
Please be careful, as a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
The gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria perfectly adjusts, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which cleans all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neatly for a long time.
The color is selected by type and hair and skin, so that the paint lasts for a long time.
It's better not to make eyebrows!
Thank you so much for my mother’s organized relocation!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, qualitatively.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
All at the highest level.
We have been treating our teeth with the whole family in Novodent for a long time.
Recently treated the teeth of the son 8 years, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
It is not necessary to wait long, there are no queues because. Reception by appointment.
For me, I'm the most delicious shawarma in Tambov only here, I'm not a shawarma lover, but when you want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat is a lot of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows from me.
Often when you eat shawarma bottoms no longer eat as there is a lot of water sauce in short... but not here.
So you guys are the best.
A good teacher.
In the dining room they are always fed fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Pleasant shop, polite employees, good range.
However, a large minus that the goods that are brought, apparently, are destroyed right in the trading hall.
Sometimes there is little space between the rows, and also not very pleasant when the product stands right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is carefully cared for.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the house of culture.
While we were waiting to start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really a publication.
I was looking for a set of clutch on his MB Sprinter.
Quite accidentally got into this online store of auto parts.
Called, pointed the wincode, said wait)
After 10 minutes called back, offered several options.
Since the machine personally-working did not save and asked to order a good set of cumulus LUK.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that the good news was for you.
If you take the whole basket + disk + a length, and take a LUK set of cart + disk and a separate squeezed LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Having taken the clutch went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was found that you still need a flywheel and the faster, the better.
I knew where I would go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on the call (for the first time I also paid when I received).
The next day the flywheel was in his arms.
The car is satisfied with the new flywheel and clutch, I am happy that everything quickly came, that they went to the meeting.
Definitely I will recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year party was a success, but with nuances.
Reserved a double table, it turned out to be planted me for a 4-seater.
But it's not a problem.
It's just weird that they didn't warn you.
Kitchen on the top four, the fish did not succeed at all.
The host with competitions made on the poverinourite of the school level, to be honest, not so much.
But about the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was at a height.
Everything else seems like quibbles.
Thanks for the event
I leave my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the department of the OBD and in the maternity ward, and in the department after childbirth.
But I especially thank Kotlyarova E.Y., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is an obstetrician in the genus. department, thank you so much, for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your good heart, for your huge professionalism.
It's a beautiful shop.
A large range of balls, always fast ordering and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food is amazing, the programs are no, a little audacious waiters, but we were in great composition with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fireworks, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for a good kitchen.
