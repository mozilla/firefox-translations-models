Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts not backed by financing, tried in every possible way to evade the obligations to pay and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9.7 thousand. According to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand were brought to disciplinary responsibility. Officials, to administrative - 533, 75 materials are submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of them criminalized cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums accumulated far from the result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to entrepreneurs in far more modest debts have been brought to fabulous debts.
Here's a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won the competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but the money was not received on time.
The result is an increasing financial account of the debts on wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not applied for help from the prosecutor’s office.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been mitigated as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor’s office operates in the mode of manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, on which all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures to eliminate them immediately are met.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
Qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers will be able to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses in terms of establishing the administrative responsibility of the officials of the customer for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of purchases to provide state and municipal needs", which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand. up to 50 thousand. rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Unit Announces Warning of Movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The warning to travelers to the National Association to promote the progress of the colored population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be especially careful and to exercise increased caution when traveling around the state due to a number of dubious racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the state and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to declare a travel warning prompted a recent law in Missouri, which made it harder for people to win discrimination-related lawsuits, and that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately choose their own targets of minorities.
“People are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind, announced by an organization in relation to the US state.
The group cited incidents such as the humiliation of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eighth-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during a state trip, and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Office of the State Attorney General of Missouri, according to which the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
“The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People should be prepared in one way or another whether they will take money for the pledge or to inform relatives that they are traveling through the territory of the state.”
According to the latest data of the FBI’s hate crime report, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state the state sixteenth in the number of such violations.
Also, the travel warning is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to initiate proceedings against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings to travelers to Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration controls, according to which local law enforcement agencies were ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, was supposed to increase the number of racial checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed in a shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rosturizm Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that “positive” refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
“We need to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage,” he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transportation of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and say this, to say that it is to outerwear, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even some computer will not have a relationship,” the head of Rosturizm said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage allowance with a non-refundable ticket.
We are talking about the fact that airlines can determine the number of places and weight of the luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of financing, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged reclamation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the sewage treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the president said.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection of the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the lake area there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the holiday.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row to check, here you also need to know the measure, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities that take appropriate measures,” he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office announced a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin, during a direct line, stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special regime of protection.
He was informed about the problems with the conduct of economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia recalled that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
In Ugra there will be a new temple
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtyna", together with residents of the Berezovsky district take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas Chudokrevorets.
Its location is the river shore, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a tract beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now domes are installed, church bells are available.
The Igrom EW of the Fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, the fishery gives settlers a job, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open their doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman Chang sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully storing cigarette butts in an iron box taken from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to her one hundred meters - and throws out the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, - reports Chang.
You know, since I was a childhood just a reflex exhausted: you can not throw a wrap from candy to the pavement, immediately fine.
And now there's a video camera everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the city center are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We are not uncommon in corporal punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredible harsh laws, the AIF columnist understood on the spot.
No one thinks to abolish the death penalty here, - explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been spitting on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or sells them, he is put a gallows.
In 2002. 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister defended him, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy in the end still hanged.
After that, drug couriers of our country diligently go around.
The thing is this: in Singapore, it is assumed that the laws are obliged to comply with everything in a row, and not only modest and poor people.
It does not matter who you are a millionaire, deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find a half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you just wonder - how many bans are banned in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the recipe (!) The doctor.
The tourist upon arrival of gum will not be taken away, but it is worth gluing the "cutter" in the subway, a fine of 1 thousand will be sucked out. Local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around my neck: "I garbaged."
For thrown past the burrows of cigarette butts in addition to a fine are often sentenced to “exile to the janitors”: clean parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand. RUB. the "criminal", who forgets to wash away the water in the public toilet, and when trying to relieve a small need in the elevator of a residential building, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and the signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, the public execution of songs and even excessive watering of the indoor plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand. Singapore's bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all, - Mohammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, is trying to distrust me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years I have not seen anyone being involved for violating.
Why do they stay?
Don’t let the people relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold in a kiosk of cigarettes, then everyone will be punished along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the violator himself will receive blows with sticks on the “back”, and the seller will also be smashed and put in prison.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that the offense in Singapore is very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - the motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent to prison.
Many foreigners are a city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993. American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneyland with the death penalty” – a guest from the United States terrified the general wealth of residents, “frighteningly clean airport” and “cultural nature”.
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle it should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you can take it if you go into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area "Little India", and suddenly - "breaking the template": at the bus stop there are plastic cups.
"What about this?" - you're surprised.
And so, - the Singaporeans grin.
Everything happens.
Not for every such "crime" will be seized on the spot, but you should know: if you are calculated, you will not be dismissed - because you broke the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bastards and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone is trying to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to the set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the calmest, clean and safest city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was wearing a seat belt until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we must think that in Russia people would also be happy with clean streets, lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here's corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
Otherwise, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Now the Trump White House has targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it begins to struggle with the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to dramatically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't encroach on the statue itself.
The hordes of owners of pleasure boats and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch it if he tried to do so.
But he encroached on her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled on Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller correctly stated the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It’s about the current sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: “Your tired, your poor, / your crowds who dream of sighing freely, / Unhappy scum of your abundant shores.”
Never before have "unhappy scumbags" have been seen so on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that in America these people are not expected to be.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who fought to put her words on the basement of the statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture by design was supposed to indicate the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, although to change it back.
The brothel Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist, who proclaimed the coming of Trump, in 2010 reasoned that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative, carrying the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: “Freedom is moving forward.
It bears the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light up the path to the United States.”
Against the custom of Limbo really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus’ great creative achievement was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy swimming.
It literally means to look at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and chance for a better life.
Its statue is given to them by the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the British national team.
Eiled Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the UK
Neil Blake, the director of the game of the Federation of Athletics Federation of Great Britain said that a member of the 16 people Scottish part of the national team at the World Cup will make a “significant contribution to the game of the team”.
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championship beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is born in Scotland and the British Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know this and try to understand and will support while they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I spoke to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it has to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they did has to work.
The British Athletics Federation: what they did, we must work with.
And people on the street think the same.
I don’t know why the circumstances happened, but it’s completely brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Eilid Doyle the team chose its captain.
"Ailid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into it were wonderful.”
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth championship, which at its fifth World Cup will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British national team are “unbelievable”.
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Championships was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Murre, specializing in the middle-distance race and beat five British and two European records last year.
It will run for 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman who is worth paying attention to: behind his back he has a good season, in which there were victories at the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual Competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup, when in addition to her the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is “incredibly proud” by the fact that so many of its compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for reaching the final.
“The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you chose – for me this is a very special thing,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all-arranged athletes who will seek to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she wasn't bad.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we’re going to be at the Olympics again.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not run for a public position if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism annoyed him, of course.
But he didn't shut his mouth on his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, “You can take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the mute, will lead as a sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I will go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor’s subordinates called this lawsuit insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of “what and what.”
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people will say.
But that's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in state administration and commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as an initial way of contacting his voters and with jokes demonstrates on his page his bald after chemotherapy the head.
Therefore, to block people who come to the page of the governor - which is stated as an official public forum and is conducted by employees of the administration with the money of taxpayers - it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Amelia Ches spokeswoman defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters who are angry online.
"Post" spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi’s lawyer Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the post article.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leaves comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it’s a so-called cheating, instead of admitling that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates are called a “concentrated spam attack” would probably call an “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than before, when it was required to send people, collect, burn newspapers with critical front-runners, or to arrest and shut the mouth of protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued from Twitter users who were banned on his Twitter account.
One of the first, reversible decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria James K. Cashiers, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the county Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed a claim from the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It doesn't have to be that hard.
During Washington’s era of available postal costs, it made about the same coup as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers was four times, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly brought down its authority.
And even then, Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms “Luricohol”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Porcius” wrote letters to the newspapers ridiculing the decision of Washington.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents Online Project, his cabinet was littered with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
The freedom of speech, dissent and speeches lies at the very foundation of our state.
True leadership means acceptance of this.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for everyday amenities at Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for everyday amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East-Lautoian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A Northern Ireland native who led next door at the Archerfield Links club and was moving towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ils, attached to a new venue and plays as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club, Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance Club and we see it coming to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field in his best moment, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job a job aside this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour tournament.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the player from Southport.
“I didn’t manage to try again to win the Extremadura Open because he was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember him.”
Returns to the fight in his native land Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden.”
I played again and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going on so far.”
On the pitch, the trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Vusnema and the champions of majors for elderly athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Aurr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmoir and Ross Drummond.
Participating in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels over highways that can absorb car-exposure carbon monoxide are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported on the positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highway in the north of the country.
The tunnel with a height of 6 meters is built of some newest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in automotive exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is accounted for by transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40 000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow city court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand. RUB.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, a court at a visiting session in jail released a man from custody.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian “Golden Land”
Preparing lunch, Bardine Degei does not use the stove.
It is rarely used pots.
In her wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of Pania County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a “note”, right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degaia sits on an earthen floor - it does not have furniture - and it is here that she does her work in the house, such as washing clothes with turbid water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and therefore she was not instructed to work in the field.
The polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work late: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are also soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1026 elders forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement, which advocates for independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which retains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Anorotali is a city as remote as abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabira, and then a five-hour shaking on a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19 000 people consists of wooden houses, enslaved by bamboo fences; roofs made of corrugated steel are painted with rust in various reddish shades.
Few people of Indonesians have come here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the papuas meme pago worshiped a god named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“We were not accustomed to wear these clothes,” says Degei, pointing at his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and the rates of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Funix company Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province about New Jersey, home to 153 000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced gold and copper here for about $ 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the cost of which is estimated at $ 78 billion.
These wealth, however, entails one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this goldmine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 papua and thousands have been raped, subjected to torture and imprisoned by Indonesian military forces since 1969.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as stated in another report, rape and electric shock – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the accidents take place every week,” says Andreas Harsono, who is researching in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts dragged on, as Papua’s resources attracted an influx of IDPs from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 millionth population of the province is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, "warungs", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gadoo-yad", supplied with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniyai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial’s administrative center, because of the work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – mother-mother (women) Papua – have lost their sales market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokovy, has vowed to deal with inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua 29 districts, including Paniai.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovy, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says Yoo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jocovi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang Christmas hymns at the campfire in Enarotal as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle escaped from the darkness.
Frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk chased their children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus yemo, was so beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed ayta, a dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and a military base.
When the situation was heated, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio communication: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” he said, according to an official document that correspondents of the magazine “TIME”, but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Yeremias Kayama, the head of the district of Kugo Koto in Enorotal, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, appealing to the crowd with a request to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still does not know who shot, but says that the bullet came from the side of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
In a local resident of Alfius Yowa got three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells him.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one by name to TIME, told TIME.
“I saw that he was dead. I kissed him.”
General Jotge Mende, a senior inspector of Papua police, told reporters that his officers had only “defendered” their base because it was attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more were injured.
News of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovie made a ardent speech in Jayapur expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately, so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately went excuses.
“More than most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done,” he said.
Then Viranto turned down his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with Papua complaints.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the trial.”
The Virantau, whom the United Nations accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniai.
Families of victims from the Government met similar statements with a gloomy distrust.
“I’ve been asked four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change,” Johannes says.
“I’m tired.”
He says he's still alive in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid that the military will arrest me, I’m afraid that I will be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniyai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came for me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighboring Pabiy district of Deiya.
During the clash between villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angrieved villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” said the twenty-ninth-year-old Domingu Bagia, who lives near the hospital and saw how they hurriedly delivered the wounded.
“I’ve been hiding at my house for two days.”
Parliament Deiyai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is dissatisfaction with the meme, Moni, tribute and donated, scattered throughout the greened central highland areas of Papua.
Many joined the Flat Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by singing sporadic attacks and raids on the kidnapping on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of “defending national independence” to the public.
Some never came back.
Among the population, Papua Paniyai is considered a “sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in the Enorotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tubers note are only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between the Native Papuans and new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabier airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village. because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniya tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for “insufficient consistency with the relevant organizations” despite being issued rare permissions to conduct video footage.
According to Felim Kien, Deputy Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the election campaign of Djokovy, to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development, were not fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists now trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mainly limited to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting at Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Arramana Nasir, brushed off the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, there’s still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of episodes of human rights abuse.”
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador, Kiiss Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke the silence, “We want freedom,” according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the papuas say that it is unlikely to vote again for Jokovy.
“Jocovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniya, in addition to living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the people of Paniai, like other papus, consider their vote given for Jokovy a debt that he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in the Paniyai carried out the last symbolic act of reign: buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the policeman and military precinct.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they at least will not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without raising his head.
“What else did we do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-for-story design of 337 meters by height.
This is the second fire that swept through the high-rise building – which coincidentally is called “Torch” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the cries of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," a resident of the skyscraper, who called George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defense Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident can return to the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation, the Torch administration after a fire there in 2015, it turned out that the clamp was most damaged - external panels used for design and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed that the system of insulation and plaque panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of a fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East took advantage of a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign ones increased.
Thus, foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12 944 to 12 525 people.
The number of Russian tourists increased most significantly in the region - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed for the night in the Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans in Instagram, who is to blame for his departure from the “First” channel.
Until now, he did not comment on the rumors, but today he posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper “Vedomosti” for August 1.
Malakhov signed the tag "bos milk socket".
Article on how to prevent the “burnout” of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat “Let them talk”, it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at.
As reported, TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from Channel One.
The situation with dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, a car bomb was killed five soldiers
At least five servicemen were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, the night before near the military checkpoint in the county of Girischk exploded a mined car.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new incident occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange office.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Divere filmed a shark that bit his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the US Agency for Marine Fisheries in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, the Necn portal clarifies.
The man during scuba diving tried to remove the shark on the camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing a man, an animal with a length of more than three meters swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Sokomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal turned out to be new to scientists.
Became known the reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan training center, where a mass brawl took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this battle have already been known.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the page "Vkontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fiercely fought because of an unfilled bed.
It all started with the fact that an ordinary named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer’s order to fill the flashy sheet.
On the side of the officer were soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were defeated in the barracks of a bed and shell, broke the glass.
More than ten people were injured in a mass brawl.
The CVO denied information about the stabbing.
The study showed that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items into the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried in the luggage on the plane through the inspection points of the US Transportation Security Administration prohibited items, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane, by awkward, having prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carrying firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and having reached more than 1000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that is banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously pass by ATB employees most often carry food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted that they specifically carried sharp objects through inspection, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport inspections, and how many they did it deliberately.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggle through the search those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complicated and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB takes away is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider books prohibited for transportation.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
The head of EPA, Pruitt, refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions
The day after the lawsuit, the 15-states chief of the Environmental Protection Agency overturned his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules taken under Obama to reduce emissions of substances that pollut air and lead to smog formation.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency is more than under previous administrations, he listens to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position, lodged before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute unfolded around the October 1 term, by which states must ensure that 2015 standards are eligible for ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone their compliance for one year to give its agency more time to study the plan and avoid “failure to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the attorney general of the state of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of environmental tightening.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms opposed to the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pieut to return to previous standards.
Last month, a federal court of appeals in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority, trying to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration’s rule, requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, having sharply changed course in relation to ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA’s duty to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA could often not meet the deadlines, after which he was waiting for claims from activist groups and from other persons and discussed the timing in the course of the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through lawsuits, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our charter and the power it gives us.”
However, an EPA statement said that Pruitt may at some point again use his “management to defer and other statutory powers” to ensure that the rules of “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader review of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the state rally that filed this week’s lawsuit against the EPA, said the group intended to continue legal pressure.
“Changing the EPA course – after our lawsuits – is an important victory in the struggle for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, directly affected by the smog that covers their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting one can cause serious breathing problems in people sensitive to this, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health professionals and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change of Pruitt’s course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this completely logical step from a man who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to protect those polluting the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extends suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Reconstruction Council of the ARF, which released a report on Monday, in which it recommended to leave the suspension in force.
For the extension of the suspension voted 166 people, against - 21, reports TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the AFLA had made significant progress towards the conditions set by the Rehabilitation Council, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the ARF at the World Cup in London, Russian track players were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The AFLA was subjected to indefinite disqualification from the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the world anti-doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulations, committed by Russian officials and athletes.

Insulting defeat
As part of the 3 rounds of the Fonbet Principe of Russia among the teams of the PFL, Novomoskovsk "Chemist" held an away match against FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" was not inferior in anything to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the Kaluga with a score of 0:3, many predicted a slight victory of the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovsk residents forced them to reckon and acted from defense, but from a position of strength.
In 1 half, the Kalugas were more creative and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and gave his partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack, the “Chemist” lacked effort and luck to baffle the defense of “Kaluga” and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on the oncoming courses.
Novomoskovsk residents played more actively in the attack.
Alarming bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the Kaluga people to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of Kaluzhan played a role - they more competently and cold-bloodedly held the ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemist transferred the ball to the corner, the presentation of which the hosts of the field without resistance were forwarded to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovsk residents will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "Chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting of the Novomoskovsk residents - 18 h. 30 min. near the store "Magnomal" (Eastern, 2, bldg.
Composition "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaithi, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying the wall at the border
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stopped publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall, and according to leaked information, he said to him, “You can’t say this to the press.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In a published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also found a hot squabble.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees bound for Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting,” and stupefy, and insisted that because of the Obama administration’s agreement, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the relocation of refugees to the U.S..
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
The bodies of the victims of the tourists were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on board of which the bodies of the Russian women killed in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the site of the final point of the board, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city hall, Astamyr Akhba, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia, the government of Abkhazia took over.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay to the relatives of the tourists killed as a result of the explosions of tourists flight and residence in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only probes to the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudauta district, two explosions thundered in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, there was a fire of the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be engaged in a grand jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the US presidential elections in 2016, according to the newspaper The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special prosecutor and decide whether they are enough to bring charges.
The conview of the grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised Mueller himself.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for compromising the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, but no exposure documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that the statement of trump Jr. about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which would do any father.

But there is an established in 2010. Space Agency and the desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who has been in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, “move around the planet”.
In 2012. The monument was installed in Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50-year anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992. Thanks to public protests, it was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70 anniversary of Gagarin in Riga, a monument to Yuri Gagarins appeared.
This is how the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian sound, and he looks like if he were 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: Activists to Lose Lynch's Courts on Stand to Call for Justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 drove past the spectators in the village of Monroe in Georgia and rushed with a roar to the small Moores Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - dragged on a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" - the man barked.
"Edge him out of the car!"
Piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which played out on July 22, is just a staging.
But when the neck of Roger was thrown a loop, almost all the audience and really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Mors Ford Bridge to lose the night when in 1946 the Cockluxklanov lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that for all these years no one has been arrested – even though we see them next to us; although we know who they are,” says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a rock on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who has been fighting for human rights for his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want an investigation, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he says.
“We cannot pass to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the sheets of the body of one of the victims of lynning at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by the BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say that the city has always known two related motives of the linevants: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Around the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester in a fight, a white landowner, a white landowner, a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors, who spread in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy’s wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 bail to rescue Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were driving from prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of liners surrounded the car.
“It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison,” one of the FBI reports conclude.
“It is also obvious that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on the voting rights,” he says.
“They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same with you.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been leading the annual performance to reproducing that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her play is clear, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that many would like to count in America.
It is difficult to watch and it is even more difficult to turn away, but Green believes that this is the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about the Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals of this year’s performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest blacks – gathered in the room and listened to the review of the play polished over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role never gotten easier.
“I think I’m dirty because it’s not the kind of person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Racna, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with the fact that Malcolm, furious that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
"I said, Nigg, get out of my house!"
Razonka screams in return.
There's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs loudest.
"What is it," Asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I replaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nnygs'. ""
"Yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You must pierce the firm 'p'."
And also changes energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of comradeship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word on the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
In a hundred yards from her, fifty specturs wipe away tears and sweat.
Among the audience is almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple came from Ikhatha, New York, to see the show; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia’s heavy stuffiness for almost eight hours while Brooks took them to the pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this point, the murders remained only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are immediately in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and see the bodies.
Children bend their heads, touch the paint depicting the blood, and the still bodies and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” one little boy mutts, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it ends.
Actors throw off the rope from the neck and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main dolluklasklanovets.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
“We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that.”
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta is busy discussing a play with a black couple with whom they just met.
Deniza Daplinski is struggling to find words to describe how she feels after the show.
“ It’s hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and the actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynching is still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called that the police are shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights activist, took full of attention.
He says he has already begun to plan the submission of the next year.
“The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to its repetition.
The court fined Navalny for violations on the “assetta subbotnik”
Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny for 300 thousand. rubles for violation of the order of organization of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under the part. 8 tbsp. 20.2 The Code of Administrative Procedure of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organization of the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow Khyzyr Mussakayev ended up considering an administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the headquarters of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand. rubles.
In this amount, the judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “anticipation subbotnik”, which supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the campaign materials that monitored the participants of the subbotnik, the police considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to pre-request permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of administrative proceedings in connection with the lack of corpus or of the offense and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes when drawing up the protocol.
On the most “assistant subbotnik” Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons obliging him to appear in the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same summonses were received by Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist - Nikolai Lyaskin.

This was reported in the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.

The Ministry of energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will affect only the “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal over the supply of turbines produced by Siemens to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by “Arguments of the Week”.

Pyrson cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group of companies “Pirson” announced that it will cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent due to the start of another restructuring program aimed at combating the problems faced by their business.
These jobs, which, according to the head of the company, John Fallon, will occur mainly in late 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pierson announced that it plans to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting program to try to bring back to life a business that has hit a rapid transition to digital learning techniques.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase in sales of the main product by 1 percent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in death bomb
According to information from official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in the NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh, three civilians were also killed.
The explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
According to NATO, the explosion that occurred on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a “manported improvised explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment in an American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, the suicide bombing caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shaï in Kabul.
The Taliban said they had attacked.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people – the most serious terrorist attack in the country in the country since the United States-led troops were removed from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether it is necessary to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially to the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Agency for Environmental Protection after lawsuits cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era Act, according to which states should limit air polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “omezone measurements – 2015”, stressing that this step shows the agency’s readiness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced its intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to delay ozone measurements in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter standards of air purity, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming that it was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection orders imposed by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But the actions in this direction have caused resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency says that the use of ozone-containing air for respiration “may worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The Association of European Businesses Opposes New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the economic sanctions of the United States against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the EU countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people’s deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the Great River embankment.
Deputies of the city Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Svoitekov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, control over drivers will help make this territory more calm and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs "Pedestrian path" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvement were carried out in vain.
Sports and playgrounds because of the cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the PPP motor patrol and vigilantes.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin demanded from the investigating authorities not to withdraw hard disks
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to ban the investigating authorities not to withdraw servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to “exclude the use in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, “it is enough to make copies, certify them and use them during the investigation.”
The head of state added that it is impossible to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise’s activities until it is impossible to pay taxes.”

The Russian foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop silt Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was distributed by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop silting Russia.
As the “Arguments of the week” wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who, apparently, are steadily moving towards holding the most excitingweight boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office spaces of ESPN in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the world boxing organization champion in the second semi-environment.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four weight categories Erian Broner on Saturday on the TV channel “Showtime” both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko’s manager Aegis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
“I used to be in a semi-lightweight,” Garcia said.
“I went up to a category for the sake of Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not so big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to a half-easy.
And he needs to climb to a half-easy [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s give them this.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“The box needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he holds that Lomachenko has his debut fight in weight 135 later this year to set a meeting with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after the fight.
“The fight can be on PPV because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing a willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said that he considers Lomachenko a “angling boxer” and, perhaps, will visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks “very slow, sorry, Mikey ... You were knocking out.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the strike, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising before their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”

New test results for assessing age of asylum seekers in Sweden
Recent test scores of asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested have been rated as over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6 880 cases for testing, and the forensic medicine agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent of the test scored was rated as people 18 years or older, and in 25 more cases, the forensic agency assessed that the test subject is “probably a person 18 years or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that a person “is probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is in doubt.
According to Johan Gurensson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with the results for the past months.
“We don’t see much difference with the statistics for past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were rated as over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely, the age of the tested 18 years or more.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, people openly stated that 18 he turned 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting in making an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tarography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Krenpoint Institute Claude Marcus, part of whose work is an assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the ways of measurement that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with confidence, we don’t have to pretend that we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Guerssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, we can say that the risk of mistaken for an adult is low.
With the biggest risk, we face when a person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.
I'll think about whether to run for president
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think whether he would run for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the village of Cheryomushki in the Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is, we all ask you to run again for this post."
“Okay, I’ll think about it, thank you,” the president said.
On July 28, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "only unfounded, hypothetical reasoning."
"While there are no staffs, the creation of the headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
“So far, it is not on the agenda,” Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia said that he was moving to another party
The governor of Western Virginia, Democratic spokesman Jim Justices announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections. Today I tell you to the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you while remaining a Democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration as a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in Western Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday that “Governor Justis’s move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party that is more of a flaw in which he is working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the least number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of the party that has no leaders from top of the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” said Ronna McDaniel, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
The cat-heavier named Mr. Handsome found the house thanks to social networks
A pituitary tycoon of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) has built a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.

Coe praised the “sincere” apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian representative of the Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen at the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence found for the use of doping, funded by the state.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations Coe told reporters.
“The whole council and the entire congress liked it. that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia in their rights,” Coe said.
“Over the next few months, we have to do everything to settle this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that it is still necessary to fulfill a number of demands to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and the detached coaches are still doing their job calmly.

From the Ukrainian delegation also excluded coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes of doping.

How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record-breaking transfer of Neymar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may be followed along the chain, for “Paris Saint-Germain” by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power to prohibit the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of financial “fair play”, introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($222 million) to free the Brazilian from the contract alone, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can definitely fork to hire Neymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the rich energy of the Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to purchase players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legal sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs climbing into huge debts in their quest for success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend serious to improve the team and create a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During the current three-year assessment period, which is exciting 2018, clubs may incur losses of €30 million.
And, despite the fact that Platini was disgracedly removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA Alexander Ceferin is still determined to hold back excessive spending.
“Of course, “FPP is alive, and we, moving forward, will tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press, who controls “FFP” in UEFA last week.
Although PSG will pay the ransom of Neymar’s contract at a time, he can distribute this amount for reporting on the entire term of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer value can be shown in annual reports as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, as well as the Manchester City, were subject to the Manchester City-owned Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (under the rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of his team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outwit its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the owners of the club.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the amount of funding was considered higher than the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could have been made in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar would become an ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to track any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the provision of PSG.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Reporting for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will grow by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angrowned fact that one of the best players leaves, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG will violate the financial “fair play”.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” President Javier Tebas told the AES newspaper AES, referring to Qatar’s ultimate owner.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s doubts about the financing of the club by the state.
“It’s all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football in the last fifteen years,” Wenger said.
“When the club is owned by the country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of taking the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how the new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
From the entrant will be released children under 18 years of age, as well as incapacitated, follows from the revised text of the amendments to the bill “On citizenship of the Russian Federation” (available to “Izvestia”), which the Committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing an oath when joining the citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing the documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in the bill, providing for the cancellation of the decision on the issuance of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet. 2 p. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism. 4 tbsp. 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when drawing up documents for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - embarking on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill in April was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma Vladimir Vasilyev (“United Russia”), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (“Fair Russia”) and the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been redesigned again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law “On citizenship of the Russian Federation”, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, from the text of the bill it was not clear where such an event should be held - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state authorities of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the registry office.
To make a solemn oath wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will be after officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport a person will receive only after taking the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will swear to swear by Russia from the age of 18, and not with 14.
There is a rule by which incapacitated or limitedly capable or also those who cannot pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath will be freed from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and other persons,
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for the admission of residents of Ukraine to Russian citizens who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship, providing a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be transferred to Russian officials.
Refusal of “alien” citizenship, as it is now, is not required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - United Russia).
I think many of you know that it is simply impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who renounced the “other” citizenship in writing and handed over the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond his control” he was not permanently considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, to be hired for objects and in the organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country can not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by that time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in “Hot American Summer” and “Comrade Detective”
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of simultaneously the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; about the era of grunge in the 90s (approximately when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Chawalter made the comedy sketches for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurdist humor (including the original story of the talking jar of vegetables, which X voiced. John Benjamin).
The result is doubling of the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually annoyed children who have just reached the age of majority; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
“Ten Years Later,” where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more system-free and includes riffs from stalking films of the 90’s like “Hands shaking a cradle.”
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many story moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margherit Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not parted with virginity.
And there is still a insane and vile conspiracy, in which Ronald Reagan (always a show, who is now incited by George H.W. Bush (the experienced parody performed by Michael Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to retreat from it.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Rudd, who sings the song of Matt Dillon from “Lones”, the character of which, the former big man Andy now looks old man.
To bring this franchise success could be accidental madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven Up", until it comes to the point that, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from "Americans", "Explosive Blonde" or even "Glass" with its images of the struggle of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 80’s about two police officers in Bucharest, fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist pathway.
The main roles - the life-seen Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelius Uchlit, and voiced their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a chess match, as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices - among them Jenny Slatt, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevignya - allows you to interestingly play "guess up with a voice".
But "Comrade Detective" so holds on to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are delayed, and it is not so funny and not often.
If it were shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, there are two fat people who absorb a bunch of hamburgers.
This image tells the imaginary viewer-communist that Western culture is capable of making oberration out of anything.
Fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.

He also added that to date, there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartak" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.

Two young Ufa people cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufa man who has a furniture company appealed to the police.
The man said about the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The production of thieves were tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, perforator, hydraulics, winch.
The guards began searching for criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.

Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car service that came across.
A case of theft has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The state Department commented on the words of Medvedev about the relations between Russia and the United States
The U.S. and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the state Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, having adopted new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on the Russian Federation.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “area for interaction”.
“Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
“And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, US President Donald Trump signed last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document is unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.

Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” he wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC by the intention of “to focus on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of buying a daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopen became the main contender for the purchase of a division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after in March, President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions against their subsidiaries.
One of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
With explanations about the incident was made by the head of the department Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck hit the road in the road, hit the power line, as a result, there was a shutdown of the Kuban and associated Crimean networks.
Power failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts have troubled the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could be abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation has caused rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable, and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family incomes.
Specialists of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for maintaining rates at 0.25%, with fewer members of the committee in favor of raising the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts by an increase of 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control the inflation caused by Brexit, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Also, the members of the committee voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago due to Brexit.
Starting with the next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan, on which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it has announced that it will now provide another £15 billion to 115 billion pounds as part of this plan.
In the bank’s decision-making protocol on rates, said: “According to the main forecasts of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to suspend inflation, it would take “some more fiscal policy tightening” than the markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank's forecasts for a rise this year and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged by 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rates weakened the increased expectation of an increase; then GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase a little at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of households affected by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before falling.
The bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” the decoration on earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages “significantly” will recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to rise as a result of the growing demand for British goods due to the low pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after last August the rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates are likely to take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank rendered its last decision on rates, there was growing noise around the alleged rate hike, as inflation put more and more pressure on domestic households under pressure: three of the committee specialists asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the fall was expected to be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is completely a consequence of the low pound.
Andrew Montleak, director of Mortgage Brokers, Koreko, said: “If we take into account the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be even more competitive again, as lenders require business opportunities and count on a good end to the year.
The market looks especially favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of a commission, as well as at a low rate, becomes more popular than ever.
Public Health Service to Miss HIV 10000 People Who Caused Controversy
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after the Battle of the High Court on the issue of financing the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PPP), a pill taken before sex that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which argued that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay PREP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called “the most critical innovation” of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Distribution Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (Pres) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PRI significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before having sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensary will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and persons whose partners do not know whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attributed to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international tender for purchases signed a contract to provide the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug about its digestibility and application on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest threats to the health facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Administration), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PRI, if it is correctly aimed at people in need of help and at risk, makes it possible to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new means of opening up new opportunities, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing this with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now we need to take care that the test quickly unfolds across the country, and that none of the HIV risk group is not forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental PEP drug, we are going to protect more than 10000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We are very pleased with the start of the PRES, it is very late due to months of delays and delays from the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to a complete understanding of the advantages of PRES.
It is now important that the trial is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to step step towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (CUC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of preserving the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively established form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress emphasized in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.”
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan in force since July 24, 2007 has been concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the name of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called the “president”.
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IMB).
To get such rights, you have to wait for the queue for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad by car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, since it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as so.
However, in fact, everything depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, and someone has enough national rights.
To insure, drivers still receive international rights, but it is worth considering that in the countries that do not ratify the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have no right to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the traffic police, Kommersant reports, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in the units of the traffic police, coupons are simply not issued, forms have not been enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the Ministry of Emergency Situations is impossible to get “for technical reasons”, without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced a problem, in social networks more and more often appear such messages:
Irina Burmistrova: “Count us why it is impossible to get international rights in Moscow?”
That's right, because all the traffic police stations are running out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of knowledgeable people!"
It is necessary to obtain international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it is always clogged far ahead, on the site of the coupons are not given at all (they is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg time free to FIG.
Have you tried someone else to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving licenses have changed, so new forms are supplied to the units of the State Traffic Inspectorate.
This may be associated with a deficit, however, it is unclear what changes are in question, not previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supply them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand were manufactured. Fans of the IPU, in 2016, 15 thousand were purchased. forms, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was signed on July 18 with LLC "First Printing Yard" for the manufacture of 70 thousand. forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold a tender, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not yet unclear, so people are reinsured, so there is a hype demand for international "cooks".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Permit (IDP) of the new sample is valid since May 31, 2011.
The Minister of justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal “Observer”.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bomber or a wrench there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there are virtually no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot build less large-scale facilities normally.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I believe, the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that turned out to be so short-sighted as to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of a vault of the automobile arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the enlargement assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge was completed: its vault is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At a time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation for fairway supports," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio have?
Permanent absentee stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.
What only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the “servants of the people”.
And, nevertheless, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time the “sensation” was from Spain.
There, Valencia Archelman Carles Resio managed to stay at work for ten years.
He received a regular salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And here "miraculous times" Mr. Recio are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that a malicious stalker every morning came to the office at 07:00 to be noted in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 16:00 to again note in the system that he left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time the walker was devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish the immediate chief of Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to “work actively” his subordinate in his workplace.
Judges are offered to protect against the chairmen
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of government.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the chairmen of the courts and introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential order.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin of January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with members of the council.
At a meeting with members of the council on December 8, 2016, including individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed. "K" from December 9).
The result of the work of the HRC was 25 proposals, which relate both to ensuring the independence of judges and identifying judicial errors, and financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him to its appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases to judges.
To do this, experts allow, can be a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman does not have the right to “predetermine the results of the qualification certification of a judge, to initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments.”
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to the “execution of the chairmen of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation.”
Now all the chairmen of the courts (from the republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize an appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC said that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
They have “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guaranteeing at this expense a greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use “telephone law”.
The HRC proposes to strengthen the world judges of the HRC to consider some “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, on reinstatement, the protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of a driver's license, etc. p.
"These are only our proposals," explained Kommersant a member of the HRC, a retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the President’s instructions applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the order of the Supreme Court (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev should until September 1.
Living a high life: a semi-floor and cunning designer techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker involved in the refurbishment of real estate, moved in 2014 from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a pretty typical house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack his belongings and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Erls Court, and there were just as high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day.”
Since the first view, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom of a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add space for storing things and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demands,” she said.
To this end, she hired Erfane Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use the ceilings of 12.5 feet high and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but Joan would be good for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor where you could stand full.
Erfanu had to think creatively to deal with a brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the premises so that they were one above the other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the designs so that they were at the right height and allow the use of the premises from above and below.
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the allotted space – and many more interesting things.
From the semi-floor, through the vintage copper light window from the "Retrouvius" overlooks the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of entertainment, expanse and light.
A short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror pane appears to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets serve to store all Joan dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can be blocked by the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a moving door up, as in the garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” Erfan tells about the reinforced steel-fiber-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, the area of the sexes is exactly what you’re selling, that’s what your property is valued on,” says Erfan.
“Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the area of floors, using high-quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as evidence that due to good design and increased footage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the establishment of a commission on state cultural policy.
The corresponding resolution was published on the government website.

The commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.

G20 Inflation Decreased to Eight Years
The growth of consumer prices in the G20 countries has decreased to the lowest values in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging in the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
He allows deforestation during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to take it in the fall.
In turn, the President said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of deforestation "does not cut off everything."
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory authorities.
Media: the soldiers of the APU secret from the command agree with the militia of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
Soldiers of the warring parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and communication does not know about this in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militias of Donbass established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
About it on August 4 reports “Strana.ua” with reference to participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, according to the results of such conversations, a truce is on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a particular officer received congratulations on his birthday from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militia of the DPR and LPR are sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against the Donbass.
The foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of the statements of the UN security Council on attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by the terrorists of the groups “Hayat Tahrir al-Sham” (formerly “Jabhat al-Nusra”, banned in Russia) and “Failak Al-Rahman”.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously in the qualification of the “Nusra” as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that “it would seem, of course, that the Nusra terrorist attacks should meet a general unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of the attacks against diplomatic missions there should be no ambiguity.”
However, as emphasized in the diplomatic department, “for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, hiding behind the arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to accept a standard summary of the Security Council statement for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.”
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said and added that “we would not like these barbarians to have the belief that someone in the Security Council is at the same time.”
Vladimir Putin called for the restriction of the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned ones, and also said about the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Oft-planned inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from withdrawing servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope it will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to business activities, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "Kommersant", due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, by order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that in fact there were scheduled inspections unscheduled (the share of those faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections on applications of citizens (from 15% to 19.

Brothers Fight for a Real Estate Empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest real estate in Victoria in the state of Victoria in real estate worth more than $ 500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the football club Carlton and the developer Colin de Lutius lives in the Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is a fierce dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with her mother, Anna, the brothers own 87-mocked objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the company "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of possessions of the De Lutis family includes office buildings, buildings in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Bouller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Luthyce family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul - about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin’s property is 316 million, and Paul – 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
Judicial spending is growing like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cremer are attached to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best taunting.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950’s, they have managed dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970’s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of the school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to sons without conflict.
“Luige often told me that he didn’t want the brothers to understand the court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark received 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of his office.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to a biography published in 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Kolin replied with a text message stating that since the case had not yet been considered in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and rattle the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in the testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father doesn’t want to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that he was still hoping for a resolution of the conflict.
On Friday, this hope seems to be dissipated.
“The decision in our case will soon be made by the court,” Kolin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to limit the receipt of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House office plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hopefully keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowiy reports.
“At the meeting, which was held by the new head of the White House John F. Kelly, with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined the main problem at the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of receipt of information to the president.
Kelly told employees that the information should pass through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better off if he received the correct information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed, trying to pacify Trump by tracking the receipt of information.
President Trump’s relationship with television has developed decades ago – and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he was receiving fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the election headquarters, told Policico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the Politico at the time that “according to the six former members of the election headquarters, in order to keep Trump’s habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in coming to him personally.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the election headquarters know something we don’t know – for example, that if it weren’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to promote their agenda by giving Trump material – reliable or not – which confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the inclination of advisers to constantly advise the president with doubtful information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmaworker:
Current and former Trump officials say Trump could respond very harshly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone slipped the president a printout of an article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the office Katie Welsh was accused of “stands for a number of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the employees about Welsh.
The Goldmacher adds that then chief of staff, Rains Priebus, and Secretary of the device Rob Porter, “tryed to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager than the Irrabass, but Trump is still impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These persistent factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Tyumen Prosecutor’s office is fighting HIV dissident
The Prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, who stopped a criminal case against a local resident who died from HIV a young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated on the part. 1 tbsp. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection stage.
According to prosecutors, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman was not treated by herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,” the prosecutor’s office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was received by the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “forgained his wife, has no complaints to her, she made up the harm and apologized.”
The prosecutor's office did not agree with the court's decision and filed an appeal, demanding the cancellation of the decision to terminate the case and send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make up for the harm caused by the crime.
An HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, ”the press service of the prosecutor’s office reported.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow suit.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - over the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their minds - allowed to conduct a diagnosis, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hiding, fleeing with children from hospitals.
What is the danger of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first Russian study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and they see a serious threat in their spread.
A creepy photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, occurred on Thursday, August 3, at the railway station Grechany in Khmelnytsky.
A cheerful company of drunk young people walked through the bridge over the railway tracks, where the freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, told “FACTS” in the communication sector of the police in the Khmelnytskyi region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he clinged to the power line and immediately received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an “emergency”.
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the trunk of 1-2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that in recent years extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport are becoming increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of the oceans on ancient Venus
On ancient Venus could exist oceans.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, “Arguments of the Week” wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the “millionaires’ street”
Some of the wealthiest West Midland homeowners are again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the moats dug by the municipal authorities to reocate a field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street Solicala, which received the joking name “millionaires’ street”.
Bringing horses, babies and many houses on the wheels, they returned after being kicked out no further than in May and were prevented by a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactile company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through a section that was left unencumbered to leave room for the path.
The enraged residents attacked the municipality of Solihulla, saying that he was “unable to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident reported: “They came here on Monday evening, after being kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be shameful and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were chased away, and they came back again.
Last night there were even more gypsies, and today, perhaps even more.
“Birmingham’s municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I keep paying a municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
A local resident who asked to remain anonymous said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw how the horse was grazing in the meadow. ”
A spokesman for Solihalla said: “We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the plant of champagne wines "New World"
The SUE of the Republic of Crimea "Factory of Champagne Wine "New Svet"" decided to corpore by transforming into OJSC "Champagne wine factory "New Svet", follows from the order of the Minister of property and land relations of the Crimea Anna Anyukhina.

Determination of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise, 1.2 billion rubles are needed. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds of large credit institutions,” said the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to conduct its corporatization and put it up for auction.

Nizhny Novgorod third-graders defeated more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identity of citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-class students.
The first statement that the tomb plates were damaged by unknown persons was received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people appealed to the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Minor offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the monuments were falling, and this prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone to ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they obeyed the new rules governing their operations.
“If an NGO does not obey the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with Turin’s daily Stampa newspaper.
Minniti’s warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rette on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which lasted only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work now in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement on social networks.
“We will be able to assess all the charges made now, only after we collect all the information and will be able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities are monitoring the ship Juventa, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board migrants who were sent directly to them by lifeboats and allowed smugglers to leave with the boats, which they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, so according to the accusation, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in this area, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other motive.
The Code of Conduct provides mainly that Juventa-class vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: “Save the Children,” the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they do not entail any “significant changes or interference” to her rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization “Doctors Without Borders” (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on initiatives on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy on the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan sides have tacited.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Devov told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who is betting on.
The contact group on Libya, which you head, is almost unknown.
Here, say, the contact group in Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "B"."
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "B"."
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you lead it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from Mechanika Chebotarev.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based on Faiz Sarraj. - "Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "B"."
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we quickly managed to agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group includes five people.
Among them there are people who have experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is constantly in Libya, no one is in our staff, so far there is no need.
Are there any Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors?
And if so, whose side is it?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications are not true.
But your contact group is the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed for us for us as Misrata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and noticeably intensified in subsequent years. - "B"."
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were frightened, they said that there are all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is really the role of the Islamists.
In Misrata, we met with all representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to themselves.
And what conclusion did you come to?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar carried out operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte fought the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regardie.
As we understand, you are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, on the holding of the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj reached at the end of July in Paris?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, the agreements will be disrupted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke very negatively about each other.
As for Russia’s position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar on this day was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told: “You are probably very brave people who came to us today.”
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support Haftar only, we are conducting a dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners on the human, emotional level make it easier that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows, he is Russian.
But the fact that he studied here, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And by the way, not just with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian well.
And are drawn to Russia, to some extent they experience nostalgia for it.
Do you consider it possible to cancel the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, they are interested, but, as I said, we do not occupy someone in this conflict and would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in equal terms.
As for the arms embargo, the Libyans constantly make calls for Russia to somehow contribute to its removal.
The process of drafting a constitution is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise solutions, will achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and finally elected a legitimate government (and now neither of the parties has such a status), then it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue is now meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of floating from Libya African refugees, feels abandoned to the mercy of EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it for example that Haftar’s detachments will establish control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers who transport immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, and Sarraj, and Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, a large role is played by tribes in southern Libya, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the southerners stop the flow of migrants on the far outwards?
That is, relatively speaking, turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants go?
We're trying to do that.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in ensuring that these flows continue.
We hope to promote the unification of the southerners in the negotiation process between Sarraj, Haftar and tribes in the south.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical are he?
Will this not become an obstacle when building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is the legislative, executive and judicial authorities.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not climbing there.
And we mixed all the maps for them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft was carried out.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'm going to resell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
Plans to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, is the “oil in exchange for services” scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are actually working at peacemaking there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and squeezing out terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR in Libya (now or earlier)?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, there is not a single native of Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said he had about 50 thousand. Recordings of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and the Russian speech does not sound there.
What kind of states are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into these details.
Let’s put it another way.
How many are the Libyans themselves among Islamist militants in Libya?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are not more than 5%.
The others are strangers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and declared their readiness to come to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits should still take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.

Michel Carter's sentence for reports prompting Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for making text messages and phone calls to suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, who is now 20, will have to serve 15 months of his term behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at a hearing on Thursday: “My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, squeezing her arms and lowering her eyes.
“By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not recognize responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t show up remorse.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that, in his opinion, her “age, the level of maturity or even mental illness did not affect her actions in a noticeable way.”
The prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy, saying, “No day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I cope – I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.
Roya's sister, Guamin, said that she was relentlessly persecuted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
“To be deprived of a man who has been with me always since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as Massachusetts does not have a law that would provide for responsibility for counseling to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter’s message.
“You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, I don’t know how many ways to stab yourself,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote: "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You only need to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy’s death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers were divided on this matter.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British apartmentmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published in the “Los Angeles Times” her dissenting opinion, which stated: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Evgeny Bogachev: “I let Langford go like a high-flight bird”
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender “Izvestia” commented on the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played in UNICS for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, gave 100%.
So I let him go like a high-float bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award to the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, was the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second ever-in-July star of the Euroleague, which goes to the Chinese championship.

Burned in the sun tourist from the Moscow region evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygea rescuers today with a helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic of a Moscow tourist who received severe sunburn.
The man rested in the orphanage "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased blood pressure, as well as breathing difficult.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man received burns on a hike.
Audi will modify up to 850 000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement from the Audi, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes that “there are more intelligent pathways than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a review.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with the rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the oxides of nitrogen, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers installing equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust is also rising, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of inducing influential automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “destruction devices”, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted so that it complies with the rules, and in conditions of normal driving turned off.
In the United States, several leaders of the Volkswagen were convicted, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development group.
Former manager, Zacceo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European ejection rules and expanded the investigation that was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of “Audi” in the investigation can create serious problems of “Volkswagen”: the manufacturer of luxury cars is a source of disproportionately large share of the income of “Volkswagen”.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank branch about the discovery of the money received from the catering point, a suspicious banknote in denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Forensic Center found that it is fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors to the cafe who bought shawarma paid with a banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash desk was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of the banknotes.
Currently, the police establish persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade objects are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a “hellish” planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time, having studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were a lot of surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts drew attention to the fact that the water molecules are so heated by the star’s light that the infrared radiation emits.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and weight comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 “terrestrial” days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2 500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to dry weather and insect disease-absorbing disease; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at Provence’s CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute, said: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially autumn, the rains have become much less.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And there are still small cicadas that jump over the leaves insects, carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very many.
A lot has been at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in great demand in perfumes and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or even missing.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil.”
The solutions that are now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and excreting varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 in the framework of the thematic week dedicated to hockey with the puck.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on skates on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenirs of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the children to study as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important at the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
“It’s great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The holder of the Universiade will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019.
In the state Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the US state Department Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, said about the need to find a “area for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to “improve bilateral cooperation.”
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria on a truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia said this, then, of course, it has the right to talk, but I can’t say anything more on this topic,” the representative of the State Department said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on toughening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war to Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions will be valid for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment “clearly beat” trump.
Missing in the suburbs bodybuilder found in someone else’s dacha who lost their memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by friends and local residents.
And there was Shamil at someone else's dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was completely naked found in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and the passport disappeared.
Identification helped to declare his missing.
Arriving on the call of doctors recorded a partial loss of memory and traumatic brain injury, according to the public Mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for evaluation, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products of the projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be in the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the commission of operations for the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for buying foreign currency at organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly Riiodos newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the last violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, suppressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be safer: to take the children with them to an office in which they already threw a grenade in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote on a board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being kept by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, because of which the work of covering the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of Riodose, Javier Valdez Cardnas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodose building; two reporters over 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts on which his smile, face in glasses or his signature Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists are discussing their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases were investigated.
As in most of the thousands of murders committed each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists rarely stand trial.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although it is now much more dangerous around.
Without information about the killers, without justice, there is little benefit from talking about security at meetings, says Ibarra.
“It’s very silly to waste time on this seminar,” he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodose office in the capital of Kuliacan.
He managed to travel only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter left in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly diverge on Kuliakan.
But about Valdez, almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let’s not say that every day on the streets of Sinola kill one or more people, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated double-deteam mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of “calm” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions that is at war with Guzman’s sons.
The publication could anger the sons; the people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn’t force Valdés to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper was captured that wrote about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003, together with five colleagues, he founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to engage in journalism, not touching on the topic of drugs, Bochoreques said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not afraid of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about something that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodost received the prestigious Maria Maurs Cabo Award for a report work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for courage in the investigation of the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it conducts.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa - "this is a way of life," he said in October last year in an interview with Rompufiento TV.
“You have to take the tasks that fall on you as a journalist – either so or you just smear a fool.”
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do when there were so many deaths...why didn’t you say what’s going on?”
Employees of Riodose miss Valdés, a joker who was arguing like a loader in a port, a friend, a generous hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on their order.
He should always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, a bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: did he be ruined by the love of the newly established order?
His death forced them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like when you’re at their wives, children, their legal business, and underground drug transportation airfields.
“These things were the limits,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and aspirations for self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from what doesn't smell bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodos Andrés Villaral, is that "the smell can be deceived ... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer act in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggleways, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where employees of Riodose gathered for a security training, it was suddenly forbidden to pay cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware that is sold exclusively to governments, is used in Mexico to spy on journalists and social activists.
From the outside, two police officers hide in the shade of the tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to guard the office of Riodose, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakana.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked whether these police officers were not included in those 50 percent of the ministers, about whom the governor himself said that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of the gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue of "Roidos" counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Kuliaakan’s most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officially, it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors were made loud accusations of corruption.
Villaral asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of “El Chapo” Guzman escaped from the raid of the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez’s column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
“We would have known what happened before,” says 46-year-old Villaral, for his thin physique nicknamed “El Flaco”.
“Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought of was: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to demonstrate at the local prosecutor’s office, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write “SOS Press” on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington trying to secure international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdés, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would hurt her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not just by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on orders of politicians and security services who are in collusion with organized crime.
The Antikulo 19 Press Defense Committee estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed on the orders of the police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez said.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body found a note allegedly written on the face of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close as the newspaper “El North” in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to the El Magnán of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country at all.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they still look for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it evidently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance every day between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for publication, the publishers of the Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones at the same time rang at the same time.
A series of shootouts between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodose website via a mobile phone.
The next day I had to remake the first page.
Nearby, sirens were lifted - another shootout in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked at the police officers who were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on display all of Sinaloa, Employees of the Riodos continued his case.
“How can you think about closing,” said Bohorkes, “if the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send her to the street to make a report?”
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
It is so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown – and say that it had, in some way, “dark past”.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved of Thyreophore in the history of finds and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
This fossil is a recently found specimen of the nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call him “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyreophore is the most well-preserved fossil of this kind in the history of finds, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Sankor Company Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more carefully.
The fossil he found was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The next six years worked on the discovery of an animal inside an earthen block weighing 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the completed result can be demonstrated.
“You only have to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he sleeps,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
By studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite being covered with a shell and resemncizing a walking tank, apparently, was exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This coated dinosaur coated with a powerful shell used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective color, which is also used by many animals of our days.
This would allow him to merge faster with the environment and avoid meeting with enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the family of nodosaurs, was widely printed in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7000 hours for its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimism allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the protective coloring is well prevalent, the discovery was a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of living animals with a protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivores that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way to survive.
But most modern animals with protective color – such as deer, zebras or battleships – are significantly smaller and more affordable prey, which indicates that nodosaur had to seriously fight for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive dinosaur-covered powerful shell shows how dangerous the Catotry of the Cretaceous Dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scale of the dinosaur also indicates that his skin should have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and with his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans, most likely, spread much further deep into the land than now.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is now the animal looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You do not need to particularly resort to imagination to recreate it, you only need to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he sleeps. ”
The Cretaceous period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealotelta, a tyreophore could be hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include an acrocantosaur, a 38-foot-long monster (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mimified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millennial mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best preserved thyreophore in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch thorns protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore was hard to hit what is now Canada until the flooded river took it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as a lottery win.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossil residues of the skin still cover bumpy shell plates dotting the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the scales on his sole.”
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
About the arrival of Saakashvili reports Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted on his YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikheil Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The term of the investigation in the case of Weinziher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Yevgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinzircher was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the issue of extending the accused house arrest.
The representative of the Investigative Committee at the meeting announced the decision to extend the deadline for the preliminary investigation last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conducting investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the leadership of the Komi.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzikher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "VimpelCom", transferred bribes to the highest officials of the Komi Republic for the establishment of the most favorable tariffs for thermal and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, viewing the Facebook ribbon on the phone.
She came across a high school post.
It said, “Police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Drawing attention to the fact that none of her tape did not put this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened a Twitter.
In her tape there were many user reposts with the nickname @TheePharoah.
A rapper from the Greater St. Louis in real time covered the death of Michael Brown on Twitter, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old boy killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of the lifeless body of Brown, spread out among the street, where it will be four hours.
“It’s savagery,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put her phone off, and later returned to tweets that people were going to Canfield drive.
There were photos of the signaling tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be the father of Brown, who held a poster with the words: “A policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, she said, "whorore the triggers and yelled, "I'll kill you all... Animals!”
“This is a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said at his own time.
“It’s not like the kind of we’re used to and what we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a bristle.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the subject of the new documentary Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower and a wreath under the color, they remembered a conversation that was led before this morning in countless times, "about the experience of blacks and their position."
She recalls, as she said, “Remember, how did I tell you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it was wrong."
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be raised on it.
It should not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of blackness experience and their positions and what we must do to become free to free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done a bad favor if I fenced her off from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florissant Road, on a site located across the street from a police station that became something like a tent camp while the activists were waiting for reports of the final indictment of Officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little in the mind Ferrell found the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Students-Saten Minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I didn’t have the experience of the organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer "simple wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play?”
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often whites who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and steadfastness.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not fall into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already merged with his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on those sentenced to death.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrell and six other local residents with whom the team of the project “Whose streets?” kept in touch for years since the murder of Brown.
“In this documentary, not someone is talking about us or with us, we say that,” Davis said.
“It was the most important for me how these people will be presented, because it’s how I will be presented to myself.”
And although the goal of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader, but about how the community unites,” as Volayan said – she turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, “Whose Streets?” Surprise personal aspects of Ferrell’s life are shown, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at how I first saw the finished product.
“But I knew that when you do such a job and you make the blacks, there should be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the story of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Blacks Life movement is important.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – are ranked as homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support the entire movement,” says Ferrell. - And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a host of homosexual black women.”
However, she insists that “it’s not a case of positive discrimination,” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film’s central character because of her distinctive features.
“She was the person who waived that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it was in the foreground, because when.”
You can feel its energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been out of the cinematographers, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be at a probationary period for the shutdown of the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which it is called the house, simply: “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran football players were disqualified for the bite of US players
The footballers of the national team of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Golden Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the striker Josi Altidor, and then pinched him by the chest.
Then midfielder Seren, when pitching the corner in his penalty area, bit the defender of the United States Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Serena - six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York, people’s faces hang from the ceiling on the wire – white, black and brown, all somehow elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from smears from the cheek and hair trimmations sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent pruning from Fort Levnowworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called the “The Appearance of Similarity”.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident that Barack Obama commuted the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing with the help of a computer program of DNA obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could have people with such a gene, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though not easy-to-perceive manifesto, not only the plasticity of DNA data - various ways of their interpretation and the ingerter-determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from a teenage oldly openly said she considered herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so that only one of her photographs was known: a granular black-white selfie, in which Manning in a platinum shade of the wig, clearly feeling awkward, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photo, they began to be associated with this photo.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg completed her 2012 project “Visits of Strangers”.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with bask batons and chewing gum, excreting DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at a preview of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
Thus unusually, the artist and her muse sitting in prison became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of comic books “Suppressed Images”, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who portrayed how in the future the president will mitigate Chelsea’s punishment and she will be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book was released, was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war on people revealing classified information in the government, and invents new ways to inflame the hatred on Twitter that he is designed to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all time, she said that "but nothing happens."
In a statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a hearte instead of the dot over her “i” in her last name) calls for an end to “automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil C, G and A.
Turning 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is exquisitely expressed in a scientific way), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly we are all similar, at least in its biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is,” Dewey Harborg said.
“Data from DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, fitting in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in the comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears over the building of the US Correctional Barracks with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
"That's why never shut up."
“It’s a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as it was previewed in the comics - but when she comes, she will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacs, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as is everything at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), in which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I would have hung them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
“I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind its liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University employee is looking for police on murder charges
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee, who are wanted as suspects due to the fact that a man who has a stabbed to death was found in a luxurious issue in Chicago.
According to the Records of the Cook County Court, warrants for premeditated murder without release were issued on Monday under the bail of forty-deal-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was injured in multiple stabbings.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Place apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on their bodies.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranloh was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death of stab wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has served as an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the vice president of the University for Liaison, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was forbidden to go to the campuses of Northwestern University.
“Now it is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North-Western University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior employee of the financial institutions of the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement: “We have spoken to the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation authorities.”
The statement also said that Warren’s colleagues are in shock and want him to surrender.
The chief of communications of the Chicago police Department Anthony Guglielmi said that he strongly advises the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are getting stronger,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a mysterious message that something happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself had occurred on July 27.
According to him, data from video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The leadership of the Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, which stated: “At the moment, the police are working on a chronology of the incident, collects information about the victim and considers a number of motives, including a possible household incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will comply with the requirements of the road map of WADA in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be met in the near future.
“A certain stage in meeting the requirements was passed, RUSADA received the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with the UK AD (the UK anti-doping agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for the restoration of compliance status with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
“Everything was announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andad-poarm structures should publicly recognize the results of the investigation commissioned by WADA’s order of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: “We are investigating, because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen.
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems in the Russian anti-doping structures that had previously taken place, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unauthorizedly, no one is going to accept this report,” Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow office of the organization in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to restore his work.

Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, August 4, reported the news service “Radio 4” with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit none of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress for this.
Metro of Yekaterinburg masters a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid by bank card, said the general director of OJSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for the subway, as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to use the subway with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another “Uber”
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of his startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insinali.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“It has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, a San Francisco-based 75-person company engaged in electronic hair care.
Therefore, she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new type of startups in the field of work with personnel, which help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensed software, the purpose of which is to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, contact certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass top management and access directly to the directory.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” - says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the startup Glint of Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel in the three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company heat map and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are gradually aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another “Uber”, which was involved in the scandal, when the former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, this is the desire to control the situation – an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technology, the global management, regulation and compliance industry by 2020 could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The Startup of Convercent from Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect poor behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid falling Uber’s reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the customers.
As with Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individually executed surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential answers in real time and view the thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report poor behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the Directorate.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company does not treat employees well or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants where more than 25000 employees has been operating in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or an email of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal management of the company “Ruby Tuesday”, saying that there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the “Convercent” service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages – can be found and do them faster.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from lawsuits with employees.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm "Arthur Andersen" collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of "The Enron Case".
But only when “social media has been widespread,” the companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry from viral spreading on the network.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies with a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture capitalists who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Talo Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research demonstrates that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to be.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, feel they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they try more to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Group is used.
Investors get income when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses are doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of employees, then it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4000 sentences, you should be ready to hold 4000 conversations,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at the managerial firm Kotter International, who had to see how companies make the mistake too much of relying on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I have to be?"
According to Errett, the company “Madison Reed”, which is now conducting monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with the help of “Glint”.
And, after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it more effectively keep employees in the industry known for high staff turnover.
“If you’re not trying to create a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul, open a new asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, they took drastic measures to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where twice there were pits on the newly aspháhted roadway (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street) decided to “open”.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways occurred due to the fact that the land sank in the area of the ownerless unused network.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee on road management, improvement, transport and communications Ivan Harmat, a detailed survey will be conducted for detailed survey and elimination of prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that the restoration of the formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to practice longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
Time is approaching eleven p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on the campus.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, exposing their backs shining from sweat after the intense first day of the sports camp.
For many players, teams these moments of idleness make a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes, after a three-hour workout, will go back to the hostels to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said: “The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat grinder.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on the players, actually lengthened their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the beginning of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California at Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two training sessions per day was the greater number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six meadow seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 trainings until August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of Texas A&M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change in the rules on the part of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of it, another item appeared in the close schedule of players.
“Within three or four days we give them this huge burden, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just overcame it, they work, they’re great guys.
I think that when we live to see you Saturday and we will have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles, will make training closed; it is not an easy task as its fields are in line of sight with an adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have overcoming the protective net behind the gate.
Players from the Bruins should occupy a hotel starting this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a video of the training, this is very serious.
But we will have security there and will be the security in the parking lot number 8.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims during the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall that the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was blown up by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious on the mystification to independent experts, and show their findings under the original posts, said on Thursday the world’s largest social network, which is trying to combat the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them to check, and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the initial post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe have had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential election in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not promptly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported on the testing of a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are disputed by independent inspectors, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they are reading and what they share,” Facebook’s news feed manager wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “related articles” function and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Skotney was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70's and 80's served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the Bulle River in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, Yorkshiretz with a bunch of hair and a penchant for historical documents, a comic novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he said.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evidrian era and tells about the families who lived in the Cattle; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Bryoni May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Teeth of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched it to the depths of his soul.
“I could just touch the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700’s by a double agent who worked for Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint"
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days a fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
How much I love the archives!”
For a man grasing with such a passion for old papers, to get support from the National Foundation and the English Art Council and live in the castle for four months (“Honestly, I have seen a little bit of a fortune,” it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, walked the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that lay in the vomit of centuries.
He walked through the park and on the ruins of the old castle, talked with foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he “drinked whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of Skotny Castle is not very studied, because the National Fund gained full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassiy, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, employees were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as “that the aristocrats have been dumping for the attic for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think that the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, " but this birch two families fought for this birch.
It happens, guys!”
In some of the stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero leaves the castle just built to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called the “Knightly families of Kent and Sussex,” says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought the riot was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrellov family hid at home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Punisher", about the smuggler of the XVIII century Arthur Darrell, who is believed to stage his own funeral, punching stones (this was discovered a few years later, when the coffin was dug).
Darrels are a favorite family of Rhodes of all that were inhabited by the Cattle: “The gentlemen, it seems, were a perfect crook, forever got into debt and spent money on what they could not afford.
In different generations, Darrel men solved their problems with debts, marrying rich elderly women - I imagine them as a company of pretty guys who know how to care for the heirs of great states.
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyanmäki - the place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it again overgrown with forest.
But the cattle remain a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he said.
“I felt something like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again.”
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven other credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of entities that have left ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that announced the break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, following the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks, depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims there was also criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justified to revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by the objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, begin to prepare for the entry into the association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ARB is at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out."
Investors will be better
How's the case over?
We will answer immediately the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: investors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, who is known for his scrupulousness in everything related to the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of the “regionals”.
In personnel and organizational terms, obviously, also, there are no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and managerial situation after they lose such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest organization, an organization that defends the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that the association "Russia" with open arms is ready to accept on any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day, representatives of banks who left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
There we will decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "there is no such time as a chair", called the new head of the updated Association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association “Russia”, where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary Congress of “Russia”.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine to large cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine into large cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the environmental class.
And there is the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I think we’re not technically ready for it.
The question is, from what year?
It's like that at the level of slogans of the phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Close the whole city?
“In 20 years – I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” – quotes “Prime” the words of the Minister.
Earlier, the Izvestia newspaper reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the general director of PJSC KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars with ICE in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and do so by changing how the U.S. gives out green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own English, have the money resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
We did not have time to think that 2017 can not get worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex robots has been released.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Honored Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas that are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “tune” their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot’s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to customize in robots the qualities that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are also sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farra" gives the impression of shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
“The Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly,” the website “True Companion” enthusiastically reports.
So she loves what you love, doesn’t love what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood throughout the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in the mood!
In the appearance of sex robots, a lot of concern is a matter of concern – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most concerned about the subordinate image of a woman, associations with rape that causes the possession of Cold (reading: resisting) Faro.
On the website "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
If a woman (sic!) Maybe there’s a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?” - it says on the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire of sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR celebrates their growing popularity, they still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the age in which we live.
And many people are not bad and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence – that these complex sex robots came about when women’s rights around the world were in danger when there is a president in the White House that boasts of what sticks to women.
The most terrible thing in the television series “The Handmaid’s Tale” is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but exactly how realistic this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn’t seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is with their “characters” that robots do not look like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor a biography - nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, are maids.
A native of Los Angeles Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, since 2013 who has been playing for the national team of Ukraine, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket portal by the general manager of the “blue-yellow” Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come for family reasons.
We will go to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place at EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, at which the “yellow-blue” could not overcome the group stage, and a native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to play for the national team of Ukraine since the departure of the head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
The wards of Evgeny Murzin in group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which it lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
To portray Mit Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all tense so tight that we're gonna get the phone.
Less talk about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, the left-wing poetess from Chicago, who has long been in knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unification in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump’s at the White House, everyone she knows, including a Republican brother, with whom she has debated about politics for decades, has been on the same side and strangely.
At dinner, this is undoubtedly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his reign can put us all in the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization”, we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop hitting his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly seem like a model of common sense.
I caught myself so much pausing today about Mitt Romney’s old-fashioned madness – with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like) – compared to Trump and both seem very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park – the largest carousel in the farm of the New York City Department of Parks and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don’t need a caffeine.
Horses are menacing and huge, the pictures made of fiberglass on the central drum - grimaceous clowns and animals that, bent, look at their back in horror - extremely sinister, and the ringing music, oddly enough, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views of the skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too bored to cause a trembling, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still worried about the day when I found out that the Suiss-Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the thematic pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” is not counted), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child is two years old, a child of eleven years and two women in her 40s can have a great time.
If I could put a rating of the carousels, I would put a five, but fortunately no one asked me for it.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before I was asked to draw a terminal card, to evaluate my “experience” of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, all the same plus the option to accompany the tip rate of 15 percent - this is for the order at the desk.
As a result, not only slows down the neutral interaction, but also has to make a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
A poor saleswoman at the department store smiled embarrassed while I was tired of assessing my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves the prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of falling in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor’s appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend for a night thief who had hidden in his bathroom.
The prosecutor's office announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against Pretorius' six-year term, which, according to her, is too soft.
The Prosecutor General’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
The term of Pretorius may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV elected a subscription not to leave
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a preventive measure in the form of a recognizance of a non-departure for a man who attacked the journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
“In the framework of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under article. 116 The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Beatings”) against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen a preventive measure in the form of a subscription not to leave and proper behavior,” Volk said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast to the Airborne Day, a drunk man approached the correspondent and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the Air Defense.
According to Razvozzhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovites.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the BBC, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sydney, who put the tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC TV channel that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and already impose serious fines for everyone who is caught during parking in an undetermined place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian foreign Ministry accused the Vice-President of the United States in the rhetoric of the “cold war”
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to state that Washington is increasingly sliding deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to the words of Pence about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “with the West, or with Russia” and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the alleged uncontested accession of the entire South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law, using force to dismiss Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop the leaning of Russia and its foreign policy, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs
The accident occurred in the suburban Stupino, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today at about 08:10 GMT there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance capsized," the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region told TASS.
Law enforcement officers work at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her son on the construction of her newborn, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Separtansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly took the child to a medical facility went to the scene," the National Police said in the Odessa headquarters.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a umbilical cord.
During the priority operational-investigative measures, the identity of the mother - a 36-year-old local resident was established.
It is also established that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously fallen and was not on a special register.
Currently, the police establish the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into the garbage chute.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going into battle, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, will celebrate its 55-year anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked with the observer of “Izvestia”.
I remember how your "half" was celebrated.
Special tent in "Luzhniki", Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You're probably pretending to be holding your next five-year plan.
Have you come up?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, three times I went on with tours all over the country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not the same now that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
Singing as I sang at 30 is getting harder.
Nevertheless, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think, go to another level.
With them, you and the new album are recording, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're sending it to Matching in Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" according to the song of the same name, which is written together with Timothy.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We will do this later when we shoot the clip on it.
And we will present the album in November - to the series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new album had a hand in a cool American drummer Chris Coleman.
You seem to want him and attract him to your touring team?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to my studio, recorded his roles.
I asked him to join my band, and Jeremy Colost (a famous drummer involved in different projects. - "News") offered.
But for the long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35 thousand. up to €45 thousand in a month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed your own (smiles).
Sometimes I want to find fault with one of them, not for something.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about it, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with a different performing technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the US?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Honestly, I'm not doing anything now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really feel sorry that I can’t get to America.
I've said more than once that I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful.
We are not stupider than them, but we do not have such experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years did not set the tasks that American musicians always solved.
They sought the highest quality sound.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK refused to enter me for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year so that I will be allowed to go there again and most importantly - there to work there.
The rest of Europe is sympathetic to me.
And in August you have a concert in Monaco, not custom-made, but poster, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good hall "Sporting", I've already performed there once.
Now they have been invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
On "Rendeev Laima Vaikule", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to serve herself as beautiful vocals, and even a whisper.
After the tour and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
Two albums with his songs you already have in the discography.
When is the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky about the same serve as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked about this topic with him, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy man, so we will see how it turns out.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually entered into your repertoire.
Maybe then you'll record his stuff album.
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed paths several times and asked him if I should sing this or that song?
He said, "Gregory, I write songs so that they are performed."
Please try it, sing.
It’s probably interesting to record an album like that.
While I do not have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may do such a project.
Unless you're focused on your production center.
I suppose before you realize his potential, did not sign contracts with all the artists you are interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice".
We made a contract and we are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights that he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, I'm shooting clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the output they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, proves how I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to tour Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
This is mostly about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by his own opinion, flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics will think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to succeed, at least in the near future.
And before I gave for a year in Ukraine 40-50 concerts.
Met as nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists collaborated: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and it is a pity that now they cannot fully throw out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some kind of cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But I don't think at the moment it's unlikely...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical director of the Vostochnyostsky cosmodrome, began to work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SCNPC).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (TSECI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not be a replacement manager: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality is spread by the units of the TsENKI.
The fact that the technical director of the Eastern and the deputy general director of the TsENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov moved to work in the Khrunichev SCNPC, Kommersant was told by top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in a new post for several weeks," the interlocutors of Kommersant in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from TsENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the SCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director for the coordination of production, the company said. - Andrey Okhlopkov assigned to him the task of ensuring the starting minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome has fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work in TsenKI in 2013, having service in the space forces, in particular on Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, with his filing, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill the obligations to clean the separated parts of the carrier rockets in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities assigned to him in TSENKI for technological development extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who then headed the Federal Space Agency, in an interview with Kommersant, directly said that the situation on the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact is that the planning was a strategic mistake: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To make a launch before the end of the year, they decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go to the trick: the specialists of the TsENKI began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the postponement that occurred (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew away only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a source of Kommersant at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction site.
Mr. Okhlopkov was remembered for his directness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer in the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work on the starting and technical complex for the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of the TsNKI regarding how to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
“We decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be required: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered to the units of the TsENKI.
In music schools there will be a training program for two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this you can re-read re-read students repeat disciplines, and the issue of paying for other classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during the “Non-Children’s Conversation” of Vladimir Putin with pupils of the Sirius children’s center, a student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for repeated items in the second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studies in the class of violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico detained climbing the wall on the skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed on the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico City.
The young man with the help of two unknown men climbed over a three-meter fence to the territory of the complex of office buildings of the Nestle company and independently climbed on one of his towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Detained a young man on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing a skyscraper has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man a “spider-man”.
According to media reports, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help relieve IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies have shown the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate the symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of tryptophan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the gut are making sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that can trigger an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body and at the same time not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in the intestines have increasing cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building elements of the protein - to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Columna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is part of the normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerance-intensive cells.
The more tryptophan was contained in the nutrition of mice, the more these immune cells they had.
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the intestine.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barganvas, studying a type of tolerance-intensifying immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, they were not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the intestinal microbiomes of mice – communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinium cells of the mice was sequenced, and six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells were found, but not in mice that do not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reutri, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then suffered small portions of fluid – without bacteria – to undefeated immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan, known as indole-3-milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane level was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragagan explains that people have the same tolerance-in-tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether triptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as well as mice, but people with inflammatory bowel disease have been found to have defects in the genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened by us, since inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reutri could potentially lead to expansion of their population.
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United have hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic
“Manchester United” has hired a “genius” in the person of Nemany Matic, says Jose Mourinho after midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a victory with a score of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression in the role of a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke through when they wanted.
However, since Matic was not involved in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he seriously lacked preparations for the game, and he withstood only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires revision before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, genius, is how he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare sooner than it’s too late.”
Just like Matic, his comrades-new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main lineup by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but emphasized that the club had already achieved fantastic results, hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I am grateful to the club for having produced three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be more happy if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already tried very hard for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats Persuaded to Stay in the Ruling Coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats, Cheslovas Jurshenas, appealed to fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary newspaper", because of friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and the "Green" - in the Social Democratic Party, a discussion was initiated, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades addressed to fellow party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is clear that the party's comrades' disparity of the election results, but the coalition with the "peasants" created for us, albeit not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided for in the government's program, and to preserve the political domination of the left center over the right-wing parties."
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far “could of emotion-based expression without specific arguments.”
The authors of the letter fear that their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by rash actions.
Disabled Anton Mamaev imposed a fine
The Moscow city court commuted the punishment of a wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand. RUB.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robber and theft of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow city court by its decision mitigated the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand. RUB. Penalty.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the corpus delicti, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," Ulyana Solopova, a spokesman for the Moscow City Court, told Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied st. 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a sentence below the lower limit.
As for the assistant Mamayev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the act and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed by the court’s decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify, intend to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appeals of the sentence in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last fall.
Disabled claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand. RUB, to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, among them a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony. 2 p. 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in jail, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from jail by the decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
ONF to prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, the “frontline” plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the national ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain “deep analytics” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adapts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally is present at the key events of the ONF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that were expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, the interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
The co-chairman of the Central headquarters of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontline” will report to the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the course of the year, we overgrown with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be part of the report, which we train the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontline" will report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he took part in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - Olga Timofeeva added.
The head of the laboratory of regional policy of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI) Andrey Kolyadin noted: when raising environmental issues, the ONF operates in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they, as experts, offered in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out, which can give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental themes was demonstrated by a “straight line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhodka (already developed a bill banning open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further law-enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - said the head of the charity fund "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, Sergei Tsyplenkov, in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary to successfully solve environmental problems, there is little legislative efforts alone.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and car by arm swing
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start a car with a simple flapping of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between the thumb and the index finger and now through his firm, BioTech offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal Winchester, seeking to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northama’s company also replaces locks in homes and machines with a chip for a price of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car “BMW Z4”, which starts when his hand lies on the steering wheel.
White House Requisite Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
According to the military records provided by TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to drive a Marine helicopter to the Southern Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as 24 000 dollars.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One", when the board is the president, became the central element of the event held on July 17 at the White House, which demonstrated American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House top officials inspected technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the Marine Corps First Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for the control of the helicopter, the White House Military Directorate ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South lawn on the occasion of the “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you know you’re aware because it’s an unusual widely public event in the press,” the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an email to his boss, first deputy chief of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the shipment from the White House is delayed, a second crew will need a second crew for a return flight in accordance with restrictions on opening hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security officers of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it remained unclear whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the event contradicts this resolution.
“Among other things, we asked if this is a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it is not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The “Made in America” event was declared by the White House as an official event, and Hatch’s law was not covered.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health care reform at that time in the development of the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask for them is the only one in the interests of the photo possibility is unusual.
Trump was already discussed in February when the presidential plane hit the back track during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was littered with messages with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’s show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House spokeswoman Lindsey Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event “Made in America” was counted on the crew in the account of the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers were not spent on the cost of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company did not take part in the organization of a helicopter demonstration on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Ministry of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the defense defense reimbursement rate for VH-3D is 24,380 US dollars per hour of flight.
The recordings of the unit recorded that the airborne time was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this bet.
“Calking the cost for taxpayers, based on the exemplary rate of compensation, is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These approximate rates include personnel, service, and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allocations.”
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do not take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and the costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of using a helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase the things done in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, if not a thousand people, whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has worked tirelessly so many Americans.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter, inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely slept in a driver’s seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to representatives of the company “Sikorsky”, joking with the press on the topic of his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky well,” the president said. I have three of them.”
Moscow will allocate grants for intensive care units of city hospitals
Every year, grants "Save Life" will be allocated to intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of gratitude to the doctor-traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under the guidance of which a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the foot of a teenager.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital, there are day departments.
The staff of the hospital has 2800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-term stay hospitals (UKP).
They are designed to conduct relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, inpatient medical care was provided to 36 thousand patients in the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
The NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported on the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni to agree on the acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank’s shares was withdrawn.
"There were no documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in the NBU," the report said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Hays, the current head of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the electoral process that coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s election, for the first time, power passes peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hays said that raising the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities tightened fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle through pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
Inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Edit, respect Venice" (#Enjoy RespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in the places of the largest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be held in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser of Venice Paola Mar, information about fines will be transferred to the embassies of the native countries of violators, in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the tourist flow.
In Venice, there is a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100 000 people wishing to watch the festival Festa del Redentore, only 60 000 guests were allowed to take the place of action.
In addition, a moratorium was introduced on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.
Employees of the State Border Service in the first half of 2017 detained 272 illegal immigrants on the border with EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the state border service.

We will remind, in the EU found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz in Skolkovo: experiment and improvisation
The program of the second festival Skolkovo Jazz Science, which will be held on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Guests are expected to perform leading jazz bands and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive platforms and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will become an improvisation territory and a field for demonstrating new creative opportunities.
"The guest of the festival will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovations in science become a new tool for interaction with art," Elena Zelentsova, vice president of the Skolkovo Foundation, described the focus of the forum.
Among the participants of the Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 there are many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, which will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and it is no coincidence that they have united, ”the people’s artist explained to Izvestia.
The experiment and improvisation of jazzmen are valued as highly as scientists.

The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.

Electricity is cheaper for residents, and for producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia), which lasted more than a decade, to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electricity are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Capacity and the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Power) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017. No. 842) set indicative electricity prices and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have beaten the thresholds of the Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with a neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Lake Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year the progress began.
In March, tariffs for electric energy for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of the price zones of the wholesale market, for which the functions of the wholesale and retail markets are established, are the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles for kilowatt/hour.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff movement towards the downward of Buryatia.

National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) Concerns about investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitya’s in connection with its long-term production obligation at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has ignored the issue of future investments on the vegetation site.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, reports that over the past few years has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “lead first about them.”
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded that McVite's reacted to the concern that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the CEO of the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolkross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and on the territory of Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, the East And Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie’s factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the spectacle facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolkros with employees and representatives of GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked with employees that as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our velocity facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkros as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be recognized as the first.
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK threatens the timing of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are continuing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
A member of “La Liga” may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t stop harassing Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record that had been issued three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window, when the Ligue 1 was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogb to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500 000 pounds per week.
It is known that Barcelona is furious about how the proposal was made, and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world not warned of such an opportunity three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a harsh warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players of PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll play against them, we’re going to make offers to their players,” he said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder from PSG Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that it will not let the Italian player go on any terms, and now, probably, Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of a loss of one of his most valuable players, Neumar.
Putin instructed to deal with the payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to understand the material assistance that is allocated to residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, I ask you to report how things are with payments, compensation to the affected citizens.
I have some discrepancies.
"On this occasion, I would also like to ask questions to the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyailo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBI "Glavrybvo" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for dilution.
At first, Putin released a few fry from the net.
Then pulled on a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and an alleged other volume is provided.
“I want to deal with this, what, in fact, is happening there with funding,” the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the settlements of Buryatia, the Irkutsk region were covered with fire, residential buildings and outbuildings were destroyed.
