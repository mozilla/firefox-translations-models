FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert session "Assessing the Effectiveness of the Activities of Scientific Organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editorial office of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the results of the work of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a one-on approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is under approval.
According to the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment, ”said Elena Aksenov, head of the expert and analytical department of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, studied turbulent mixing and its impact on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to look for related among stars, that is, those that have arisen from one cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and briefly on the university’s website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, which is preasted by the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, by its chemical composition, you can determine the place of her birth and the region of formation of stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster can lead to differences in its chemical content from such in relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed the cloud.
This object within a few million years under the influence of its own gravity is converted into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paints-marks to the original gas streams and found that thanks to the rapid turbulent interfering in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to look for stars-relatives in chemical composition, as well as determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrathi's police arrest 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed

George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Narne and Pitlochry
The man will appear in court on charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, has been charged during a high court hearing in Glasgow.
Presumably, he raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
It is claimed that Webster attacked her when she was “out of consciousness, sleeping and unable to give consent.”
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golfview Hotel in Nairna, which is located in the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not “slamming the door” in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “slam the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
Regarding our retaliatory measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, to fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated, ”he said.
And when we will know what European and American partners will be honored at this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be due to the slamming of doors, some grievances, falsely understood, the minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and will draw conclusions from the actions of partners for their adequacy, compulsability and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are seeking, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say in their voice that “they sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do so to punish Russia,” it is probably not very adequate.”
As for the WTO, the release of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the tools of the WTO, including when we talk about trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU’s discriminatory policy towards anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time used anti-dumping measures against the sectors of the Russian economy.
"WE are ready to use the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lilac in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since lilac after fading loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
Moreover, next to the lilac you can and should plant both plants decorative in other terms, and blooming simultaneously with it.
Another plus of lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it a stamped tree of various heights, an improved bush, a wide base bush and even a kind of garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the form that fits the design of your garden more.
In Karelia for the sale of counterfeit money convicted a resident of the Leningrad region
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal craft in the Olonets and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to end the investigation into crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
In the process of investigation, guilt was proved for several episodes of sale of fake money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with serving in a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that last week two more sellers of counterfeit money were convicted, which were paid by them in the stores of Petrozavodsk.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into legal force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73-th anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
"Dervish" delivered military assistance to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the box-based stone to the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
For the first time we gathered twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who were not returned to the sea, ”said Boris Karpov, chairman of the council of veterans of the Northern Shipping Authority.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes presented the veterans with flowers and marching with the flags of Russia and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with laying flowers to the wardrobe.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategically important raw materials (10 000 tons of rubber, 1 500 tons of uniform shoes, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3 800 depth charges and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrickane fighters, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships that took part in vital operations for caravans, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects trade unions as a civil law.
“Where are the unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Progressive Faction Congress.
That is why I am proud to represent the Act of Enhancing the Rights of Employees, along with the symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in discriminating against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade unionists
A change in the Employment Regulatory Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts – and to receive compensation for damages and penalties – a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill offer is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have been subjected to in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo’s paramilitary autocracies was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, and to negotiations, and collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwighte, and his aides, helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler’s fascism had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that employees will need to organize and be heard in a new state, the Germans included an article that openly read: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe on this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at doing so will be recognized as illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drew up the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the compilers included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests”.
Generations have taken for granted the basic provision that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and that this union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies – should be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King the Younger said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the expansion of civil rights to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations – is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis revive the ideals that have historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of Louisiana’s law, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadhl in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who have abortions would have to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital within a 30-mile of practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can currently continue to have legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to take office,” Judge John DeGravells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
Advocates for the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the latter in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately obvious whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in this case, and also applied for admission powers.
Louisiana is part of the 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Opponents of abortions object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the authority to receive a hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for their safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who have abortions while their applications for admission are awaiting decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be of Russian production, said the Deputy of the state Duma from the faction “Fair Russia” Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the Izvestia newspaper writes.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” Nilov said.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves there will be several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Talgatovik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In the plus will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some faster development, contribute to GDP growth will be made.
The dependence of Russia on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately, ”the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises could often not break through the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this niche has been freed and can be sighed.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will arrive on the Russian market.
In other words, now has come the “moment of calm”, when the previous players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products, ”the first Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization Russian Club of Financial Directors, by E.E.N. Tamara Kasyanova.
Definitely, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that, due to subsidies from another state, are cheaper.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the sole laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes, Russian manufacturers are able to satisfy 50% of the internal needs of compatriots not in all articles.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to “get” the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied, ”the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel large retail chains, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer in this scenario, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the second, as for scarce goods.
About the forgotten idea of import substitution in the early 2000-ies, economists again began in February of this year due to the incessant devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers when forming orders to suppliers to reckon with domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time, ”says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impulse can get meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports is maintained by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% falls on Russian products, ”says Kasyanova.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can speed up this process.
However, this initiative itself will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that there will be no full-fledged import substitution, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will be provided, ”the expert says.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women prosing in rural areas of Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghfer Institute for Medical Research said that the probability of dying during the study is 20 percent higher in those who live in the regions and remote areas of the state than those who live in urban areas.
A SMALL STUDY: New Drugs Can Slow Smooth and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers traced the medical path of women to seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer in a later phase at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mostly in big cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elisha Nive, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September in the Kuzhenersky district will open the doors of the new FAP
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaybelak was started in April of this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
There will be medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toreibelak, Shinur and Chashaya.
The new paramedic-obstetric station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
Killed four-month-old son in a drunken state of novocheboksarka will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary completed the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused, together with his four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of the child of his kuma in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the novochebossarka decided to stay away and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a drunk woman put him next to her bed to feed her chest, but soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, the press service of the SU TFR in Chuvashia, is sent to court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp increase in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the MAYAR should make “small, but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the Agency may reduce the assessment of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of incomes of the population.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation involves a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change, ”said the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast a rise in prices in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation rate of 9% will be in February, after which the annual growth rate of prices will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after Russia imposed “neat sanctions”.
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department of FC AForex:
Prices are already rising in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch measures of systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already accountable on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates the price increase.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector from the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressures were under control, the cost of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market due to domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of growth of the inflation component.
If we add here the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsened prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the analytical department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also higher than the current level, it is another matter that then it was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, asset manager of the Magut Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector, this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to protect their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and state regulation.
But rising prices traditionally begin after the summer calm and, perhaps, this autumn will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to end, since Russia still has financial savings.
Horticultural centers are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause horticultural centers to start losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “main age of gardening,” according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent housing spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales of which is estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest spending rate on gardeners on the household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting a dwelling and lack of garden space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Growing plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of horticulture retail trade as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to the better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass purge in the Fund “Agriculture”
Three of the four heads of the Land Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Land Foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal from office of the executive director of Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday quietly were replaced and two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who until that time was responsible for state assistance and the Sapard program, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper “Trud”.
I was not present at the board of fund managers, because by law we are not members of the leadership, but I was later informed that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to know more on Monday,” Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of “Investment Loans” in the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund “Earthly” in the city of Veliko-Tsarnov until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Ataj Aliyev-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat in connection with the message about espionage
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the American attorney-seekers and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier information reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany also made Ankara an intelligence facility, caused a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies have teamed up against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group in China and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (socales, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine) are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of it will own Wanda and 15% each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
It is planned to register the company in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, the number of users of which is about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and amusement theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and make a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce services, the development of which will be engaged in the creation of a competitor to Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, thanks to the merger of Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) of commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest “pie” in online commerce,” Wanda CEO Wang Jianlinn said.
“Now the real O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation, everyone’s chances are approximately equal,” he said.
The Chinese e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that its volume will increase by more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, Bloomberg cites official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number can grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Worst
The head of Tencent, Ma Huatin, until recently, was the richest man in China, however, according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $ 5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion falls on his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Lee now ranks third among the richest people in China, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is the fourth line of the rating.
“This battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge an even richer man,” said the director of the Chinese e-commerce research center in Hangzhou Cao Lei.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation: “Roman cannot be built in one day.”
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only with new companies, but also the honored leaders of the world e-commerce, is evidenced by the report on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period is almost twice the same combined indicator of competitors - it has grown almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $ 1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has tremendous potential to generate money, largely due to its mobile applications,” said A case-based analyst at the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba Avenue on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter accounted for mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $ 187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The company’s road-show, which preceded this event, starts on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba’s IPO will be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
Until now, the record for the volume of funds raised on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion on this.
At least half of food products in retail chains should be of Russian production, according to deputies of the state Duma.
They drafted a bill on this topic.
It is about making changes to article. 8 Federal Law "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a “discount” will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law introduces a change to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law was introduced into the lower house of parliament on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive farm markets in Russia, in which small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Charged with Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Kalvia police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous center of unbridled drunken Magalufe.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was placed in custody as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street, which houses most of Magalouf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia in the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the National Guards of Spain in connection with allegations of corruption and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied owners of nightclubs say protectionism from the authorities is seriously affected by the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
It is impossible to jeopardize our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalouf was in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, which featured an 18-year-old British vacationer who made blowjobs to 24 men during the bar race.
The authorities of the island have since been trying to stop hooliganism in a state of intoxication among the vacationers of Magaluf, minimizing the number of infamous alcohol races on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident occurred with a blowjob, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bars together were fined € 55000 ($73000).
The tourist resort of Magalouf, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the site of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic intoxication associated with insane fun known as “balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRing has prepared a cold surprise in the south of South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city in the evening to 9 pm, after 6.6 mm, which fell over the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm, which began shortly before 8 p.m and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave an early portion of spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
Squalive conditions are supposed to be one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into the wind shift area - a sudden change in the speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and was forced to gain height.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused a subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rainstorms.
Calculation of the estimate of construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connecting to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
The FAS has created an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the Department of Housing and Communal Services, Construction and Natural Resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they propose the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of design solutions instead of the estimated norms and single prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals are included in the roadmap and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
"Replacing the traditional estimate documentation in construction by calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyov explained to RGB.
After all, now every bolt and nut are counted in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupted construction companies can bury “whole tractors”.
In the Ministry of Construction with the FAS agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost on structural elements are already there: methods have been developed to calculate the prices of design solutions, the compilation of estimates for these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told "RSB", the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been proposed to business.
“As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings,” he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert Community of State Order Professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director for engineering of the Rosatom industry center of capital construction, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and to companies that own monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximally enriched from someone’s influence manager.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state orders in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
In the Ministry of Construction believe that this approach should be evaluated from the point of view of the impact on the business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of the customer and budget expenses for its maintenance.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will have knowledge that allows you to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to disinterest in obtaining a state order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Procurement Institute Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game for the attentiveness of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "the participant in filling out the application must indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or the equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "name", "analogue", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "below", "both", "could", "maybe", "maybe", "previously", "previously", "not above", "not allowed".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess at the stage of filing the quality of work through the “paper” proposal of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of work, the implementation of which has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of work can be assessed only when accepting them.
The expert council was also asked to move the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors disappeared.
Chairman of the expert council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the well-known reception of Arkady Raikin "Atelele": "Does there be claims to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and rainfalls fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was recovering from the fighting.
The beginning of school classes brought a sense of joy and unrest to the settlements of southern Israel affected by the rockets, but traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashos kindergarten, which hit the rocket, removed the traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the arrival of students.
“We are a little scared, but we are looking to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly to start going to school again “a little strange.”
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of border settlements, such as Sa'ad, did not go outside or left their homes, leaving in safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the border with Gaza, where a fragment of a Palestinian mine was killed by a 4-year-old boy, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderoth, a city on the border with Gaza, which was greatly indignant from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to learn diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, for example, Hamas's demand for the removal of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and bring back the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it did not provide substantial evidence to support the claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan militants fired 4591 units of missiles and mines at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fighting continued, officials in charge of education last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
“I hope the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children around the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to the popular criterion, property prices showed the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase in June, July and August by 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases were 10.9 percent, more than twice as high in 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are in the two-level market.
Figures RP Data show that in Sydney, house prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne - by 11.7 percent.
The next in terms of capacity of the markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was followed by government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring began, there will be an increase in the number of real estate items for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high level of auction sales, the overall high sales speed and current conditions with a low interest rate are likely to rise in the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold mines and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Bolshaya Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century from the time of construction has not changed, except for the old age.
Strangers go here as a tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
The old yard, always open door, a creaking staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the lumens from the peeled plaster in some places is visible.
It seems that everything is based on an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think so," "You don't think so."
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the XVIII century, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on state protection, but money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poor and stabbing, but the foundation is all rotting.
Many tenants still go to the toilet in the street, and are washed once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied with such conditions?
The road passes directly under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pushes the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows there is a flow of cars.
You see, the glasses are rattling constantly, the windows can not open, and the noise is accustomed.
A person gets used to everything, to the good and the bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Moreover, two rooms are with us, living in three with our son.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general ceilings a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live: my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
I've been here since birth, there's never been another living space," Lyudmila's eyebrows' room: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "g"; one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water supply system is no good.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment routinely and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian, whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a wrap and a toilet from a former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family apartment, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the real estate center of Ufa they say that privatization does not matter.
Still, we get only a one-bedroom apartment, we can not claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to reset us, but it did not go beyond the promises.
Not accustomed to complaining and I will not.
In this apartment (room!) A whole dynasty lived: my grandparents, my mom and dad, I and my daughter and my granddaughter.
Anything has happened during that time.
For example, heavy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are a meter thickness!
They say the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thanks to Demidov!
Probably that's why so far no one has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or a thug.
Only the building still slowly dies in front of our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors have repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say that it is - under our room secret climb and a move to the White River, which the old people who once once lived here were specially made so that you can hide from the danger, in case of what.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start in the excavation apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for one on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are we four-night in one?
And here at least there is a tiny hope that they will give housing more spaciously.
If we had agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the Starostin family did not win anything.
The biggest dream of Lyudmila to be resettled, and the daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-bedroom apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins in which two generations live now.
A cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two cramped rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You see what conditions.
Plaster falls off with pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms end-to-end holes.
The water in the faucet is only cold all year round.
Having walked through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can see that the most of all the spouses Lavrentyev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's a lot of space!
A room of 75 squares, prescribed three people.
We live just in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
Ceilings are high, spacious.
One is bad - everything around cracks at the seams, falls apart, collapses.
Neighbors have already told you!
Most of all the torment in our country with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally left from under the feet.
I put up the jerk, wedges; there is nothing in the hall, and in the other room we walk, like we swing, so shaky.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The gold industry treats as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, casting cannons and bells, holding Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 40-ies of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard boxes, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something prevented...
The story repeated in 2014: again beckoned with new housing.
We, as on command, collected all the documents, ran away the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that moving to apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something no longer believes in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, a piece of paper was issued without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants."
I even have such a feeling that our house has long been out of the city, because at first it was at number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had already been demolished in the 70’s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the management on land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
House on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I can’t be responsible for the actions of officials of the 70’s, but I know that at that time there was a plan for the demolition of all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses along the street of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, is successfully fulfilled.
Residents are soon planned to be relocated to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now an architectural biennale is held in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire Old Kazanskaya street will be restored, the official said.
The houses will acquire a proper appearance corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov is likely to be a museum open to everyone.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on the weekend of a pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work out, too much congestion of roads in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to settle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye because of a thunderstorm began a forest fire
Dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting District Forestry in the Pozharsky district of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, a build-up of the grouping of forces and means is underway.
According to the leadership of the KSBU "Primorsky Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
The fire, which arose in a hard-to-reach area, was detected by a pilot-observer from the Ahn-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burn wood residues on the old burner.
The severe clutter of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable for landing firefighting paratroopers create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
A Mi-8 helicopter is needed.
The delivery of force at the disposal of the airbase by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, 4 parachutists-firefighters were quickly planted at the site of the extinguishing.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare a site for the delivery of additional forces and means of fire extinguishing.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Okhotnyye, an additional 3 paratroopers-firefighters were delivered by helicopter.
As soon as the site for landing a helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children born to the family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudelly in the weeks of the House in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, was working in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Roody's Rare's Rare's, which is partly based on an imagined conversation with his father and grew up from a series of programs on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of ruggie and rap, and melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, there was a “many” treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice, "Cease to make noise.
Get off your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unstoppable guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions became better than in his father’s days, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
Now there is a little better, but these are dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father climbed in the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash away from the foundry shop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing it for years and years to make money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked in childhood.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom
They are still great friends with French, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the ones that killed her.
So when I got very, very well-recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to take drastic action.
Then I started a serious fictoset, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry’s career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in the theater.
Comedy of Errors followed and then Ogast Wilson's Fences.
This work is different from the satkoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed how he parodies on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces".
His career on television began in the mid-seventies: “For quite a long time I was the only black parodist/comedian on television.”
He studied at work.
I not only had to grow in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to Black and White Menstrelet Show, a light entertainment program in which people “bringed their face,” Henry found himself to be in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I don't think I want it to ever be with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked at large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “received by the award-winning easy entertainment classics on British television and years” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”
Representing the characters who mocked the culture of blacks in the UK and glorifying it, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gerette Blacklock from the comedy series The Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, television series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit that you're pulling time or slowly turning to the side."
Next was a series of documentary programs on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
It is impossible to say that I was really taught this in school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the bottom in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench said, “You have to try.
Don't scold that before you know what you're talking about.
Say aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he got hooked.
I got a feeling that I could do that.
It's like my head was straightened out.
“This is what it is, it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play months and months before we staged it.
And she was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn’t happen.
We soon started the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I'm at the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
“A quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes for them to fix the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something in me said, “Oh, thank God.”
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Fences" at the Dachess Theater
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Fences".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing: "That's what you need to do."
He says it in a THICK voice.
So I'm holding on.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's thinking - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts, then ends parody.
I just decided not to work in stand-up because this thing with an instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you're looking for it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work in "Live in Apollo" when I want, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he's gonna give a stand-up tour sometime.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps to give shape to the beginning, middle and end of the way - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
Is that his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here is a great place for this.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to cut corruption in government after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700000) per month is lost by paying “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebushiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear within the next two weeks to the identification centers to ensure that their data are collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government statement said.
Anyone who does not do this without a valid reason will be deleted from the payroll, according to it.
“This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government – therefore, will put an end to the problem of “invisible workers,” said Anne Weiguru, secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Government Planning and Structure.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with the “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government”, according to local news agencies.
Police did not comment on this information immediately.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daly News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which was aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power to the Islamic clergy Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was not held at every school.
There is no peace of the sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the heavens.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, which went to the daughter of Yatsenyuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally noted by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the person of Rona Feirhead BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs
She is followed by a plume of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at the consulting firm on global management Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a high post at the parent company Pearson’s was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he was trying to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but its structure has an inner paradox.
The board has two directions: inside as the top level of the BBC’s management hierarchy itself, but also outward as the voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopomia, which needs a complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman will risk coming, trambling and destroying the institute as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he deprives himself of the work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t be that difficult, a lot of people will be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing her powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow circles and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the cost of the license are a special danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 per year, the British acquire a share in, definitely the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that the results of her work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today against 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and use models have changed: I’m now getting news headlines on my mobile phone and watching the missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry of Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone outsiders
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting portrayal of the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the record was disavowed.
Just from my account, a tweet was posted, which was written by someone outsiders.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," the late record reports.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to reports with a request to comment.
Although the records were uploaded from Perry’s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing in this tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of District Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption reads: “I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication, 3 times higher than the permissible level of alcohol in the blood. But when I do that, I charge Governor Perry for telling me.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the accusations a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge leading the case to reject the indictment, saying that the law that is used to prosecute a governor who has performed his duties longest in the history of Texas is vague, which is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state’s state’s public control division, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto caused an official complaint from the group of public control, which has left-wing views.
The latent confirmed Perry account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at the party congress in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could leave the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running next to the lake, and the words: “Here are we, South Carolina!”
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a “normal state”
One of London’s most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital were subject to lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread concerns that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s elite construction company, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction level since the peak of 2013,” adding that it provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Earth cadastre, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 percent in England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes Berkeley rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the pound’s strengthening in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped introducing new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “manual tax” before the general election next May.
London’s real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, under which tighter loan conditions were introduced, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate purchase and sale transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Latest data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast for the rise in prices for London real estate for 2015 to 3% based on the fact that the mood of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to the agency WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital was very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and the best location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the deadlines remain.”
In June, the company said it had sold 3742 new homes this year by the end of April, almost a third of more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual tax earnings rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley said that Berkeley’s estimated revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a profit is expected for the whole year before taxes of £ 450 million.
The value of Berkeley shares was held on £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85-th ceremony of the annual Academy Award.
Photos of the nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a “catalogue” of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and denounced the hacker for “brazen invasion of personal space.”
Law enforcement was contacted, and they will be haunted by anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, presumably due to a lack of Apple iCloud’s online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the burglary victims includes the names of a dozen female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Alsten, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. Ally” Winstead also condemned the hack.
“Those who look at the photos that my husband and I made a few years ago, secluded at home, I hope you are proud of yourself,” Winsted wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickloodeon series “iCarly” and “Victorious Victoria” denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: “These so-called photos of my fALSOVIKIES, people.
Let me stop it in the bud. *Portable *.
Buzzfeed said last Sunday that the pop star Ariana Grande has denied that the photos in which, presumably, it is authentic.
Exclusive excerpt from the new novel by Howard Jacobson about the love and the letter "J", which caused the praise of critics
They dissolved, it is best to say exactly, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box that they left in the rain.
Only sometimes the woman told him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and, perhaps, a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was tie-on, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorny was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and, perhaps, even some satisfaction.
Eylinn Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with broken hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion over herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a damp but similar to a paradise of the valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one has lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, spiders sat in the baths motionless, the sliders left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden overgrown with weeds, similar to giant cabbage heads.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and charming, with a full secret of the garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the Longlist of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kavern and Eilenn sat, holding hands, in broken sun lounges among the tall grass, enjoying unexpectedly warm springspring day; they both severedly connected to the cheap console, which supplied the country with peaceful music and soothing news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long ago.
You have too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer played.
They were not banned - nothing was actually forbidden - they just did not lose.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word "archaic".
The public taste did what could never be achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, from all the music they chose ballads.
Grattered this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing the big legs of Eileenn with a rough comic voice.
Einen didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist's song called Fats Waller," he told her, having machinedly two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she flies off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forgetting to put two fingers to your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun right now.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eylinn never heard him.
Jazz was also not played, although he was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” place in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Watness in the same way.
His unpredictability was on the nerves of people.
And jazz was a wit, expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never hearing about Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from the father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Immigrants from Hindustan, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took up so that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was engaged in plenticycles; what remained of the Greek was beaten by plates.
The people from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when WHAT HAPPENED, IF EVEN HAPPENED, in fear that they would be accused of inciting the flames, in fear, in fact, that the flame would swallow them next, opened restaurants with labes and hookahs, did not fore.
Everyone by ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eilenn was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kavern had just sung could be put to music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Maybe it's for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate through the sound insulation of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eylin didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he did not want to press her two fingers to her again.
She already thought he was strange.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Keverver review.
In the whole world there was nothing but a digit of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he wanted to see.
"Oh, if you say that," she said, staying in front of her.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
It seemed to be really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you just because you have thick ankles," he tried to say it instead.
I have that kind of perversion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him to an awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty that had hidden in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eilenn Solomons blushed and got up from the sun lounger, overthrew the console and the spill of the wine they drank.
Wine from the elderberry, so intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said.
Even though you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her gaze when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main features she was like the local ones.
The same huge ice ocean hit them both.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after the Fact That HAPPENED, IF IN GENERAL THERE HAPPENED, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered into furious from a pub to a pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First, they would kiss - the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh ballads, which the console gave - first to kiss her, and then hit her.
Excessive clarification, according to Ceveron, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed that he needed to leave.
He got up from a sun lounger like an old man.
She herself felt a lead heaviness, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she looked at how he left, her companion is a man who took burdens himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and men in general, although some of them raised her hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with a bent back, shamed, battled, all the ability to fight left him - why did it seem to her that she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen this?
Again, Eileen Solomons, looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or so Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the "Offnau", the unofficial Public Sentiment Control Service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not stop at all, given the means and forces that have been allocated for his eradication.
"A lot has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow straps of the area, where, despite the studs of studs of churches, the gentle breath of human kindness was rarely felt throughout history.
However, some qualities are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it originates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcoming obstacles and declares its fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that a new and vicious bullying in houses, in the workplace.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” said her supervisor, after reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nusbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call “evil” and “gross” yourself, others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to bore what happened, IF IT HAPPENED AT OUR GENERAL, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind his head are pink, like flamingos, LED letters repeated the tips that “Onnau” gave to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
The conversation is better than silence, the word of the song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you want to say,” said Esme Nussbaum quietly when I made sure that her supervisor had finished talking, “and I don’t want to say anything other than that we were not cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that initially led to what happened, IF HAPPENED AT OUR TIME.
Only this time we will throw away our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the fingertips into the pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “ascerning the ‘mistakes’ of the actions that our grandfathers did or have not committed.
You go too far and when you say they threw their “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that, understanding the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There were no "us" and there were no "others".
It was a time of mess, that's all we know.
“For which, to be honest with themselves,” dared to insert Esme, “no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, then it was done.
It was then then.
There's nothing else to say, we agree.
And just as you don’t have to blame anyone, don’t make excuses if it were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past is that we forget it.
If I can add one word to it -
The Pyramid of Luthera Rabinowitz fell apart.
"I'll review your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, “in malicious rage.”

Lesotho's army says coup was not planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Lesotho’s army officials denied the fact of preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying they acted against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and had seized government buildings in Maseru's capital.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he was threatened with an assassination attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Nethlee Ntoi said there was no coup, in fact, but that the army reacted to the threat from the “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Force has taken action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clyson Mongiela said the army looked like a coup.
“Although no one has filed claims to seize power by force, according to all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Representatives of the army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that in the capital calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motezhoa Metsing manages the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho is very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its unified government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite the accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he went on the field as part of the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier “Milan” rented from “Liverpool” striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest in 13 months
The growth of production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest figure in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the index of business activity (PMI) of the production sector of the eurozone on Markit fell to the level of 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and businesses have suffered among the growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
Meaning came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan on how to cope with the eurozone’s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB leader Mario Draghi could give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level of 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that the momentum of growth has faded mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire to analysts expecting the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best way to say about the August study of the Eurozone’s manufacturing sector business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “The manufacturers of the eurozone are obviously finding a very difficult life at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially Russia-Ukraine-related – adds to the uncertainties in many countries.
This increased tensions have obviously hit the business — and especially consumer confidence, and is likely to cause some orders to delay or even cancel, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like the fact" that the ECB, of course, will have to carry out some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will put a human chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are terrified to be the arrival of the “militaries”.
According to political scientists, the separatists break through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupol members decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but its forces are a little against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LNR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a pressing chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, stores are gradually closing, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten years of hell for survivors of Beslan: Ten years with a terrible school capture, like children who were in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom are children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during school atrocities
Exactly ten years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, who heroically survived the disaster warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in the aversion, which surprisingly then escalated into action and hope for the future in conditions of heavy grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during school atrocities.
We found amazing young people who resisted trouble, although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war, which is now tormenting Ukraine, in which the same children as they die, will now stop.
The girl who in the photo is trying to get back into the at-fired gym
It is captured in a picture of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one linen tried to climb back into the shelled sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In confusion, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run away with all my might, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked it up and took it to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
There's been a few shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people as the doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with challenge.
“It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, although the memories fade slightly each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and from everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I climb into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy and make sure that this does not happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years old) and survived three days of capture, hugged his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw the crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said: “Damier told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out of the way and was in the hospital with wounds on her feet, in turn thinking that her son was killed.
After their reunion, she said, “I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now the non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the Advocate of Children from the Barnardo’s Foundation, Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“That horror comes back to you every day, but I’d like me to stop remembering him,” he said yesterday.
I can still say that he fads in my memory.
I remember how immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapon.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard, who never got out of here.
We never say they are murdered or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and a trip in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like me to stop remembering him
“I’m so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who last week was engaged in volunteer work at the convent.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope that I will be enrolled in the educational academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the creepy silence right after the capture, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Shery Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think this world has not gotten better over these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
It's just the same kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not angry.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not fixated on this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
Didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember screaming to him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on to us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: surviving Beslan Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right George today
On his bloodied face there was an imprint of fear when he escaped from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of study before driving Vladimir’s eldest son to the university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The West is in the soul: a photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking shots of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember that George so wanted to go to school that day that he said that he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the crying George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It is important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens, because if people ask, no one wants war, so does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to go through decades to forget her a little.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years old I had nightmares about capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I continue to go to this gym before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgy Farniyev, 20 years
The boy who survived, despite the fact that he was at the feet of a terrorist-killer
Incredible: Georgy Farniyev was at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” says George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I am older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events, I have to say that this is not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year, was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniyev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still, health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, “I know I’ll never tell my kids about my experience.
It’s not what children need to know about, and certainly not what they have to endure.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and attend the ceremonies to be held to mark it.
I know George won't work.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there and I didn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but can’t play sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could make me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know the families where new children were born, but I also know the widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed a lot.
If it were possible to grab all the rebels and throw away, as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby, who touchingly took to a safe place a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alena Tskayeva carries a Russian special forces fighter (online) to a safe place.
Now she is ten (right), and she does not remember at all about the monstrous crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a little Alyona was carried out from a captured school in Beslan, a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister Christina and Mahar’s brother in the gym of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alyona’s mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has been remarried since then, and they have and his new wife Svetlana has a young daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of his daughter, whom he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing of the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he is looking forward to when he will be able to go on the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play again for Borussia”, – quotes Bild words Kagawa.
I feel very good.
It’s full of positive emotions and I’m looking forward to going back to go back to the Borussia.
Kagava moved to Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he could not gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the championship of England in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man accused of hitting a girl on a pedestrian crossing “peal” in Fife
78-year-old man will appear before the court on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing “pelikan” in Faifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the passage in Pittenvin in East Newka.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart had driven his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and hit the girl, resulting in injury.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in the Duffy Court of Sheriff.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, has set the date for the trial for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be sold out in Vladivostok
The Duty-free Duty Shop Duty Free of Vladivostok has posted a sign banning to make purchases in this store to a number of world political leaders.
Do not give them perfumes, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to get vodka, cognac and perfumes in their store.
And hung the corresponding sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance of an institution in an even less accessible service to him - Diocines of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president has loved the dream of ever eating in a diet canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Whether there is cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand among buyers.
The Council was given during a visit to the enterprise "Ygptycerm" company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also gave the council to restaurate the restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All Sport" words of Maslakov.
Third place - confirmation of our fairly high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans above us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DenaNation match.
In recent years, we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the team.
The French, on the contrary, put up a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians spoke in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were much lower than the Diamond League.
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is no longer so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the point of absurdity, when at 1500 m, men were so fond of tactical intricacies of running, which showed the result below the average level. Women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality of underwater photographs and videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot video underwater, you have a number of hardware options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof “soapbox”, for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or action camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $ 300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for a price of about $ 350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’ll shoot.
Some photo and video cameras have shooting or object type that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can fall.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer’s guide and digital camera rankings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take off a few shots - because many of them will not work.
The "rows" have a LCD that will help you to compose pictures, while action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an DM, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
Take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode, which shoots several frames with a few different exposure settings, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more colors in the photos; the deeper you go, the less the color you will see.
Swim closer to the objects of the shooting.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it is even more important under water due to darkened light conditions.
It is especially important if you shoot on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the subject objects if you want to fill out the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling Bilyal Mach can go into the Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan in freestyle wrestling Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is at the training camp of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" words Sazhid Sazidov.
In general, Bilyal performed in both styles of juniors.
At the 2005 Youth World Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize-winner in the Greco-Romans competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
It has long been said that our heavyweight will spend a new stage in the Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can perform already at the World Cup in Tashkent - if he wins an estimate.
But the decisive word is always for the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality might have shaken everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
Counseling anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to rid the sick of both the suffering of the disease and the flour of the treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalls, was an officer MI-6 who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors were passionate about diagnoses and illnesses, those who were undergoing treatment, mainly worried about something completely different, pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel as usual,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found that he irritatedly reproaches his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet went on business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and incomprehensible why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to take a chest x-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results are here.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the pulmonary membrane.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma differently.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called “mirace,” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesolithoma is a disease that you can not pay attention to.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960’s, when the advisory industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulation, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here, more people die from mesoteloma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality of about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and the projected number of deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have been ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually take decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, is embedded in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, level of prosperity, profession or age.
Bastions of the elect, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.
The parliament building is permeated with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He was not a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in Guy’s hospital, where I spent six years in an internship,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and movers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who trained at Guy’s hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I’m alone alive.”
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesotelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to leading mesotheliome expert in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in the UK should survive itself, about 9000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

Quick review of reports from the courtrooms, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotells attack spread.
This June, for example, the Marks & Spencer admitted that Janes Ellen was subjected to contact with asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before this happened," she says, "I've never heard of Mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think it would hurt me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings to date.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (abose) and blue asbestos (crocydolate).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are a strong, albeit indirect reason to believe that this is the main reason for an exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK].”

Janes Ellen may haven’t thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Piot’s work suggests her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the “normal use and weather impact” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical silos and pipelines behind the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be driven by something so harmless as “strong air streams.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Directorate for Maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitary certificate”, it has now recognized that it is necessary to carry out £1 billion in the reconstruction of the parliament, improving the electrician and retracting asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election of 2015, members of parliament may be sitting in the QE2 conference center nearby, and not on the green becks.
Goddard’s report noted that “the asbestos situation was not governed by different rules.”
It is impossible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who never managed to identify his contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he was in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that was successfully filed with asbestos-related lawsuits,” he says, “But I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places where it worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that was like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the last night.
Suddenly I started to be feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't get all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janes Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect the mesothelioma.
In the end, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took x-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it for tests.
And yet his condition was left without a diagnosis.
Gradually, his health condition improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he played sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to him in the reception with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not associate it with his own case.
Eventually, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again, and the doctor who advised him showed his results of a CT and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and the New Year: “I was told that this is mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom offered him to contact a lawyer.
That’s when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick with the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients were injured.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly actually exposed to a toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, in theory, life was saved for the creditors, but a place that posed a life-threatening to the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Students installed their burners of Bunsen on asbestos
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its amazing insulating and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
As a matter of fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos in the class for the first time.
Across the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Burials of Bunsen on asbestos.
Websites have emerged to address asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such innocuous things as floor tiles or shell roofs tended to contain asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970-ies.
So be careful when you wear garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes quite a long time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas anymore
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the position of the patient.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he was baffled by the amount of information to be accepted.
“It was hard to realize,” he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?
I was given about 12 months.
I remember I thought, "Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas again.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, since it is the mechanics of how we maintain life – the very act of breathing – that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbeste is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers inhale, they can get stuck in the pleura, the shell of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem occurs due to inhalation of needle asbestos fibers," Professor Tom Tragerer, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, leading the center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed while internging in the hospital.
When the asbestos pebbles enter the lung tissue, the Thruger says, “breathing they push them to the periphery, where the shell is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
Common treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot spores.
Some people think it’s worth trying.
The meter does not agree.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to approach around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is “not very good at chemotherapy” that “acts” but does not cure.
"Time from time there are sick who live for a long time," says the Threubian.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a support and consultation bureau for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and would extend his life for only a month.
"I was in despair," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “has managed to give everything a somewhat more positive color.”
Meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally inevitable ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - about the future of families that they will leave.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson has contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“I’ve known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960’s is what it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That’s when we started talking about the unscrupulousness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn’t a “full-value resolution,” Morgan said, as Lawson failed to unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos in Guy Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, a representative of the hospital, Guy, confirmed, however, that “asbestos in the basements in question were removed in the 1990’s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, to bind lethal contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - was a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that the time is on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been issued that facilitates the diseased person with mesothelioma recovery of compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
According to this law, the £350 million fund of funds funded by the insurance industry was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case - about £120000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesotelioma, believes that £ 350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if they had not intervened in the time period and patients with mesotelomema could track companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, previously a minister of labor and pensions, admitted that the law is “immaculate.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, a quick action was needed.
“People suffer so much and they need help today,” Penning said during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelyomes last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loicky Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasurer, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasts as much as 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“This is, of course, one of the most important things,” says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans did not show a trace of the disease.
Then I was scand in March [2014].
There were a few stains [cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or what to show my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you get bleak.
We have to look ahead.
As Ellie’s father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, isn’t always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and what to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many people called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all patients have to face cancer.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by the hope, even the glimpse of the opportunity to survive.
This disease carries with it (even as, as, as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a gloomy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing in a matter of hours after this statement.
The decision of the National People’s Congress, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t betray our expectations, but it’s still infuriating our law,” said lawmaker Emily Lau, Democratic chairman.
That’s not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
While defending China’s decision, Li Fey, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said it would be too “chaotic” to allow the popular nomination for election for the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when the UK passed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to choose the head of government by vote since 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kong people the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in their hands with the help of a candidate nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years.
Behind a large part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has threatened to close the Hong Kong financial district if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise in waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, obviously seeking to avoid problems with state bodies.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “wived the possibility of capturing the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are deeply saddened to announce that all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the central area will undoubtedly take place.
State authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing’s announcement for several days, and security measures were stepped up at the government headquarters on Sunday with the involvement of police and barricades.
At the heart of the riots is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
The fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are also growing, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying his demonstrations are putting business at risk, Hong Kong’s source of life.
“The protest they are talking about, it can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said lawmaker Regina Hip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a representation that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also given reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown by saboteurs sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which attracted 78000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American culture of graduation balls reaches university life: freshmen were asked to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first luxury travel service in the UK for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to how this year’s students will help students get to the university with a minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that since this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that “students will begin to order this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite the fact that students should pay for the training of £9000 per year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what is needed for this.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NCC’s vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants does not keep up with the rapidly growing costs of basic needs, before they can start thinking about taking thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival in the dormitory.
Feminists raise the question of racial and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, Miriam blogger Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
From her experience, white feminists who left comments put a gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted nationwide attention, Peres saw the answers of white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as “thoughts about Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to race, they felt that it should be pointed out.
For an English professor at Ohio Corita State University, Mitchell Ferguson has exposed the challenges that black American women face every day, but who are not perceived as “women’s problems” in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence stuns.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women, as Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues related to race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream mainstream, Angela Hatteri, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors were done the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10000 black men lyceumed, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
I needed a white woman confirming the story to substantiate lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragecists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800’s and saw that the struggle for the right to vote would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later,” said Hatteri.
The view back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women do not trust white women.
We've done nothing good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lychevization in the Association of Women of the South for the Prevention of Litch.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of the reactions of white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the problems that black women coped in several generations.
“Is it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child just as seriously as they treat the right to contraceptive?” asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinham, two weeks after the assassination of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests on racism.
“I hope that women who have another, but a similar reason to understand the danger in the body – and the points of view on racial problems that differ significantly in public surveys – will be at the head of the change,” wrote Stein.
Although Steinham is vouching for a more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments about the race in America still surprise some.
The researcher of the American entrepreneurship institution, Christina Sommers, the author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, “much are more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Stein’s remarks about Ferguson are contrary to criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “My Mother’s Watchman” to help vulnerable blacks and Spanish-speaking boys, was followed by an angry reaction from many feminists, including from Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. border guards arrested about 63000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again – this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present this problem as an important thing for women, she only needed to share stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued [to male immigrant], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are resonating with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich House "with a pig" for sale
The photo of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
Put up for sale for £120000, a separate one-bedroom house is on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with a head lying on the couch.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"Howly, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been deleted," the company's spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as “a unique single-dance home.”
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in promotional materials.
Selling a house aroused interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open, lost to Caroline Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to adequately end the year and try to reach a new level, Vasily OSIPOV reports from New York.
How will you generally appreciate your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I am glad that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even reach the quarter-finals.
What tasks do you set for yourself before the end of the season?
After an insulting defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have something to work on, and I am going to do my best to finish a year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed for the implementation of the GTO norms to give bonuses when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pull-up, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement from September 1 on its territory the norms of the TRP.
I also offered the students who passed the TRP to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, you can add points to the exam a little.
There are also proposals to give an additional day off to employees of enterprises who have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A player in the lottery from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being searched southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday night.
The newsstand in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, the last winnings amounted to $ 1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
The owner of the shop, Steve Forward, said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city talks about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought such a win could have been secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winnings of the main prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, following the huge $7.5 million win of the pair from Belmont just a few weeks before.

A billionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners of the main prize in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $ 85 million.
The Ministry of economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the market of electric vehicles
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said the deputy director of the department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the round table, which was held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas engine fuel in Russia already has.
The plan (there is a copy of Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
It is the need to develop criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport and decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals for reducing the price of machines, stimulating localization and creating service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015. it is planned to amend regulatory legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to do in 2015. to formulate proposals for the regional authorities so that they also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with the advantage of driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016. - and proposals for expanding public procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014. will make criteria in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia is only forming - in 2013. Approximately 100 electric vehicles have been sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014. the import duty on electric vehicles has been reset, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts the chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the fivefold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013. In Russia, according to the Association of European Businesses, 278 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars into Russia.
Renault is being prepared to start import - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Nicolas Remiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships of Renault in Russia.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has and Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the release is meager.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of AvtoVAZ for engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support for a breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (fuels - units), sighs the general director of "AUTsTA" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain the niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Avtorevu Mikhail Podorozhinsky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that “electromobility” is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes Wolfgang Schlimme, president of the BMW group in Russia.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will appear soon.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the Rosseti department, Vladimir Sophin, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, the ability to do so with regard to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia to zero customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
The replacement of the transport tax with the environmental (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentive measures are needed for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as have already been made in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
In Colorado crashed a private plane
A single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport of the city of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are being established.
In the Donetsk region, they deal with captured militants of the Donbass battalion.
Punishers were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were loyal to their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the southeast of Ukraine really would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Publers from the battalion "Donbass" survived after the "meat grinder", in which they fell near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to get out of the “ring” along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally in a couple of minutes, shells and bullets were witching from all sides.
“Judging by the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to get out,” says the acting. deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we went down between the Multipole and Chervonoselsky, crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, from “zeils”, grenade launchers of 30-millimeter, automatic cannons of BMD, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three in the back, as a result, there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign “Lermontov” says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
Surviving militants are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called “terrorists” treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to the right death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
A column, the entire battalion to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news they talked about the atrocities that allegedly repaired in the south-east "separatists".
Alex saw a completely different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed - and not someone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, said that there is a mortar shelling, which is most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from the training camp with Zurakhovo.
According to the prisoners, in the “cauldron” near Ilovaisk stuck 300-350.
Now some survivors admit that if it were possible to turn back time, they would never have joined the punitive battalion for nothing.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR law enforcement forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a headquarters was established to limit the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a headquarters has been created, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products in the region market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive authorities and supervisory authorities.
All together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev compensate Rosneft $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lysychansk refinery in Ukraine at $ 140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We are assessing the damage of $ 140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichansky refinery modernized by the company was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no battles, there were no “enveloped rebels”, but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared,” he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery, a tank for storing oil storage burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansky Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as batches of diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012. Oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its unprofitability.
It was decided to start repairs at the company.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichinsky Refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
As told “Interfax” in the joint Committee of chiefs of staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
The ruble falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow stock exchange, the dollar increased at the opening of 3 kopecks. to 37.15 rubles, the ruble decreased to the bi-currency basket against the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trading on the ETS on the dollar started with transactions in the boundaries of 37.11-37.2 rubles / $ 1, on average for two minutes, the rate was fixed at 37.16 rubles / $ 1, this is 4 kopecks. higher than the level of the previous closing.
The euro exchange rate was 48.79 rubles. for 1 euro, it's 3 kopecks. higher than the level of the previous closing.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The U.S. dollar is trading on 23 kopecks. above the official rate, the euro - for 16 kopecks. above the official course.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
He continued to get cheaper and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing back the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia in advance.
However, so far it is more like artificial hysteria, bloated through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not many options for the introduction of new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues a sharp weakening against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, and Russian indices, and the position of the national currency may adjust.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be sued with "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" filed "Ideal-tour" lawsuits for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, the meetings on which will be held in October.
The cases will be considered by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its amount is a little more than 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was submitted on August 18.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 2.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union of travel industry, judges in cases are appointed different.
In July, the media reported on the debts of “Ideal-tour” to “Orenburg Avilines” in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
General Director of the airline Viktor Zyukin says about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
General Director of "Aeroflot" Vitaly Savelyev calls an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the process of registering users to quickly involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service at once to make their own read circle immediately.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated during registration.
In this case, Twitter automatically sets a tick to a subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to personally remove the ticks in order not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is associated primarily with the continuing attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the user base and a drop in the activity of readers.
The company at the moment desperately needs more consumers loyal to the resource, who, having gone in, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising tools.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, according to meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the suburbs - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy with clearing weather, there will be rain in places, the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The program of recycling resumed from September 1
Since September 1, the program for the disposal of cars is resumed in Russia.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car up to 350 thousand rubles per truck.
Previously, a similar program of recycling cars was already in force in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is supposed not only to dispose of cars to obtain a subsequent discount, but also an opportunity if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one at a discount when the old one is handed over to the "trade-in" from the dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
Coming Out Simulator creator to release game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where there are now protests that began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a picture of what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters - gangsters, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where an ordinary person can not go.
If he covers the events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored with the help of a hero’s Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platforms on which it will appear is unknown.
The case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how the photo is done and processed about it.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he was considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media cover the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from the biography of Case itself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about her relationship.
Heletey draws Ukraine in continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of defence of Ukraine Valery Heletey draws the people in the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian foreign Ministry said.
“Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Heletey, who announced the “complementation of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, the losses in which will be calculated in the “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research of specialists not in the military field.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of the civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if they continue the resistance, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that “the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” has been completed.

Today, the horror engulfed more than 60 stars in Hollywood.
Hackers broke down primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the blogger Perease Hilton’s website.
Really, not for long.

And now I will remove the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis,” wrote the blogger on Twitter.
However, all frank photos of the stars have already scattered on the Web.

Tony Stewart is in an accident back on track
Tony Stewart’s return to the track has ended a little more than in the middle of the race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall a second time after his right front tyre torn at 172 laps, ending his performance.
Stewart brought his battered car to the garage and then went out without talking to reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said 14 members of the team were upset, but would now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I would like to have a better attempt and a better finish for him,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in a Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of the right side of his car.
“I started today with a pretty big hope of getting to the finish line well,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt circuit race in north of New York.
He decided to come back this week and he needed to win either in Atlanta or in the next races in Richmond to take part in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the track to express dissatisfaction with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities said on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
The decision on whether Stuart will be charged has not been made.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud exclamations and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then on 122 lap after the restart Bush number.
The 18 car came off the trajectory at the exit of the turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but lagged behind to 21 positions.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with cigarettes with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to report on his Instagram.
However, one photo was very surprised and very confused fans of the couple.
The picture was taken at Zhvanetsky.
“At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky Maxim explains what is an instagram:)) #odessa,” Ksenia Sobchak signed a photo.
However, except cigarettes on the table is not present.
No coffee, buns, butter and more...
Fans of the couple decided that Ksenia also smokes, and condemned her for it.
"And the cigarettes of whose?, "Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast)", "It seems that at breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes)))"), "Ksenia, you also smoke?", - worried about her blog subscribers.
Recall that recently Sobchak boasted what a delicious dinner for the first time in her life prepared to her Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happiness is when you come to the cottage, and the husband has prepared dinner for your arrival (for the first time for a married life, but what tasty.The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he does not say with the words from the anecdote: "so that now this is every day," - boasted her husband Ksenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with diligentness, and pickles and baked chicken are already served on the table.
Prison officials of Bulgaria held a national protest
Hundreds of prison employees from all over Bulgaria held a national protest to the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return the previous working conditions that had recently been changed.
The increase in wages is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison employees has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations continue, the head of the Main Directorate for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Zhelyankov, told the BNR.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will join the protest of the prison officials’ union.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Praiut (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defense of Pravita Wongsuvan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-ocha, announced the composition of the new cabinet of the country, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Acha was officially approved as prime minister following the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to this post.
The 60-year-old soldier, who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the premiership.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prayutha Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which the protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister’s government Yingluck Shinawadrah.
Officially, Prautyuth Chan-ocha will be interim prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Shinawadrah.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army shifted brother Yinglyk Shinawatra Taksina as prime minister.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite entered the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 almost paralyzed the country.
No one said that the muselage will be better, I did not promise you this, the waitress from the new Palm braceriere will joke.
We have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has long known: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurateurs like to deeply declare that the success of the institution depends on three factors: it is a location, location and once again the location.
There are such places located not so well, and even great, but some unlucky ones.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the very TV show), then "Odessa-mother", as well as the restaurant "Beaujolais" and the beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgically-Soviet, but Belgian.
Over the ground there is only the tip of the iceberg: the bar counter and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draught beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottle (170-1550 rubles).
A cat-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "Mids are hearty big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite the individual shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpectedly executed.
Well, who, for example, is predicted that the meat roll with a Walloon prunes (280 rubles) - in fact, carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you warm a half a miller at once.
Salads are even worse.
Classical Lie (yet-lead (260) would be the most correct to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some clutchish iceberg, boiled once a long time ago with potatoes, sneaked into Kenyan beans, stiffened bakon chips plus for some reason pickled onion.
With such a Liezh salad you do not wish to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression also did not differ in positive.
If on the imminent quarters of the cherry tomatoes or overcooked mushrooms could still be closed eyes, then why did the mussels look as if during their lives they managed to thaw and rubble several times!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal White Sea mussels!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Sauces of half a dozen, the one that made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not work.
There are fruits, and there is no aroma, and whether there was wine, and remained a mystery.
But good-reliant to mussels of fretotes with home mayonnaise.
Chicken waterza here is not a soup, thick to such an extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant creamer soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was prepared by the local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the rosemary.
In fact, the situation was diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned out everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his lifetime was fed exclusively rosemary bushes, which is why meat acquired such an extraordinary aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful bait was attached to the leg of the rabbit - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce was superfluously watery, and waffles are dry.
But the manager approaching the table very informally asked for lunch experiences.
So we should come again.
The dollar rose on the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the upcoming Western new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculations "tomorrow" to 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - up to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, and paired with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, says senior analyst of Alpari Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will somehow affect the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to forecasts of the specialist, will close about these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to accelerate: from 5 to 10% will be added to current prices in the autumn.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be a vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
“The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria,” says Konstantin Bushuev, head of the Otkritie Broker’s analysis department.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, how NATO will sit.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went the news on Ukraine, moreover, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it completely shifts to the floating rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily oscillation, then it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
The alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, let me remind you when at the end of January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as the third of March, when the Central Bank shipred a record number of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the rise in the cost of imports, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative aspects include the rise in price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause an increase in the cost of borrowing funds, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX index during Thursday trading decreased by 1.67%, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative decrease in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions come to naught, and the quotations of the ruble partially or completely restore lost positions.
“We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar”, – said Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman said that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after an incorrect diagnosis.
Karin Rogers spent most of her adolescence, thinking that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Marie-Tut disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to the nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charitable organization CMT UK reported that an incorrect diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23000 people in the UK, presumably, have a SMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait, and pressed toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressed, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich’s atensidation (AF) – a condition for which was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, who is now 51, said: “I knew by the child that I couldn’t do what others.
I fell every day, and I had more time.
I never could skate on rollers or skateboarding with other children, and I had a lot of fun at school because I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical record when her doctor got out of the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
“I felt guilty because I put my nose up, where I didn’t follow, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and experienced the worst panic that was possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turn 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this period.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk was not worse as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think something you have that poses a much less life threat.
After several genetic examinations, she was found in ShMT.
“When he explained what SchMT is, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The charity organization of the UK CMT announced a month of information about the CMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the entrepreneurs of the Washington zone is growing as the economy recovers
A resetting economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia cumulatively paid $27.6 billion to the state treasury and locally in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on business and local levels last year increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after each other when the accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state rose faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenues, 56 percent, are on taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenues are accounted for by firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the least amount of tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the growth of tax revenues is due to a return to the previous level of property value of companies, researchers say, raising property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large share of these revenues are accounted for by large states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia cumulatively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by state and at the local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the company’s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Columbia companies pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is either the government or a nonprofit organization that doesn’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, chief executive of the state’s Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, on income taxes, to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also seem to be recovering, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a state-of-the-government corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, most of all in the region.
Although trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Virginia alone saw a rise in tax revenues below the average of 4.1%.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each has the same corporate rate) equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state entrepreneurs and locally and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as well as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington zone seems to be feeling better and thus pays more state taxes and locally, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs, paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure according to which most small firms are arranged - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with the recurrencies in state and local governments, up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship in judo brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final struggle with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion in 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masashi Ebinama.
Khan Magomedov, who lost his compatriot at the quarterfinal stage, victoriously walked through the comforting tournament and became the owner of a bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also reached the third step of the podium honor Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semifinals, she lost to the current world champion Meilinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship performed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze, Kuzyutina won against Ma Yinan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she admitted that the third place is not at all what she was counting on.
And again, the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze in the piggy bank of the Russian national team was put by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was the former representative of Moldova Viktor Skorovtsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, and will take a pause in the competitions.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he at this tournament got to the bronze medal.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who took UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed a performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won the category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he, due to the comment from the opponent, defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Issues, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his opponent in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent of the Question could not go to the tatami due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - her in the piggy bank of the national team was put by Renat Saidov, who performed in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was unlucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judokas won the team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a stubborn struggle with a score of 2-3 lost to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and volition - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team on the silver.
“The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,” Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home World Cup performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then in the asset of the Russian team there were only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We are all big maximalists, of course.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person enters the Olympic cycle is in the eight strongest, then he is the potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo, ”said the results of the tournament, the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merits, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers is unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are met by her condition, which remains “severe.”
The exponentially was broad, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can the kings
On sale the debut album of the band Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock, which brought rock duos from clubs straight to stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is only a year on stage, but already has an asset for a BBC music award, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of the New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before the release received 100 thousand. Pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current unfortunate situation in the music market, the situation out of the ordinary, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the “new R’n'B", but about a duet of bullish British, playing with the level of volume and intensity, which was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, bets on the first album due to all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
The duo not in vain took a name for itself, which before could encroach on only that very desperate hairy metalls, and the blood of which kings flows, as it seems to them, in their veins, is also clear.
We are talking, of course, first of all about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is, perhaps, early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs that met thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's talents, but a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to tap than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing the album "Better Strangers" with Shakespeare's quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock fans, but when playing in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it’s not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The strength of the Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather are already being labeled Motörhead’s successors), but brought numerous rock duos from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly the trick of using the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about instruments, but also in the very approach to the composition of songs.
Heroes of the retroroek of the zeros were very difficult to get beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance they went to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and brazenly that this pressure will successfully drape some secondary and hardness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online Store – and a video producer, and a hundred other things – buys a Twitch streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to the video service Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set the goal of being a general streaming service – a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time games,” according to Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which nursing give (mainly old) games processing, as in the "Mysterious Theater", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch has been met without much interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company that buys out a potential competitor.
This is a secret of why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shir: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watch it, it is difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a joystick in his hands.
It’s one thing to watch over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. when she sifts through Resident Evil, and quite another – to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watch their shooting without controlling the angle of view on your own, can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passages in which the Benniversaries of our electronic age complete the whole games in record time, entertain.
But if we are not talking about a game virtuoso or humor, it is unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will curl up in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch’s head of Shire, Amazon and Twitch, said, “both believe in the future of gaming,” and this channel does not give any signs of fading, even oh – as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the attack in 2004, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to the survivors - almost all students are now with the parents of the victims, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in a special operation by an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Already returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the department "V" of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic is that it was as if there weren’t been in Beslan for the past ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has something to do with it, people have difficulty agreeing to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But it is impossible to forget Beslan, and I hope we have coped with our task,” Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, according to Renhap.
The launch was made around 10:30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the lower house.
Its authors were State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more rapid and effective ensuring the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which parliamentarians are in a hurry, obliges to store personal data of Russians processed via the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of sites-offenders - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Money and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today by the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data repositories of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, “from Rostelecom, who has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provide their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that are already providing their servers today.”
“There are also several independent data centers that are ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will have technological opportunities for placement," Levin summed up.
The Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the Association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their record, systematization, etc. shall be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism for informing the user of where the recording is carried out, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory the specified actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.

Militia handed over to Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
In the “Army of Novorossiya” claim that the Ukrainian su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the agreement on the ceasefire
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militia handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were injured, as well as the bodies of 35 dead servicemen.
This was reported to “Interfax” by the representative of the press service of the “Army of Novorossiya”.
He added that "with air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereshka, a Su-27 plane was shot down, violating the ceasefire agreements."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side, when shelling of the Luhansk airport, used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia overnight managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"Losses in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered," the representative of the headquarters summed up.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured servicemen and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", "has stopped the attempt of the national guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the area of encirclement."
Then the militia reported the destruction in a fleeting battle of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarming of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) at that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen was surrounded by militias in the area of Ilovaisk in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian servicemen from the entourage.
The DPR agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy handed over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of servicemen began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense “Donbass” Semyon Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday from the “boiler” 14 people left the “boiler”.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “captured by 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigade of the Russian Federation”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in the event of the introduction of new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to retaliate aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,” the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is influencing the countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged “dialogue between the opposing sides,” the ministry said.
Also on the website of the department it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is growing.
Recall that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the introduced measures for the period of validity and severity.
New EU sanctions may affect the energy and financial sector.
Also, the Australian government announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Cunning Ways to Save on University Textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second year, came up with a tricky way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from undergraduates, offering them nominal compensation so that they postpone their sale.
“My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and Chick-fil-A cookies,” says Schroeder, 19, who has been studying at the College of Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature on the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and tutorials, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs significantly cheaper than buying them.
The company "Nibo Incorporateitid", which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented, says Vice President of “Fie” Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased at university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores".
Here is an introductory course in the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you will see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of “Mathematical Analysis” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 on the price list, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of Used
If you are not against other people's notes or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casadey, 25, fourth-year student at Brigham Young University says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the textbook “Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Business Business Business Business” tutorial.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Brasiy, director of College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Ethersta, invites students to clarify with their professors whether it is possible to use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small fraction of the value of the latter publication.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by "eBay Inc.", a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rental
It is worth considering when you do it well, you will not forget to get them back and do not want to keep them after the course ends.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you can issue for notes, underlines and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the value of the new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented, purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The release of "Mathematical Analysis" on the website Chegg.com for six months will cost about $ 61.
Braceyy says that students studying literature can often find the most favorable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, whereas literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Gault, 29 who is going to start his studies at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the book prices, as this ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you make an order online, says Golt, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
It wasn’t easy for him to teach him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the complete inefficiency of the Fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary to create TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, until July 1 has not approved a list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, lifting of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites to attract additional investments to the region, as well as to form priority development areas, which should become competitive in relation to key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
We will remind, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why the "Guardians of the Galaxy" could not save the box office
Sylvester Stallone’s “unstoppable 3” has returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the US, while “Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $ 14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappoint with revenue.
The article by the film critic of the Telegraph Robbie Collin indicates that when it comes to children’s films, it may be the bad quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the “worst” year in history in terms of children’s films, and called “How to tame the dragon 2” barely “functioning” the continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a somewhat older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film, released at least 2000 in the summer between the holiday of Memory Day in May and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of films of this year is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be a matter of changing audience habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the filming Disney film The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what we used to do.
Unlike the current drop in box office in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost doublegraded last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on the comic book franchises, and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth in his gloomy predictions.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 it is expected to release several potential cash hits, including “Avengers: Ages of Ultrone”, “Minions” and “Yuro Park”, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer of “Husbands X” Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office simply “cyclical”, saying the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the highest in the box office in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Food sanctions do not frighten owners of institutions with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, catering still prefers to replace prohibited imports of products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” the chief chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio over the quality of cheeses offer him suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozarella and burrat cheese ended in a restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan reserves should be enough for a couple of months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go yet.
The meat there lay on the carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's a cat!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed.
But the other day I was brought to try fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought us this.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer are in the outlandish.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must retaliate to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with the local beef.
Then I was asked, where did you get such a delicate meat?
I said it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brussery Bridge" hangs a stop list in the kitchen, which indicates missing products: French oysters, sea zhut.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Arrow" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will be bought by Swiss ones.
However, the Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I said, "Why, what is it worth so much on?"
They say, “Will we have to make money too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it turns out that this is a superdelicate.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "The first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the cheese reserves run out

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly called food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, clams, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups are prohibited from the country.
Restaurants began leapfrog with suppliers: prices for products increased, you urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have a very strong impact on expensive restaurants with the monocunning of France, Italy, Spain, to which products were supplied directly from the “mother” countries.
The catering has to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers have established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer-2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which are banning Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and seeding onions.
Italian Valero hopes that the sanctions may still soften.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the company "Vostok-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur, owner of the agency Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two to three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Braseserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to abandon 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu - recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, dishes are already beginning to replace dishes, for example, marble beef beef beef, says Sergey Mironov.
“Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the company “East-West”.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets went there that could distinguish the Italian mozzarlu from the Russian one.
Although it is difficult for the Ginza Project, he said.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menu.
A lot of time will be removed for the replacement,” Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Owners of the cafe of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European
But there are also many restaurants, which the sanctions will hardly affect.
These include institutions with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,” says Khatuna Kolbai, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe “Vai me!”.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, at the heart of many dishes - chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens. "
In the establishments of Colbai has not yet been removed from the menu of any dish.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chaikhon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not bothered: he will have to change only the lamb with New Zealand.
If Russia adjusts imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS you can find cheaper clipping, larynx, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows that they are tasty, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish that.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artykov, said that he plans to increase exports of fruits and vegetables to Russia by half by 2016.
About their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan declared.
Fast food restaurants that responded to the request of “Money” are also quite calmly responding to sanctions.
The press service of McDonald’s said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the department for work with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80% of the network buys products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctions products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
Did not affect the sanctions and the nozzle "Vokker".
KFC, Burger King and “Little Potatoes” did not respond to the request of “Money”, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy more Chilean than the Russian Far Eastern
On his humpback
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“For products for “Rakes” prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant “Cherry Mio” – twice”, – says restaurateur Roman Rozhnnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For instance, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pigs,” complains Sergey Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
The root of chicken has risen in price by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will find hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future in the "Stardogs" will be a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurateurs stocked up on food for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the price drops in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with a cheerful name "There is time."
“We have been going to make a holiday for a local food for a long time, and here are just sanctions, we were in a hurry, organized a festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade candies, the other day there was a master class on the preparation of borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tent is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Moscow region "Lenin State Farm", cheeses from the Russified Italian Jay Klaus.
“Slice for restaurants can be safely replaced by other fish of salmon breeds from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop “Your people”.
We catch a sockeye, kettle, kilozhach, humpback, Chavych - "royal salmon".
Yes, they are not as greasy as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands - he does not even move.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent lie shrimp with the tag "Magadan", cod, oglu, muksun, muksun from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to go to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand. tons.
The shop "Your people" has been working since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things".
Now Galkin received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he is hot.
We were bothering, trying different recipes.
Now we sell land through the online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkin's tent, I am preparing a portion of "Philadelphia" with ket.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to be chewed longer, but the consciousness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls from the halibut and sea perch.
In sushi bars, however, replace Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us,” concludes the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy a vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk about the replacement of imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily large producers of other countries, ”says Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
According to the results of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald’s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
In fact, no one really understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald’s is closed across the country, the script will be very different.
"Europrotokol" instead of the information of the traffic police
Payments on the Casco can be received without a traffic police certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocolo" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions according to which from September 1 of this year to receive payments on casco insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
We are, however, only about those cases when the accident was formalized on the “Europrotocolo” without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars participated in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached an agreement on the issue of who is the culprit of the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the “Europrotocolo” is 50 thousand. RUB, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand. RUB.
The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where accidents can be issued on the "Europrotococle", drivers who have been in an accident, call the traffic police.
After all, in the presence of a cassault policy, it was impossible to receive compensation for it without a traffic police certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft instructions are just designed to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for casco in connection with an accident issued without traffic police officers should not be lower than the limit on the “Europrotocol”.
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the cascaux insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both traffic police officers and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with her.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of an increase in fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules of payments on casco.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done in order to overcome the ancestral Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will wait hours for the inspector to get a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocle".
Savings certificate will be approved and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates for the bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable contribution.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings bearer certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make contributions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to the DIA, control 98% of the profile market.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the DIA explains, is that the clients of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his license, they are trying to get money in the DIA.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings bearer certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The reasonable absence of insurance payments for these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when the holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court, ”the DIA said.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay certificates to buyers anyway, since they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If the fact was that the instrument was not insured in the DIA, together with it, metal accounts would be prohibited, on which the funds of citizens are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one is encroached upon their existence yet.
The fact is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as quasi-devices.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before cashing out such a certificate can be changed by many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a personal security that must be stored in the depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable deposit is introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Nyport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests of those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Town Hall of Cardiff for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairklau followed us over the course of events over the weekend and spoke with the protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the terrorist group “Islamic state”, according to August 31 ITAR-TASS, citing a decision taken after the meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will send 30 man-portable Milan anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to them to Iraq, as well as 8 thousand. Scratch G3 and G36 rifles.
Supplies will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement on this topic in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the hot spots.
The opinions of residents of Germany about sending weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the “Islamic state”, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymenny (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported on the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 GMT.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from Blue Mountains
Two bushwhiker teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday in Gowlts Lip in Blackheite.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent, which included local police and rescue squad, and the couple was found around 11 p.m. near the Brydal Weil waterfall.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and killed his head.
Officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to the Blue Mountains hospital.
There are two unions
Negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of the Eurasian
Even if the alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delay), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this account disappeared on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them, other Eurasianists and Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko in the television news.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of a refined clothe, it was the behavior of a person who had just foiled the jackpot – and is planning a decent old age in a high society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) in Minsk at once, who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimation of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, is sure: from now on, Brussels will not be able to talk with Minsk the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be defrosting further,” he told Ogonka.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakthrough of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"The results were achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization, - lists the interlocutor of "Ogonyok" - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The United States has lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only pushed this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with strictness, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed a balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful the Lukashenko movement to political diversification will be will be, it will be seen from how often Minsk will soon be to host meetings in the EU + C.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton could not promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kocijancic only told Ogonyok that against the background of solving issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could also be the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The tar drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remained the central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OBSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” acquires the status of a handshake European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included European Commissioners on Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the CU countries on the Association Agreement with the EU looks like an achievement more ambitious than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, said: EU representatives “came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, and not vice versa.”
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all, mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, the long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Misez Research Center, former presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation, bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin squeezed Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk "Ogonyok" stressed, "- is not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply chains for goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is due to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establishing production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $ 4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very popular.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the Customs Union is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the implications for the Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Katherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk of its active role in the birth of the TS + EU format is denied, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev became the initiator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any bezing to discuss, not from the bay-janges to make a decision, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that at that time was in Ukraine,” he appealed to the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, it, according to rumors, initially was against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department is carefully stressing that Belarus, when organizing EU-CU interaction, does not pursue selfish goals, but the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, puts forward and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," the ministry told Ogonyok, the ministry, where they have recently meticulously pick up words.
In Moscow may appear areas with paid entry
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, M24.ru reports with reference to the deputy mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will see all the cons and pros.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this issue,” Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workloads to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that not necessarily all traffic is through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient detour infrastructure, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the deputy mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop there.
Recall that on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Sloka sinful
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s film “Sin City-2: The Woman to Whom to Kill” did not make the revolution that could be expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with minimal but symbolic, the participation of Quentin Tarantino, made a revolution in the relations between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if understood by the thesis of the universe of the noir, and under the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on, it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The “City of Sins-2” is chaotic in both the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the evil sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar from the first "City", although, here, Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only has time to snatch - in the role of a kind of people's handyman - from the air knives and other axes with nozzles.
But the old people are literally pushed with elbows by beginners, as if breaking into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, its story, shamelessly cut off by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Choseph Gordon-Lyvitt).
His own - the lust-friggidal Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, can not be distinguished in the face from Johnny - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are demolished with inexorable regularity - no problem and not even half-bed.
These are not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of the noir: a fatal bitch, too confident in himself, got into the "home trap" of sex detective, a corrupt senator ghoul.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with an archetype and archetype drives, it is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
In addition, even in this turmoid world there is something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense from the forces of darkness that besieging their native slums.
And the ghost of detective Hartigan is no, and it will look at the light, and it is always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem of "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter talentedly combined the comic and noir, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to transfer the comics to the screen.
The comedian and the Noir are two aggressively opposite “reality.”
The phenomenon of the comic in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time, when Dasil Hammet’s novels “Bloody Harvest” (1929), “The Maltese Falcon” (1930) and “Glass Key” (1931) created a canon of the noir, then called hard-childed school – “cool school”.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popais - a spinach's eater, giving him heroic strength, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "Avengers".
But in any movie based on the comics, there was something flawed: the painted characters stubbornly did not want to climb screen flesh, remained pretenders in the “real” world around them.
Simply put, they were frankly devoid of “existence”.
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What Foresights, which Thibo and Rugon-Maccarat, what even Bolkonsky and Rostov are generally conceived after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a romance peacefully mutated into the format of soap opera, and criminal - that is, by definition a marginal - the novel has risen to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet on his own skin learned what it is like to work as a nurse at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, is rude and cynical, and secondly - purely social.
This is almost an American version of socialist realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely by the fact that unnaturally, but organically connected the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not shy at all ashamed of his graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a “real” film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of the pen of Hammett.
And picturesque details, like the severed heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseous - representative of the neunair.
"Sin City-2" is not even a retreat, but the surrender of the radical style of Miller-Rodriguez before the tradition of the comic book.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel yourself enclosed in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls asleep a toy cloaca.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scraps, but by and large what difference does it make?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, in some places we have sometimes, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who walked on a crooked path or, say, to the inconsolable parents, that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place in a city of sin but sin, then there is no sin, but no one.
Boring, like any norm.
Chaos "Cities of Sins-2" is just bored.
For the sake of domestic rental, gave this fresh sin a small, but peppercha.
The credits warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the vegetarian episode of which a person is broken with his fingers, this gives hellish humor.
Hammet would have liked it.
The socialists of France should “close and put France in order,” says the key ally of Francois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “demonstrate a warm attitude” to the attacked socialist president, whose reshuffles did not take the approval of the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister claimed that his government would not question a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite conflict-footing proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “unified” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of Justice, inserted the sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pee, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she had no idea that the new Walm’s government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the previous one did not last summer.
"And the new will not last autumn or winter either," Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying that she was sure that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
The ruling party of France survived the defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party runs the risk of disintegrating a few rival factions until the end of Mr. Hollande’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Siangs Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to be felt quickly that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may be even worse.
“City without drugs” was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the managing directorate of the regional Ministry for State Property Management to the City without Drugs Foundation.
The department intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the lawsuit of the executive directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the Region (MUGISO) to the fund “City without drugs” (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, because of which it was decided to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
Representatives of the fund were also not contacted.
Recall, we are talking about a mansion, which was held by a fund in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a gratuitous basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the non-contracted contract of gratuitous use by the premises of the monument mansion.
According to the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not record significant conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17-th arbitration court of Perm, which was granted.
Then, the fund filed a cassation appeal against this decision, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Eugene Roizman told about it.
The rent was set 300 thousand. RUB. in a month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for gratuitous use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise,” he said.
Tatyana Drogayeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the Yekaterinburg City Duma, Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city Duma Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner of the deputy of the city Duma Oleg Kinev, who is considered an ally of the mayor.
How Eugene Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of “slander” (Article. 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the GU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova appealed with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her of his blog posts that she was involved in the crimes that her ex-husband allegedly committed.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
Ahead of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, new leaks appear in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
With reference to sources, American media reported that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of the new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this matter.
This feature allows you to make payment at the cash desk of the store using a smartphone.
Identification of the payment will be carried out by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time NFC technology (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader on the checkout.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC feature was introduced back in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that were included in the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, allowing users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay off using a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
The French foreign Ministry: the position of Paris regarding the supply to Russia “Mistral” does not change
The official representative of the French foreign Ministry Romain Nadal said about the invariable position of Paris regarding the supply of Russian helicopter carriers of the Mistral type.
“I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (François Hollande), made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France,” Nadal quotes “RIA Novosti”.
So the representative of the French foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market-value company, access to luxury cruise ships and Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals of the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests to comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Companies are looking for them to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company’s main shareholder after the $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casinos under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Thwarts Chinese Representative’s Speech Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday determined a procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nomination committee members, which is likely to be full of Beijing Loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot and forced the activists of the democratic movement to re-promise to stop the Hong Kong financial center with the protests of Occupy Central.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business center and staged a sit-in.
Lie’s reefs are organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the Council of State Feng Wei, were also scheduled to speak in a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government minister’s office in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israel intends to annex 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, owned by the Palestinian Authority.
The decision to annex South Bethliem is linked to the desire to repay for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in June.
The Israeli Defense Minister announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control in the west bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip Saib Arikat, the world community should hold Israel accountable for “continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.”
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the “statehood” of Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the detached region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin had not meant to hint that the Eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia under the control of the separatists, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reconsidered to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equally corresponded to the obvious strategy, which he should from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya a factual independence to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently named the occupied territories of Novorossiya, or New Russia, the name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns by the October 26 parliamentary elections and while government troops are attacking peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, an “captive of illusions,” ITAR-TASS reported.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to reassure fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s intervention to correct Putin’s words underscored the Russian leadership’s decision to behave toward a separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to withstand a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, transferring to the Kremlin the actual control of the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the main Russian navy, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7, that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh the amendments to the constitution, allowing the secession to the regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the Kremlin’s view of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and instigating Moscow are blamed.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed by new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastlines to Crimea itself.
This led to large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsk and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to the meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of tougher sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1000 military last week entered the Donetsk region to support the difficulties of the separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to the hackers, who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is indignant after a number of candid photos depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence, got into the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of “The Hunger Games” Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Greco, who lives in Melbourne, also allegedly, were allegedly stolen photos as a result of a leak from iCloud.
There are 101 celebrity names.
Edelsten, who made Greco an offer last month, told Confidential, “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos should remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
The Greek, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those to whom it was “feeling they have been invaded.”
It is assumed that the hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames, where she lies at the pool with a bare chest.
Palmer's film works include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film “Chak” Strachowski and the actress from “Forbidden reception” Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ, “It’s a brazen invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Subject photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is no different from the sale of stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
Discovered a potential way to steal photos of nude celebrities
Massive star accounts hacking may be made through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario described the resource The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in Python, which allowed you to select passwords to the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same bundle of the Apple ID login and password is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allows you to find out the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of combinations of symbols are consistently introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the service of Find My Phone the number of variants of passwords entered is unlimited.
If you properly organize the security system after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and inform the user about the hacking attempt.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any messages about an attempt to choose a password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a user, Hackapp’s Twitter user reported, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program for password selection was written to it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that it has no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the “stars” account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared extraneous records
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has previously been a wave of malicious actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations about how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers got access to the iCloud in the image described above, then a password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could be stored there.
The resource The Next Web failed to get Apple comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

Anger was the most universal and functional emotion of man
The angular expression of the face is biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists of Australia and the United States have found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The anthem of the face - shifted and lowered down the eyebrows, elongated in the thin line of the lips, bloated nostrils - are equally in all cultures, and even children blind from birth, who have never seen it, the lead author of the study, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen for effective dispute during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his conditions, and he conveys it to the interlocutor with anger.
Researchers have found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and move on to assault, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining”, scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry facial expression should present an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thereby formble as soon as possible to agree with its conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on the computer of the persons where each of the seven elements of the angry person was or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the omitted eyebrows or advanced chin individually did not make the face angry, the studied participants recognized physically depicted with such features as physically.
The anger of man, like in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing them to agree and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as the frog that inflates, or a baboon who demonstrates his fangs.
“The anger “launches” by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, demonstrating the consequences of this refusal as effectively as possible to the opposite side.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubie.
