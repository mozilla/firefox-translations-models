28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping center
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a flight of stairs from a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he can't imagine someone willing to hurt him, noting, "Things were finally going well for him."
"The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia," the San Francisco Forensic Bureau said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's San Francisco-based broadcaster KGO that Frank, a former pickup line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a close-knit family and will be greatly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galicia said Frank had stayed in hostels at first, but lately "Things have finally been going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone willing to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family was always to cook us a dish, to cook us dinner," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"For all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.

The size of Italy's public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
The country's central bank said that this amount is a historical maximum, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
Then the size of the national debt reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy's debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy's public debt amounted to 132.7% of the country's GDP.

Payments from the airport were received by 141 victims of the terrorist attack in Domodedovo.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviatsionny Foundation, which was created by the management of the Domodedovo airport to help the victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the press secretary of the airport Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
"The foundation continues charitable payments to the victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance in resolving existing issues," Vlasov added, recalling that a website of the foundation was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing complete information on the procedure for providing charitable assistance.
In 2011, in the arrival hall of foreign airlines Domodedovo, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed, another 172 were injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists came to the conclusion that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that an important role in the longevity of the shark is played by a low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the "neighbor" of the shark - the bowhead whale - lives the longest vertebrate.
The oldest individual known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years.
Putin has changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.

Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary for us not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get doctor's recommendations on how to live so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, you should not dismiss it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of visitors experience stress.
And the most susceptible to it are people from big cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with children, you will not have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide infants with the necessary conditions and provide services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winter, long summer, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, it is desirable to carry out spa treatment 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the caucasian Mineral Waters region, of course, is the healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
So, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces sugar levels.
"Essentuki new" has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
The same effects have water "Slavyanovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water because the salts retain fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums are available and various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of health improvement, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, silt mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorptive, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks along individually compiled routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine-bromine, selenium, sage-licorice baths, depending on what the doctor prescribes to you.
Let's extend the fruiting.
What can be done to ensure that the harvest goes on until the end of the season?
Says Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer resident.
It is time for tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepchildren, cut off the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biological preparations (Mozmer - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocid, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals in late summer, only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap should be used.
We do the last watering of plants.
Long-wattled cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the trellis so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, water with warm water and Zircon solution, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruiting of zucchini: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night cold, install arcs with covering material above the bed.
During the day, keep the plants open, and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia emerging from its longest recession in twenty years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP shows a positive trend - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth is ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
"The index assessment of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is left behind, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead," the Bank of Russia said in its bulletin "What trends say.
The regulator raised the modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in Russia's GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15, "RIA Novosti quoted a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development as saying.
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that "the bottom has been passed."
Among other markers indicating signs of revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If we make an adjustment for the fact that the year is a leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, over the past two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year in August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April in the Russian Federation there has been an increase in industrial production.
In June, the indicator rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation on the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labor market, the issue of real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the indicator is reduced by 4.8%.
This factor can hinder the economic recovery, since household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's tough policy can also be called a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is also an insufficiently high level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," says Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly rooted in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio former foreigners perform for Russia, then in most cases we are talking about natives of countries - former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the opposite process - a fairly large number of Russians perform under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Someone's parents took to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone believed that better conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
"AiF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa Red.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to engage in athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
Had she stayed in Russia, it is unlikely that she would have been able to "move From the throne" Yelena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be our only countrywoman, albeit a former one, in the sector for pole vaulting.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze medal of the 2010 European Championships and the silver of the Continental Championships in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Yelena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Largely because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to be fond of wrestling at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies at the US Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 World Championships.
After that, there was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was brought up by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was already a member of the US team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronized swimmers, but for America its indicators are a ceiling.
Kristina Shaldybina received a new name, which in Russian sounds strange, at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Up to this point, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, she, of course, did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - she led the stars and stripes team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" is Jana Berezko-Marglander, who plays for the German national team.
Yana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she was already representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the individual championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win a bronze medal at the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time athletic - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the national champion.
True, Ira still trains in Russia - she specially comes to her homeland in order not to lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a national record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4×100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time medalist of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing his citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports platforms.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Even less is known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, at home than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to engage in gymnastics.
He has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming lessons, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to immigrate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the high jump, Dmitry is engaged in the long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Mastery of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even becoming the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue a career in Italy.
There the family remained for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was caught with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original target was Norway, but it was not possible to get into this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
He soon won the World Junior Championships and later qualified for the Olympics.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again freestyle wrestling, and again a former Russian.
This time it will be about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently plays for the national team of this country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He won the bronze medal at the 2007 and 2008 National Championships.
Tired of not getting into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among youth.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "Cossacks should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far, it seems to me, this work is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is hasty and not known how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on the funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and utilities sector.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million rubles to power engineers.
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of including unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (supplies cold water) were laid 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at a price above the market price.
And there are a lot of such examples in the country.
People give the last money for the "communal services", and pay regularly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to investigators, as the head of the fund that was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but was paid.
Businessmen simply returned most of the money to him.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent them on his needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents is millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who embezzled money from citizens, swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles, continues.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Yelizovo, Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, the other two played the role of settlement and cash centers, that is, they accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to power engineers, but spent on himself, his beloved.
It is quite difficult to sue in the housing and utilities sector.
Cases are not initiated, they are delayed.
And the extremely confusing housing legislation "helps" in this, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of the NP "Housing and Public Utilities Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
The Prosecutor General's Office is also talking about refusals to initiate criminal cases, about red tape during investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes in progress in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
For the rest, the investigation has become protracted, and every fifth has been suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed by them to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of fakes - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinion of the owners.
And it also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population, cannot break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that tenants are in the red, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, - said Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues.
And now this work is actively underway.
These are not just single actions - this is a purposeful course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there are no scandals in the capital.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing and utilities sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the moscow government showed an iron will and restored order, - Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AiF.
I am referring to the personnel issue, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Management companies are closely monitored, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (both residents' appeals and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is maintained.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource-supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the weak-willed should change their place of work?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has given the U.S. an ultimatum, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a coup.
He said this, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to abandon their support for the "fethullahist terrorist organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey's relations with the West is growing more and more and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either FETO, which organizes coups, or democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice," the Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan as saying in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The Turkish president once again, but already more harshly, demanded that the United States comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an address to the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Also, Erdogan's supporters admitted that the Americans could be directly involved in the coup d'état.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement by representatives of the State Department on this subject was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he stubbornly insists on his own and also puts forward demands to his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date for the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara's introduction of changes to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe's own security.
It should be noted that on August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa relief with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of withdrawing from the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the defense sector - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others," the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the country's reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his own game and cannot go for a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both from the point of view of business and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework of relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post," the expert explained to AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of eu compensation, about the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexei Mukhin, admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There are no guarantees that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which with its help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
A different point of view is held by the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazova.
Now Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy pursued personally by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, there is active political interaction with Iran," Glazova explained to AiF.ru, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which Turkey followed before the start of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively in the position of "zero problems with neighbors".
Now there have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena," the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors' Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors appealed to the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel an employment contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chairman Helen McCourt said the government had remained "stubbornly silent" about the issues she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current circumstances, the JDC executive voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal renegotiation of all your matters. "
In response to the government's silence, the JDC chief today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to repeal the agreed terms of the employment contract that the BMA had recommended.
He told BMA members the deal was a good deal to be passed during meetings ahead of a vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a palace in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked strained, and he barely radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was fierce.
Mr Putin erupted in an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a stunning, all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from office last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They bet on the peak end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report said in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to that its lingering discontent with the snail's pace of talk of joining the EU and Mr. Putin's move — which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities in the wake of the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this gleaming palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
Key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it stands for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it's certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has backed away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, the brand's strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sport, from the Rugby Six Nations to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a customer and employee tour to Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed because we are now becoming more of a brand bank. "
As the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, as at the heart of (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank to customers and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring back those brands again, so I think it's the right time.
Francky Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket at Addiction
Dettori splashes champagne after a brace at Newmarket brings him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Francky Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - on Addiction, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idderi and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, as this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not a Royal Ascot — it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unpretentious.
Dettori receives applause when he cites Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached this mark in obstacle racing: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 victories in a record career.
- Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Francky is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no wonder that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical wit that sets him apart from others in the weigh room.
He is a great representative for horse racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have led 6,000 winners if he hadn't just been a weekend jockey and a big horse race!
But seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British horse racing, but what's more, he's an incredible jockey.
Franki Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with his trademark swift jump off his horse.
From fast finishes to brisk leaps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of Britain's smooth racing for two decades.
It's been ups and downs.
Scores of big horse racing winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was suspended due to doping.
Three years ago, he first ran into difficulties when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the naysayers and get back in shape.
And he may not be done for a while — Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not give a reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the president's protocol department and the government's office, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian language).
During his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are carried out.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and had recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that aired on state television, the two men said the chief of staff resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on camera, few people here were convinced – especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official announcement — that the man once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to manage Russia's environmental policy — was met with immense skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's state security service, just like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia's president after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be unconstitutional.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
The star of the series "Criminal Minds" Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with the producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and a difference of opinion.
I regret that this has happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be struck off the show, which is being watched by a team of FBI agents, is expected to arrive at a later date, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Durma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement Friday.
I had hoped to be present until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just wanted to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the very best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish Land in Banff Garden
A man from Banff sought help in identifying fish that had appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be gerbils left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a footage of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north span and the Queensferry Crossing Viaduct — meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "fans of the canvas", which are now coming to an end near all three pylons of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridge cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to the engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire pavement is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosaitha today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the widening roadbed of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern – or shore facing – side.
This was done by pulling up the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Elegant because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, it all went very well.
Rescue at Moelfr Bay: Three Men 'Lucky to Stay Alive'
The three men were 'lucky to stay alive' after being thrown from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13.20 British Summer Time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their vessel continued on its own.
"We saw their vessel circling next to them and anticipating the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind had swept him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing boat, and a third man in his 60s was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were hoisted aboard a shore rescue boat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency breaker, but it somehow unhooked itself from the man driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
That teens and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go pulls people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the TV, then video games and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring, of course, to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, all this lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once detected, can be 'photographed' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game as they were younger joined the craze by pulling away from the couches to search.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people it tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the raw data on the progression of the levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch," and "be active every day" have failed because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and another long list of benefits, too long to cite here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, the three foundations of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, there are boring nerds looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble upon a door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone applications such as Fitbit could previously track our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to practice, as this game gives.
The novelty will get bored, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the commotion.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on vault.
Relaxed on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute championship champion on Thursday, placing a chasm between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under intense Olympic attention.
Her overall score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles of the United States performs on a gymnastic balance beam during the final of the Women's Individual Absolute Championships in Rhythmic Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of absolute championship champion and the fifth in general, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and, possibly, ever.
She burst into tears when they showed her final overall score and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Championships medals — including 10 gold — with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the world as between it and a load of inflated expectations.
Anything less than heading back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unmet expectation.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Eli Reisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming the beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Marta Caroli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that's not entirely true.
Part of her floor exercise program — one that includes her signature pass — is set to Latin American music that would fit just like home on the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a novice walking child and discovered by coach Aimee Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single championship competition since the summer of 2013 — a streak of luck that should last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina gained a slight advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnastic beam and floor exercises — where Biles defends the title of world champion — lie in ambush.
She again took the lead with 15.433 on the balance beam and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score — pure formality — and tears appeared around Biles' shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the plan she had once recorded on a scrapbook came to fruition.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina in a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandma", was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise gripped by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from the start of this week now has an entirely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in the case of Phoenix's first serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 while their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the vehicle before fleeing in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check if he was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a four-month period.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of the house," Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
The liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and removed a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I wouldn't be able to do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for that.
Which, in fact, is not true - of course you subscribe to it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical institution.
"My first response was, 'I didn't think people were doing that yet,'" Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But it slowly goes through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language," Pixifto told CBS News.
But not just plain sign language — she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixifto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifelong prognosis because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixifto has reassuring advice for mothers of babies with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know things will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rain expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have overflowed their banks and threaten widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already flown to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high-water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said tanjipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flooding risk remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could flood the area.
In southern Alabama, flooding alert was in effect until Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the River Aimit near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a flood level record over the weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said the downstream flooding in Assenshen Parish is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly drain into Morpa Lake.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flooding in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest tributary she had seen in the 48 years she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have disabilities and are the only ones who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had been oversaturated with rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in Tanjipahoa parish and cancel classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that an adviser to Tanjipahoa revealed 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooded.
Parish Chairman Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the high water.
Shelters were opened in The City of Aimeit and the City of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In the hammond town of Tanjipahoa parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Emergency Services Chief Rupert Lacey reported that heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
Several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday, he said.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aimit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Towson said, "and it still pours on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets", survives a shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot at in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Brown is said to have suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He was badly hit, his little body was riddled with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot at: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station said.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapon cartridges, attributed to different examples of semi-automatic weapons, covered the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were shell casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shootout, "Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday as she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Lori
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The line-up of this team, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It has also strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed approvingly.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American woman to win gold in the women's individual championship.
And teammate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, fees for participation in competitions, payment for hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything out of their training, and it's an expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Honey, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to grueling work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of "Female Power" winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have taken up the task of announcing further strikes after jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with british medical association leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activities at night and on weekends to improve service after hours.
Dr Helen McCot, chair of the BMA's Young Doctors' Committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks to go before the first group of doctors is reappointed, progress is needed and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then the junior doctors are clear that they are willing to organize follow-up strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April resulted in the postponement of some 13,000 scheduled surgeries and 100,000 nurses' appointments, while nurses and consultants were brought in to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strikes.
Mortimer said: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and frustration to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate awareness policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics – such as staff distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those returning from a career hiatus, tuition fees, mutual curriculum recognition, sabbatical and gender pay differentials in medicine – were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions.  achieved by the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug for £ 2 a day can reduce the threat of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to use the drug for £2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE surveillance service of the National Health Service of Great Britain advised to give it to people for four years in order to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE surveillance service of the National Health Service of Great Britain advised to give it to people for four years in order to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to around 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is torn apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move through the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already been overtaken by one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
Draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, around a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences. "
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor beforehand, we are excited to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment longer than this period.
PC ownership culture allows rigging of vote counts to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting the government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye, resulting in widespread falsification of vote counts in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has lashed out at police, election observers and city governments for ignoring evidence of election irregularities due to "excessive sensitivity to race and religion".
A former community secretary, now an anti-corruption czar, said the religious intimidation of voters was so strong that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take id cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For now, voters only have to provide their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people's fingers when they hand over their ballots, with the goal of eliminating so that someone can vote twice.
Better protection must be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of a voting scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent Mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office over a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "conducted his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of personification, where a person voted by introducing themselves as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail-in voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
His report said: "Evidence has been presented of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote at the behest of their elders, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent.
"There were fears that ... state institutions have turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of 'political correctness' about ethnicity and religion."
Syr Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the "harvest of votes."
The report, before Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the voter roll from being used for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is being considered.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people's nationalities to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and postal voting envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set up cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People's Act Submission.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Amplify training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric violently attacks city police, saying it is "astounding" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the fruitless "checks for the sake of ticking" of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's ruling in the Tower hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and a state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for the cycling equivalent of Kate and other celebrity doppelgangers of the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prévost, who turned out to look impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic participant is far from the only athlete vying for gold this summer to boast her own famous doppelganger — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, Brady Allison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
Aside from Kate's doppelgänger on the bike lane, a lot of people online were quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused the hurricane on Twitter after images of him looking frighteningly similar to the Star wolf from Wall Street appeared.
And in fact, the archer found out about the social media frenzy and admitted that he had heard that he had looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarities between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to Horus star Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the "Inception" actor
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only equally tanned skin and blonde hair like actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Tough Women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, share the same face and eye shapes.
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason underlying the similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently reached out to the site to publicize her delight that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, U.S. soccer star and actress Dextera have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful broad smile that is similar to that of "Get Lucky" star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of fourth place finish at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged CBC viewers wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stench" and "died like a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was muted when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
McDonald, who was brought in to the CBC's team of commentators to "dilute it with color," could be heard saying, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who is 14 years old, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language used.
Emmett MacFarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig' ????"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron MacDonald, with many calling for his dismissal.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for making a comment about the swimming performance air."
It was a poor choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the remarks.
Commentator's friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
The CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network was also quick to apologize and release a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night, we acted swiftly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments referred to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the person.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the CBC broadcast of the Olympics.
"I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally."
"It goes without saying that no disrespect was implied, and I'm sorry."
Primark shopper insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped naked to try on her panties on a floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
To make matters worse, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place store in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place somewhere to do it — she just stood there shameless."
"Everyone was staring when she took off her panties again and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing here to like, got dressed again and walked out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, or what she thought of the person who would end up buying those panties she was trying on."
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "How disgusting it is to think that someone is going to take home panties that someone else has already worn and they have not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from sale after she left — and so much the better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find that another woman put them on and took them off and they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of the incident that happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August. "
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approaching you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If approaching from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
You then grip the gun tightly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
This is followed by a knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his arms, hit him in the face with the barrel and step back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, suitable from the front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery – unless you're a Krav Maga master – is to give away your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright takes his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, ran his tongue across a euro note, piccadilly Circus railings, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a movie called "The Lizzan Traveler's Guide to The Inner Power," yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking a train's flush button, which is used by thousands of others, can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health care workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Thankfully, nothing licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his gut, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he directed, he said: "Since I was a child, I have been completely carefree about my health and I was pulling a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab demonstrated a luminometer value exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: freshly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer value was over 4,000 units, while his freshly washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a film about the traveler called "The Lizzan Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizun Traveler's Guide to Inner Power" was filmed alongside Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, Niko Vuorenmaa, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let's put it this way: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite tough.
I'm glad we were able to capture some of these licks.'
In a 2015 valio survey, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria exclusively with good stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they consumed at least occasionally foods containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, a municipal house in Cornwall, on the eve of eviction
A family of hooligans left their council house at a loss of £50,000 after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing cooperatives found the property in a condition in need of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, debris was scattered across the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family has now been resettled and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a dissociator at Cornwall Housing, said she feared he wouldn't be saved.
She said: 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be weighed because this property is likely to be known as a not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple has three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and police say the kingdom of horror caused by the family included fights on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, old garbage was found
Floor planks in a home that sold drugs in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were given an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily leave.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors, who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, 'Nobody cared about them.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here – we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of cornwall Housing's neighborhood group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and the police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the council house.
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in who have bravely come forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their early 20s at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, matching supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possessing Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being rendered homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules of renting a space.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
"It's a message for those who feel they can behave without accusing the accuser, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched a beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun are terribly afraid for their lives.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was performing a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk.
Here's the moment when frightened hikers start to panic, while the moment a low-flying plane dives over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a warplane flying almost touch distance from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the plane's engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: "It flew very low twice and there was a moment at one point it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroz added: "I was surfing and I swear there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off shore, and was forced to sink so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires caused damage to the mainland of Portugal, and also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires, which worsened visibility.
The aircraft was performing a training flight and the pilot was instructed to spot the fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HACCP system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Inspections of business by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials issue fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food safety for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the CU.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials themselves admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, for a long time we were sure that the norm applies only to food production, and not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected deadline for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a rush demand, since their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking them to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting high-quality and affordable sea holidays is insoluble, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities have already been booked before the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian sea tourist products.
According to the North-West regional branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when charters will be resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary boards on the route, "says Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director for communications and international projects of the North-West regional branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not affect the balance of power in the market too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the Travel Agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, you should not count on the excitement - the bulk of the trips have already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but you should not expect a stir.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from personal income tax of compensation payments established by law within the limits of the approved norms related to compensation for harm caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuance of milk to employees engaged in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with established standards is provided for by Art. 222 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made to employees on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Proceeding from these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of para. 2 paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation is exempt from personal income tax income in the form of the cost of milk issued to employees on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and Conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow"Gazstroybank" was left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit organization Joint-Stock Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROYBANK pursued a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in conducting dubious transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank for a period of validity until the moment of appointment to the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSCB "GAZSTROYBANK" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On Insurance of Deposits of Individuals in Banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles. in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, as of August 1, 2016, GAZSTROYBANK JSCB occupied the 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Qadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Tasnim Akunji's lawyer said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of all this – as a headstone and a will to others, that these are exactly the risks that are involved when traveling to a war zone – to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Chief Justice if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's confirmation as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose someone who can replace the last Supreme Court justice, Antonina Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reed later said he hadn't spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is chief justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "henchmen" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats states that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as for men'
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Ballmer to launch a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with nude muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to go back to showing the eternal and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given memos about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to issue a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the department's specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
This will be general information and the legislative framework, the rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to properly draw up a claim and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them - Panov Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Zakhtey Andrey Romanovich.
"All of them give confessions," the report said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporozhye region, Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt during interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violation of antimonopoly legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play application store only on condition that other applications of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Art. 10 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will favorably affect our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations," said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulation Department of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The network "New Book" was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The chain of stores "New Knizhny" was fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide", according to the city news agency "Moscow".
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents."
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed materials arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor department.
A source in the "New Book" confirmed that it is a work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are being checked for the availability of the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to commemorate it in their native land," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
They noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of Neizvestny are invited to the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts Irina Antonova, the director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Neizvestny plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
The end user of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rush to litter the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Not All-AloneManageSogsLete, this statement follows from the factual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the record revival is due not to the boom among millennials who want to feel the novelty of a material object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
What's more, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It's also not just an act of amateur gathering — it has emotional significance: Older buyers of vinyl are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are youGov's results correct?
If this blog were a TELEVISION news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the center of a busy SoHo Street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating violently before stopping, folding my arms and saying something imposing like, "Okay, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent sellers – a few music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and trying to gauge their age and emotional mood through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and walking around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn't chase him home), run in lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles stems in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and stranded.
"A lot of what I'm buying is late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy for," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my flaw.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who had heard about the return and felt obligated to buy their old records.
Judging by the conversations I've had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to redeem their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable company to people with similar views.
According to Huez, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to retire to the constancy of familiar record envelopes, objects that evoke memories of serene adolescence.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or owning material things as a kind of reassurance," Ouez says.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do too.
It's an easy way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album in the past month hadn't listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I probably would have looked seriously puzzled as I flipped through the shelving of Bosanov's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More stuff, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who are just getting acquainted with this.
Fopp, which has now set aside almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less laid-back than in the aforementioned stores — Wild Beast's latest synth and sexy pop, rather than jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers — it's nice to see the variety in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is difficult to establish after standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes looking at the various records on the market.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is...", she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it – it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I'm looking at denim tight shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gathering around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is lined with plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any average collection.
No one is looking – perhaps because they are just decoration, some are located so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real "artistic vinyl".
But given that any drawing attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and sending a few clients to the outbacks of SoHo for a while, there's almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of its money on luxury goods such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in SoHo record stores, they don't rule out the existence of a huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday morning strolling through record shops on Berwick Street, flipping through records and avoiding the gazes of an obnoxious 30-year-old fake presenter who looms over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark – the longest-lived vertebrate animal – video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says that the record was set by a female aged from 272 to 512 years and a length of five meters.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Authorities in Calais said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
Calais Prefecture has said these sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the camp's growing population.
They have commented that makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to kick out the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the problems of the prefecture of Calais "were fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the spaces provided tranquil meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites that was in danger of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book children's café, which doesn't work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under the age of eight".
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers at The Jungle Camp had grown to more than 9,000 people — the highest ever — after a sharp increase in newcomers over the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young Svobodin residents to educational programs.
This week, branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of Physical Culture.
The programs are aimed at a children's audience, so for the most part they will be held in the form of a game.
Today, august 10, the library-branch No. 2, in the suburban microdistrict, invites you to a cruise presentation "My town is small".
On August 11, the local history hour "I live in this city, I know this city" will be held in the library-branch No. 1.
In the library-branch No. 2 on the same day a multimedia lesson "Native Past Destiny" will be held.
And in the library-branch No. 4 in Surazhevka there is a game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for children from the northern microdistrict, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Fizkult-hello!".
Britain settles for silver in rugby 7s after Fiji's masterclass allows them to take gold
Britain's impressive streak in Rugby 7 was crushingly halted at a final obstacle by Fiji's side in Thursday night's final when they were completely crushed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in possession, passing, evasion, game support, running lines and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came with a not-too-poor consolation in the form of silver – Britain's third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby 7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
A painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But, despite everything, Fiji in this form defeated the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for Britain – but probably not – that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former England chief from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost just one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is astounding.
Fiji started superbly, deflecting Great Britain's attempts to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Gerrir Tuwai added another touchdown down the right flank, which was converted.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb interception attempt deterred the mountain man Leon Nakarawa from scoring a third, but that only kept Fiji on track.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after resuming and the clock was still over a minute long... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more half-hearted attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The conversion led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby 7 while The UK was still mastering the craft.
Which pretty much is.
Great Britain made massive substitutions halfway through the game and they plugged the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for Great Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long been in the footsteps of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji's joyful approach.
Mata William embellished the Fijian cake, which didn't need embellishment, with another attempt in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell to the turf, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, with Britain slightly beating South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt each – the difference is British realization.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, tore up the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last interception attempt from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15th-sided team, Anthony, secured victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win rowing by a coach's battle with cancer.
There won't be more exhilarating gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 hard climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added meaning of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, coach Robin Williams' echo was always there while they were aiming for a second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that the two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold rowed a battalion of ready hands, contributing to the gradually increasing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your views a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the offseason, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get well quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said a few steps were enough.
Here's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
In the instant after the win, their first thoughts were of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, a captain in an artillery regiment serving in Afghanistan, said: "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked and Robin too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank you so much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the final 500 yards, as the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in phase.
Helen called, 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting that we could paddle well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a year for the couple to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at next month's wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited for import into Russia.
The corresponding resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import into Russia certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the Usa, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Disposal of food imported into the country in circumvention of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only in the first quarter of 2016, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for the "forbidden"
On Friday, rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
In the afternoon, the air will warm up to 25 degrees Celsius.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow in some places there will be a short-term rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 15 m / s are possible.
In the afternoon, rain is expected with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m / s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in the Oryol, Kursk and Voronezh regions, according to Dni.ru.
Next week, precipitation is unlikely.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia when joining the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation," the statement on the official website of the organization said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve south Korean judge Jang Song Hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Now it consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The head of the presidential administration has been replaced
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino, Sergei Ivanov's former deputy, as the head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers important the anti-corruption work that Ivanov began to carry out as the head of the presidential administration, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head who worked in the presidential administration for quite a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP, left.
He was replaced by deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino, a man who knows the specifics of this work very well.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance Bogusław Mazzec.
His words are reported by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," Mažec said.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters. m of gas, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG's purchases rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Antimonopoly Authority of Poland did not agree on the creation of a joint venture of Gazprom and its European partners in the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters. m of gas through Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will be held in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the company's board.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased gas purchases from the Russian Federation by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact of the Polish PGNIG filing an application with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall, the Commissioner of the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure Piotr Naimski said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two lines of the offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was announced by the First Deputy Head of the SMM in Ukraine Oleksandr Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane that landed at ufa airport appeared on the Web, which rolled out of the runway at 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The incident occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of KrasAvia Airlines arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no injuries.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigative Department on Transport of the ICR began to find out the reason for the hard landing of the liner aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A special UN commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack with the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, aviation dropped bombs with a toxic substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called planting.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense blamed the incident on the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed to the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe," the publication quoted an eyewitness as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of using poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour lull in the organization is considered "insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to bring aid to and evacuate the sick and wounded from the city.
"We have to send bulk cargo with a convoy of trucks in an area where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined," mr. Egeland said. "But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, Russia on August 11 announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities that will be in place daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with a demand to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions at the resorts of Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions thundered in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country's Interior Ministry was quick to declare that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing explosions.
According to preliminary data from local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks occurred in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, the country has already been visited by 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country's Interior Ministry "is confident that they are not connected with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions," Said Mr. Patanacharoen. -
But we do know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identities of those who were behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithichay Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside trees in busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the remaining victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Federal Agency for Tourism reported.
Local experts also attribute the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft of the new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall, on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country's army commander Prayut Chan-o-cha.
This step, he said, prompted the army by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok found itself in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, in January 2014 declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
As in Bangkok, two explosions thundered.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown persons on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and enlisted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sukhoi Log, the development of conditions began.
As it became known to "Kommersant", the government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not include at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told Kommersant.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them specifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project has been submitted to the government.
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project has not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the release of the government order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place as early as October," the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant, the draft retained two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to the ministries and federal executive bodies in July (Kommersant has).
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25% of state participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investments in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as Kommersant already wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to participate in the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal significance (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the draft "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but declined to comment on the details before the government order.
The requirement for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, kommersant was told in December 2015 by the Ministry of Natural Resources and confirmed later by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergey Yeroshchenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec."
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of "Kommersant" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of the times: do not give up control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor of "Kommersant", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, said on August 1 that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners."
Kommersant's interlocutors consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered to be a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov's son Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners created the SL Gold joint venture, where Polyus has 51% of the shares, the Rostec structure RT-GR has 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Polyus told Kommersant that they are "certainly interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, Kommersant's sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of Sukhoi Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Producers of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, in December 2015 estimated Kommersant's investment in Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are deterred not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious additional exploration of reserves and technologies for working with complex ores are needed, Kommersant's interlocutors in the industry explain.
The largest M&A transaction was launched in the pension market - KIT Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of "Gazfond Pension Savings" will be created NPF with a volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure for merging four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Nasledie and Gazfond Pension Savings - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of the funds KIT Finance Pension Administrator LLC.
"Reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of existing contracts," the company said.
The merger is carried out on the basis of "Gazfond Pension Savings".
As the general director of this NPF Oleg Bialoshitsky notes, the merger of funds allows us to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - KIT Finance Pension Administrator - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF Gazfond (35%).
However, the group launched the merger itself much later than its competitors.
Thus, NPF Future, controlled by the O1 group, absorbed Stalfond at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," said Nikolai Sidorov, general director of NPF Future.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been going on since April in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfond" should join NPF "SAFMAR" by the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by NPF "Trust".
"The merger of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses," the SAFMAR pension group noted.
The pause in the pooling of funds, which was withstood by KIT Finance Pension Administrator, can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds issued, in which the group was actively placed.
After amending the resolution of the Central Bank in March of this year, there are no more such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, one major player can buy out the entire issue," said Yuri Nogin, Director of acra's Financial Institutions Ratings Group.
Several heads of NPFs from the top 15 in terms of assets call another possible reason for the pause the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which had to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
On the request of "Kommersant" in the NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking, over a long distance this decision will be justified.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, "Gazfond Pension Savings" has fewer outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promagrofond in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is inexpedient to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, managing director for corporate ratings at Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of the merger," said Mr. Mitrofanov.
Sergey Okolesnov estimates the costs of combining the four funds at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles. per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget can really be halved," Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The kindest Disney movie "Pete and His Dragon" was released in Russia.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a touching dragon, a heart-wrenching story and country songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete names his buddy Elliot, after the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, overgrown and in a loincloth, can no longer be distinguished from another clever forest tomboy - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired female huntsman Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively fells the forest.
Now she will have not only to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also to help save it.
Pete takes a crash course in "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzlingly than in any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too awful for the viewer to truly begin to hate or fear them.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary at all, with a kind bulldog muzzle, an airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon amusingly rumbles, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but you want to stroke it all the time, this compares favorably with all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults begin to desperately sob in three streams.
Surprisingly good and young Oakes Figley in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford masterfully betrays a canonical grandfather, whom literally every child would be happy to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film Pete's Dragon, mediocre from nose to tail tip and remembered only for a mix of animation and feature films, and make it the most soulful film of the summer?
Nothing short of a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
The musical numbers and most of the strange jokes were left behind.
In this kind fairy tale, features borrowed from "Bambi", "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and many other sweet to the heart of children's paintings are read.
Disney studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the XXI century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as stunningly beautiful as The Jungle Book, and it doesn't have the skilled villain that Cate Blanchett turned out to be as the stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naïve film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the director Lowry will receive the keys to the magical Disney castle once again - for the feature film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
Worked out in "Pete and His Dragon" tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project about a non-growing boy based on the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found shortcomings in the case of their client.
We learned that the prosecutor's office made such a submission from the investigators just yesterday.
We planned to participate in the court hearing on the issue of limiting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting eventually did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office, "RBC quotes the words of lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze specifies.
As reported by "Kommersant", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation to the RBC journalist the wording about "shaking the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government illegally."
Kommersant correspondent ALEXANDER SILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local canteen and even passed the WADA test after that.
It seems that life here does not freeze for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village are carried out without stopping, since some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, already at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational everyday issues, - says igor Kazikov, head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team. - Despite the fact that the house in which our housed, consider it exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it there are now and then some shortcomings.
Sometimes there are problems with hot water, then, excuse me, with toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but only pop some substance on the floor, and that's it.
Their floors, you see, are somewhat innovative.
Like, you can't wash them in a human way.
Yes we know these floors - common laminate!
In general, they achieved a change of cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic Village is Such a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side by mountains, on the other by an impressive moat, sometimes flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence along the entire perimeter, along which machine gunners walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems, apparently, are the most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two ads at the front desk: a printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and a handwritten "I'll accept the gift of badges.
The stand itself is drowned in booklets.
Their cheerful colors contrast with the titles of the brochures: "Memo on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, entering the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, this: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, a favorable outcome does not await everyone.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the actual headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let there be fewer of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even greater uplifting of spirits, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev provides spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer service and other requirements by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the congestion of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which are recommended to be used during a fire.
And in the darkness she tripped over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, these were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, in readiness at any moment to rush to wash innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampoline athletes, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live in twos, the beds, of course, are almost side by side, but this is not critical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, is funny, made of fabric, does not inspire confidence, but things can be put.
"No, well, you are guessing, they have run out of tea!" - shrugs tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one, if only because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
Here they give out 60 thousand servings per day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "The Best of Brazil", "Cuisines of the World", "Asian Dishes" and "Pizza, Pasta".
The last option, as I peeked, is very popular among our volleyball players.
At the same time, for example, I did not find soups in any of the divisions of the giant restaurant.
What soups? Kuznetsova wonders. - No tea!
It's good that I took a Chinese one with me, a custard.
And a kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, our food on the courts is even worse.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a sign with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite, frankly, it was edible.
I don't even understand why there is such a queue all the time at the local McDonald's.
Well-fed, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoked, you might say!
To get a gift, you need to correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
Have questions on the Russian! - A girl from WADA attacked me.
But he attacked the wrong one.
That is, I was in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation escalated on the second question: "If I received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I settled on option B: "No, I have one hour."
I lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that there is no need to expect relief from WADA.
In general, you need to appear immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I found it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I'm having a hard time, by the way!), then I could use supplements to get "extra nutrients to boost my productivity."
Oh no, they don't allow it!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but insistently, in a few sentences it is dissuaded.
It's not fair to play this WADA!
How are you, Russia? The quiz host asks mockingly.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and our entire bleeding team.
So I focused and won the unfortunate shirt with all my might.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
I became interested in counting simulators.
I lost 250.
I was surprised to note that not a single Russian athlete was found in this heap of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let the one who does not know how to play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line to see an optometrist.
Don't worry, don't shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever there is spitting, there is an apparatus for issuing condoms.
Inscribed on it is an uplifting exhortation: "Celebrate with a condom!"
Then it remains only to twist the iron, resembling the handle of a door lock, and the condom, made of natural Latex of the Amazon, readily falls out of the device.
I took one as a keepsake.
Athletes will not lose - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for a festive and idle pastime in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near it, just in case, there is an informative sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $ 3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices that look like video simulators.
What's that? - I ask a friend in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
I could, of course, just say that I don't want to talk to a person in the uniform of the Russian national team, and that's it.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence, the eyes ripple from the guys in the zhovto-blakit.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking into every corner of it, you need at least three hours.
But, if you walk, and not drive electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bathroom, and a ticket office, and laundry, and dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique brands (only you still can not wait out the queue of Chinese philatelists),  and the bank, and the lost and found bureau, and the photo kiosk.
And late at night, exhausted, you will sit down near an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you will, to the accompaniment of a machine randomly spraying liquid to kill insects, think about the eternal.
That is, about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: I received the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the foil at the XXXI Olympic Games.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who has seen this happen – not counting those who, of course, watched the carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Imagine this: a dead Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs - as always by one o'clock in the morning - wake up and begin to angrily, but very loudly, shout at each other.
And moving furniture menacingly.
A faucet is leaking in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so I just kept the match, First and Russia channels under control - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the birthplace of replays, all the sport there for some reason is recorded.
There, the series are broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news first about the great semifinal of Deriglazov--Shanayev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is usa--Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, the first half generally won.
They put americans who were stunned by their own greatness in their place.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will not be the same.
That's all well and good, but a fight with Di Francigza is coming up, and there's no change on screen.
In a slight panic, I begin to leaf through the channels.
It feels like it's spinning for the second time in a row.
Okay, let's go deeper, to the cables.
There is no fencing at any of the thematic "Matches".
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of the "First", it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova counterattacks perfectly, goes forward on points - and quite obviously begins to drag out time.
The Italian wins back almost the entire lead.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca rushes to Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman gives an injection.
Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
It turns out that I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar in order to force young Tatars to "learn their native language."
The department says that this "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand the Tatar language.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the Tatarstan Duma unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language."
"For those who say that it is 'hard', in every big mosque we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques sermons "should already be in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the Duma of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough "can thoroughly prepare for them."
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the districts Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mainly the Russian language.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnayev mosque, Zakabannaya and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, the management sets the task that all students speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any infringement of The Netatar Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not mandatory, the main part of namaz."
At the same time, namaz itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian language will be preserved in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of displacing the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to his information, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (CGT).
The head of the executive committee of the CGT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: "Mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language is "the desire of the imams themselves," but the executive committee of the CGT "considers this correct."
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who conducted sermons at the Russian, are ready to comply with the decision of the DUM, but believe that parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They, of course, will be tough.
"We will have to rebuild," said Farhat Mavletdinov, imam of the Burnayev Mosque.
According to him, sermons in Russian language are closer even to many Tatars, since "Russian in schools, kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian language, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of our country do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we switched to Russian for four years," the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
It's just that the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service was put on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office approved the indictment in the criminal case investigated by the ICR GSU on the embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused damage to the Federal Penitentiary Service in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office sent to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the FSUE "Center for Information and Technical Support and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service" (FSUE TSITOS) Viktor Definitov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the GSU of the ICR in Moscow under Part 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of office, entailing serious consequences), Part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, on a particularly large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Art. 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the ICR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the Federal Penitentiary Service to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To embezzle budget money, the members of the group developed a scheme according to which the enterprise FSUE CYTOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, controlled by them, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FSUE CYTOS did not have production equipment, buildings, structures for the placement of production facilities that allow creating a complete production cycle of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were on the accounts of the Samara branch of FSUE, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. cashed funds were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case against which was allocated to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the fraud, was found to have cartridges of unknown origin for the award pistol, which made it possible to bring an additional charge against him.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penitentiary Service filed a lawsuit against the defendants for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukyur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for former football player and then member of parliament Hakan Shukur and searched two of his family's homes.
The star of Turkish football of the 1990s - early 2000s, striker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with the coup attempt that occurred last month.
The forward, who retired in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group."
We are talking about the movement "Hizmet" - a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is president Erdogan who considers the organizer of the attempted military coup that occurred on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, today an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Shukyur, the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, Fethullah Gulen's organization included his father.
However, neither the former footballer himself nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now reside in the United States.
When he was a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
However, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Şükür is still the most productive striker of the Turkish national team: he has 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy post because of the corruption investigation that began around Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, arrest warrants were issued in Turkey on July 25 for at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and links with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media workers could face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the audience with major Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped," the filmmaker said.
Recall, on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in the Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian areas from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of the former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulich was detained.
As another lawyer of the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant, Konstantin Akulich was summoned today to the investigative department of the ICR of Miass to be charged in the case of beatings a year ago.
Then Konstantin Akulich went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially, it was initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich," Sergei Kolosovsky said.
Konstantin Akulich became the lawyer of the former deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was summoned to the ICR of Miass, the defense was notified that on Monday the deadline for familiarization with the materials of the fraud case, in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused, expires.

The Russian Copper Company (RCC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RCC undertook to modernize one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabash copper smelting plant.
Karabash Copper Smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the vital activity of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company came under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the South Urals called the grandiose changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RCC group.
The main measure for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows capturing up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter redistribution.
Replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas duct is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new workshop for the treatment of industrial effluents worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes deducted to the budget of the city of Karabash will also grow.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
US officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the servers of the Democratic Party, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
Reportedly, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities of attacking servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that usually the United States prefers not to specify by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the hacking of the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures in 2014, the responsibility for which was officially assigned to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued an executive order making it easier to impose sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but can be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers were supported by Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama admits the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, whose hackers broke into the servers of the national committee of the Democratic Party.
The WikiLeaks website published emails from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
Fas found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and imposed on mobile device manufacturers the installation of other applications along with the Google Play store.
Following the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said the deputy head of the FAS Alexei Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the resolution.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition must be complied with by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further actions: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not give consent to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion of Ekho Moskvy was expressed by the leading analyst of mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it's racially insensitive.
With the Lenses tool, Snapchat allows an estimated 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to match a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curvy features of tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become common knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have come under fire in the past when they've been accused of the app touting dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of "yellow-faced" Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies pointed to the company's bigger problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, reports spread and then outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was intended as a reverence for anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said the lens was "offensive and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very crude caricature of Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly derogatory yellow-faced.
Snapchat isn't the only company going through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — could mean they're more likely to be educated.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, "it's much harder for this course of events to go unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial tensions are the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, male-only management and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who herself is a Chinese-American, wrote, "Either they didn't have enough non-white people on their staff to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working for them, but they don't hold positions in which to speak out safely and openly."
Other reviewers share her point, complaining that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and active attempts to engage internal resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account private, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it won't go that way."
Military leadership distorts intelligence on ISIS, congressional commission says
Officials at U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground suggest, a congressional panel said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report from a task force set up by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim leaders have corrected their assessments of U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by Centcom's high command tended to give a more optimistic portrayal of U.S. counterterrorism than confirmed by actual data from the field, and were consistently more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," the report said in a news release on the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable: When an unreliable analysis is presented to senior management, our military suffers," said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that constantly arose in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While he does not provide definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be falsified, he argues that analysts felt that Centcom's leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at recapturing Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, we know this for sure," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leadership of U.S. Central Command forged the command's intelligence documents to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a task force when they learned analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been tampered with.
As the investigation progresses, the report released Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, unfinished at the moment, investigation of centcom's intelligence data is being conducted by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the US Congress published on Thursday their own data, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed procedure for making intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., the Democratic party's top representative on the committee, said in a statement.
That procedure, Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence documents," damaged analysts' morale, and "does not sufficiently reflect divergent views."
But Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "predetermined or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics related to national security."
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is achieving its goal (as more and more Defense Ministry officials are now claiming).
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration, because of the protest of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on Islamic State-owned refineries had not led to a significant deterioration in the terrorist group's financial situation because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not disseminated outside of Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then commander of centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testifying in the Senate, which many lawmakers saw as an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins 4 consecutive women's field hockey, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam opened the scoring Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she's not sure if she would have ever done something similar.
"I don't think so," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who tracks their goals.
Here's what she knows: The Americans' score is 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they're competing for first place in their group against Britain, which remains invincible after losing 2-0 to Japan on Thursday.
The Teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the outcome of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will finish second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of the other group, a little later, when the games of the quarterfinals begin.
Saturday's game shows, however, that the Americans here have made a splash with their surprise streak, four years after they finished last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final lineup.
Then came 2012, when things weren't going well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Coeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach and things started to change.
"A cultural change, a psychological change, a change in physical fitness," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the performance we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a shot from an awkward hand at short range.
India came into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the net, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of her first three wins.
She's on the hook.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - the "zen" of jumping on a trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanging and inevitable, it is a frenzied combination of competition and aspiration.
As if the Olympic flame itself is the burning torch that is transmitted from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or overhear your neighbors taking turns talking in a coffee shop and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time, handsome with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in prime time promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is vying for gold in an Olympic trampoline competition.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partially in the shadows, are those sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Breaststroke will always be with us, a long reign.
But if I'm allowed to timidly speak out in defense of my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition in the past 16 years that many people I interviewed were unaware that they belonged to Olympic sports at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share men's awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share women's awards.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has the charm of an outsider, in part because, for the unenlightened ear, it is more likely to be associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential — it's a caricature of never-ending jumps — but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "springboard for diving".
Contenders for victory jump on a giant trampoline, soaring into the air for almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, folds and flips) before finally landing on their feet.
They are judged on their performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in full view of television cameras, to another teasing milestone: a world or Olympic record.
This stubborn desire is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But it is also, in my opinion, somewhat tiring when watching the Games.
From it, jumping on a trampoline gives a respite.
The direction of the trampoline is upwards.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, there is no competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no insane zeal for the finish, no long jump, only the wondrous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women's qualifying competitions, followed by the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcasting at one o'clock in the afternoon Eastern European Time; men's - on Saturday, also at one o'clock.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily overlooked in a common dump.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to the coveted gaze and objectification — as male gymnasts from the United States recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — Dooley is just waiting for his new admiring crowd of fans.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a firm ally of the West with a booming economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets, demanding radical political change.
According to human rights advocates, the government's response has been brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot dead dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from protest sites, allegedly filmed late last year or early this year, shows security officers beating young men with sticks as they are placed with their hands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it will continue to be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repression – opposition in the state was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no options but to protest, there will be an uprising," said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
Complaints range from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been simmering in the depths of the soul for several years, are flare up now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to socialize as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet service has gotten better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find a way to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized themselves for the protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amharas of Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But that's also changing.
"We will work together under a unified command," said Mulatou Gemechu, oromo's leader.
The largest protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's acting prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at recognizing the first signals of discontent and using scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government locked up and then falsified the results.
In the ensuing crackdown, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as a new intercity train and significant successes in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently announced it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
"And it's going to be hard to walk that tightrope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama by "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to hush up the latest conflict engulfing his campaign on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to address the American people in a meaningful way.
It also embarrassed his deputies, who were trying to protect him during the period of unrest, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After making that assumption at Wednesday night's convention, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet in the early hours of Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just snide.
The post was the exact opposite of a claim made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not jump at the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after he incured widespread criticism by practically floating the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, watching them act and then 'explaining' them one way or the other, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them in different ways.
Instead of softening the rhetoric to the broader electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days as his approval ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking released Friday showed trump trailing Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is on par with her in Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has come under increased scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have embarrassed his loyal allies: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump's best-known deputies, made a serious effort to defend the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened, because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans say that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to firmly resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to tweet at the media for smearing his every word and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" TV pundits who were trying to figure it out and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats derided Trump's excuses as further confirmation that he was not fit for president.
Once supplanted coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Coffee Shop was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a display case on Bedford Avenue.
The Hope Sheri store, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in the renewing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and the Verb has now become a soap shop."
But although New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new Verba is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He joined Verba in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in the same form.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Willow".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and toppings of capers or fried onions are available.
There are dishes made of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old loyal customers.
"Many former customers have also been squeezed out of Williamsburg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and frequently visited Willow.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still drove in.
After The Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that appealed to me at Verba," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee, she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He would come in before work and order invariably the same thing.
"At fifteen o'clock on the eighth, every day, like clockwork, I would come and make my bagel with butter and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but someday he will change something with bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that a soap shop had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Hope Sheri" offered to make a special soap for "Verba", using coffee from a coffee house, prepared coldly, as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also chose this coffee house.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for it in a storefront to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other benefits.
A local juice outlet plans to bottle and sell cold-made coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee house will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in the new location, Witt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he had returned home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive Depression Eating in the "Dense Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved trendy Fifth Avenue dishes like foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Siegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans on how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in the history of food.
Koua's latest book, "Stew in Chinese," focused on Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on Orchard Street."
Their new collaboration, "A Dense Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Market Crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple saw it as a fitting starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
"Rolls were in high demand," Siegelman said.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, and a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe winced.
"He must have been lying in his stomach like a rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a smorgasbord.
Groups of women were cooked for male farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Dense Meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally challenging was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as rolls and casseroles became staple foods; casserole is "a great way to dispose of scraps," Siegelman noted, "because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become a sparingly distributed luxury.
People have tried strange blends because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish from that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining room table has not been a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange."
Peanut butter does not fit baked onions at all.
This was typical of many home-grown recipes.
More than ever since, home economics professionals — including Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — ran the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", take up the challenge and transform burda like pureed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The "Dense Meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly piquant are the stories about the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat pies" stance.
Publicly extolling iowa's simple farming concoction from his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in the gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "consumed not only the most dull food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary tricks of the Depression era were forgotten once the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelman says, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood Siegelman's mother's eating habits — that she couldn't throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, "She poisoned people in all seriousness."
There was one unpleasant case with profitrols.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: a dessert of prunes that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune mousse," Siegelman said, adding that it was a common technique to give modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe twice asked for supplements.
In the voice of a confident budget planner, he told his wife: "A little chopped walnuts would not hurt here."
The arrest of the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovansky cemetery has been extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovansky cemetery, satisfying the corresponding request of the investigation.
In the case, 14 people are accused.
Recall that on May 14, a mass brawl of several hundred immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons took place at the Khovansky cemetery, as a result of which three people died.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have laid down specific parameters on how much it is necessary to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summing up the results of the first half of the year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," Interfax quoted Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Research Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age by six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet of Ministers does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan reached the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan reached the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle from a prone position at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - this is a new Olympic record in the qualification.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 byllas.
In total, the eight best athletes passed to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," the French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gulen as saying.
Also, the Turkish oppositionist said that "if at least some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen strongly denies involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court earlier arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen in absentia.
Recall that the attempted military coup occurred in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will be reimbursed for attorneys' fees during a hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is eligible to recover attorneys' fees it incurred in connection with a lawsuit over a hepatitis C drug patent with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including sworn lies and other unethical acts.
In an appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to recover costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed military claims to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed military forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants in the city withdrew, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied military council of Manbij told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speech royalties, and the former secretary of state claimed $3 million in income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released 10 years' tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It's common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn't require them to.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Tweeted Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic nominee's declarations.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his rejection raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video focusing on prominent Republicans who urged Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate without exception has done for decades: to make his tax returns public," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or nearly no taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a Business Columnist for the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants who believe they may still be doing so.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backed the proposal.
In a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is under IRS scrutiny and that Trump is "afraid" not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was sourced from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons claimed a dividend and a return on equity of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee for Conservation, took it upon themselves to promote it, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we invented the toolbox ... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," Honeyguide chief executive Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps consist of lighting a torch in front of an elephant that has violated the border and giving signals with a horn.
If it was not possible to scare him away, then the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cracker in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick remains outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a thud, spraying fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year have not yet returned to Turkey.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 career diplomats to continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the turkish foreign minister said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempted coup d'état.
The country's authorities officially announced that the coup d'état had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military officials of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the telephone code of Israel at the "request" of the Arabs – reported rt news channel
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent unleashed a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's phone code on the list, with employees citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to german media outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to dial Israel through its own call centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the reception of the hotel.
The response he received there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind this move caused even greater anger of the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israel code be removed," a hotel official said, according to Lanzman.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yaakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "terrible disgrace," the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel has simply "followed the lead" of the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"They would be ashamed," another post said, indicating that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, was located next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, der Spiegel newspaper reported.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the speed dial list," the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted a Kempinski hotel representative as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under São Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% – reports the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been a growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic non-fulfillment" of the instructions of the general director of the Almaz-Antey concern, "omissions in work" and "loss of confidence".
Gennady Bendersky was appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (OPK) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
NPO Almaz is the parent enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea- and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM).
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Poliment-Redoubt and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Poliment-Redoubt" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, not a single truly successful test has been done in several years of testing.
However, as far as I can tell, there is no unequivocal fault of Almaz in this," Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense system.
Development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should go to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is carried out as planned and everything will be completed on time," although in 2014 the department acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that failure to meet deadlines for projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies resign from their posts of their own free will, under an agreement agreement between the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension occurred publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the almaz leader may have been a shrewd figure and resisted the "orders" descended from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to put up with such behavior.
Through the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the instructions of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish thieving managers (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The president personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of defense industry managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal composition of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleansing" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu as Defense Minister.
It seems that the president has adopted the well-known saying "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the "victors" in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, in the "civilized world", perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening its military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner races the finish line, causing the British to seize cycling gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, resulting in the Uk team trio defending their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the strongest that his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly made history, rushing along the finish line to snatch victory from the favourite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at The World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist jamie Staff.
They did it just when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kian Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man that British coaches held, seeing the potential in the Scotsman that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny — champions with Hoy four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes rode in a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a guest expert for the BBC and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison. "
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to intentionally falling on the track after a bad start.
He later retracted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said: "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium. "
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many world-famous races that winning the Olympics again was simply amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome is waiting for another five successful days.
With kenny's form on display, it's not beyond the ability to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
That would allow us to see kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — brings his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
The next time Kenny competes is in a sprint that starts today and is played over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a bit lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was subsequent good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-kilometre team pursuit each.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set when winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In a matching women's event that resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngawi improved the world record by posting a time of 4:13.260.
Team Britain has come to the point where it relies on a mighty team of cyclists to take ownership of the mid-season of the Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After actually exceptional demonstrations of total supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations eased in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not the least being the departure of Shane Sutton as technical director in April over allegations of sexism and oppression, and the departures of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening at the velodrome, it seems that the now legendary glory of Great Britain in reaching the top at the right time may just happen again.
The future of the Portland Steel Plant is in jeopardy due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria – as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers – is in jeopardy as the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move is a consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There could also be additional indirect consequences, as the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its Point Henry steel plant, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland Iron and Steel Works is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake in the plant belongs to a short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called 'hedge contracts' that were supposed to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017," the electric utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings starting in fiscal 2018 is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its filings by $187 million in view of "impending termination."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the steel plant or ensure the supply of electricity to the metallurgical plant."
The U.S. company said it entered into a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November of this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Steel Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not just kardashian's reality TV star, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of the American vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and paraded at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, broke the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of "The Kardashian Family"?), a prepared reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (brawlers Rob and Caitlin, also joined by everyone's most beloved uncle of show business, producer of "Family Kardashian" Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the appearance of her sister on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's birthday television shows (Seacrest utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the 8 a.m. program), but Chris needed that fame to go to other girls one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we've undoubtedly entered a new era of Kardashian show.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the Magazine's September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
The thickness of which looks more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News about which of the stars will get on its cover is expected with such impatience that in the last two years photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebrities who work as models" than "models who are celebrities" have been featured on the cover.
Academy Award winner and the face of the Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after that honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine described as the "outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in good company.
These celebrities aren't relatives of famous people, reality TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner falls into all of those categories).
These are really talented women doing well in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career due to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past as a reality TV star, should always have remained precarious.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
That sentiment bubbled up again after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there is no point in dwelling on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
It defiles for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a foundation from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own applications, available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own photographs of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in reality shows on television.
Community legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are denied service at community legal centers as the sector prepares for the effect of further funding cuts on already stretched activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to combat unjust dispossession, and so on — have already been rejected in an attempt to get free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, already operating beyond their capabilities, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people a year are already being rejected.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are consistently underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unfairly laid off workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected Queensland residents will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of community legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaschuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters have been sued: allegedly, the headquarters did nothing after the report that its coo in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun when they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realised "it's not going to happen".
Director Earl Phillip "pulled out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the campaign headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal claims.
"Guns don't have to shoot to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee made a splash by telling listeners in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" — understood as gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to elect judges.
The Trump campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for threatening physical violence, insulting by action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ran a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the High Court for the District of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity, not only in our localities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
As for me, this was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our nationalities and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics have been hugely beneficial to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our localities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be in a quandary on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an £11bn infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, from T5 – chosen as the airport's best terminal five years in a row – to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for the UK and I am sure there will be an expansion of Heathrow too.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of Heathrow Council and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play cat and mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to circumvent ad-blocking software is a game of cat and mouse, according to one of the companies that makes such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking," and it's possible that Facebook will introduce its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of just how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year's study by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to a spokesperson.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficiently profitable item for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were causing concern, as they would also block some non-promotional content on the site.
"This is not going to be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we've instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
A woman was moved on a Swiss motorway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after the woman ran over several vehicles on the freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near The Walrus in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay down on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, Police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, police said, urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the impact?
That's what the prosecutor should determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be found responsible.
In each case — both involving a person walking in the dark on a freeway — a verdict was handed down that motorists could not expect a random encounter with a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on an A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the female police officer — who answered the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that having a person on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Walrus should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA's new climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Research Institute have developed a model to study Venus' past, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surface and atmosphere supersaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously assumed that the small rotation rate of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could probably have had a rarefied atmosphere similar to Earth's and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had more arid regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographic variability to create the conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts like an umbrella protecting the planet's surface from substantially the sun's heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than these days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Even though Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves as avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Colorado team executive vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as my role as head coach and vice president of colorado Avalanche hockey operations with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the League during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs the last two years.
The Avalanche announced a 39-39-4 rating for the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second preferential ticket to participate in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy has won four Stanley Cups — two each with the Montreal Canadiens and avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend strike
Workers' strikes over oil workers' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and all parties to the discussion are embarking on a new round of talks, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes," the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to look at the issues with fresh eyes.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working on shore in 2014.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to end oil and gas operations in countries with up to 10 as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for crude oil: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational velocities of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotation rates of stars included in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how rotation periods correlate with planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, said in a press release.
The Pleiades Cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have an inhibitory effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger pirouettes make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster usually belong to very light stars," Riball said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang up their "dance shoes," figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational velocities in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in the Crimea is conducted by two departments, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of the detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar Yevhen Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, an oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, a gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcers believe that it was not possible to detain all the accomplices of saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At a meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous football player who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartak", "Zhemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as Warsaw "Legia", which became the winner of the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the very near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the duty to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian team to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation from the post after the disastrous performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team on himself.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees for "cost recovery".
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, has dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (by less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other wealthy states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index", which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional valuation methods, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is an upper-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, who one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not even think to give up, the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Notably, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians realized that neighbors are not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and student exchange.
Moreover, the Government of Namibia has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that revenues from Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of the country's resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why the government's strong support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it gains, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustible.
Some – such as fishing – are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard about the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the most high-profile archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
From one grave alone, known as "Grave No. 43", 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world may soon move to a nondescript-looking bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Unacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Unazite is located away from the sea, near the village of Yunatse, Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a gold strip rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, the head of the excavations at Tella Unacite, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it is at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date back to about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow you to date metal with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
Where is the certainty of which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that Unazite's gold is older than Varna's gold."
This is a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The place of discovery also explains a lot.
Tell Unazite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Unazite is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metal processing developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In Russian historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to arise around the centers of metalworking.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Unazite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Unazite the prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Sumer," Boyadzhiev says, referring to the conventional wisdom that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia — modern-day Iraq.
There arose the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
Excavations of Tell Unazite have been conducted since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Little has been preserved of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, dense urban development, a "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Unazite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figurines of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 BC – possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: inside the houses were found the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New finds and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have been preceded by something - something like a tiny gold bead created in Tella Unazite.
Porsche artificially aged the model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
"Retro look" consists, for example, in a special body color Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch WHEELS RS Spyder, as well as some details of the body design, painted in "white and gold metallic".
In the interior, retro dashes are noticeably less: it differs, by and large, in the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electric adjustments and thresholds trimmed with black anodized steel with the logo of the division.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case and a richly finished album with photos of the production process as a gift.
Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro targa in terms of characteristics is quite the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbocharged engine of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is able to accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the hiding of ads on the pages of the social network, provoked the developers of solutions to block ads to retaliate.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote", but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblockable" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret over this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source among the developers of the social network told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race", trying to beat each other, the injured party were users who missed interesting records from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have recently been hotly debated.
In Murmansk, the rapist will stand trial · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk Region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is very serious - committing violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia a crossvan Fengguang 370 and a pickup Truck Rich New - the site Behind the wheel of www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity in China class of cars, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views of the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
Such a price tag is unlikely to shine for Russians, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370, following the results of June sales, managed to get to the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic body kit along the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
The crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden slats, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla's" on the center console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and cars with simpler "music" went on sale.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 provides only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "aspirated" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a sparing budget of the owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, well known to Russians, but with a slightly ennobled design by Chinese stylists.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a petrol 2.4 liter (137 hp) or a 2.5-liter turbodiesel (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected "front".
The new flagship sedan A9 will also be at the Dongfeng stand, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative office of the Chinese company in June.
There are more and more minwan-like crossvers in the Chinese market, one of the latest novelties is cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notices for transport tax will no longer be sent by mail - the site Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed over the years: in summer and autumn they receive receipts by mail for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many will not wait for them.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" on the official website of the department nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspectorate automatically considered such Russians to be online users and crossed them out of the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" immediately after compilation, while the letter will go on for several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection's website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the "personal account" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notices by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of defaulters with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Taxpayer's Personal Account" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any branch of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which improvements are aimed at achieving very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - a 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping up the "muscles" of the crazy "helik", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a jerk in 5.3 seconds.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given to him much better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze out 250 km / h.
From the outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR with a dimension of 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking concept coupe with a length of 6 m, which will be presented as part of the Competition of Elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four eco-friendly new products are expected to appear.
