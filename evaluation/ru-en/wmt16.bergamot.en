The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using a social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region has been changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System."
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application change.
So, the replenishment limit is set now not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in the summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in the transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of money.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 tariff, valid for the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with funds remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
So, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the expenditure of funds on the social card with accuracy to the pennies.
In addition, it is possible to return the enrolled, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of settlements with carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the fare is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips using a social card were made in the region, and almost 25 million trips in 2015.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card, more than 470 million rubles are provided.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a call to 911, the teacher admits to the murder of a girlfriend
During a 911 call, almost without trembling, the university's teacher, Shannon Lamb, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed employees to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that the house has a "deck" that is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly handwritten on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to get everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the memo said.
Nothing indications that Lamb, who led two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by that time managed to go 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot all respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
The police chief of the University of Delta Lynn Baford reported that the university staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, organ staff were still trying to fold into one picture the motives that prompted Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped make a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his studies.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures on both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beivers, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school year told him about how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university &apos; s enrance rules meant that the doctorate, which Lamb worked so hard on, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of a teacher.
University President William Laforge said he did not know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "apovously, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from the campus as he was heading back to the Arkansas Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with an 38-caliber hijacking pistol in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with a working engine was still on the access road.
It was not clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a clever, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hererston said she was 15, and Lamba was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls melted when he was there," says Heirston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brundonnay.
Lamb and Prentiss, by the time of the events, apparently, had been dating for a while.
On a call to 911, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gautier in a brick house, the reverse side of which goes out to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Pracentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said that he did not meet Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Pracentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schuffer, a bartender and part-time coordinator of entertainment programs at the dull lit bar The Julep Room in the suburbs of Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and joking at each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, led seminars for freshmen and specialized in the stories of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of student fraternity and student self-government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in a candle-lighting memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by the authors of the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus, in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that the call of Lamb had entered the 911 service after Schmidt's murder, as well as the fact that Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, while the retailer of toys and goods for children assures that it will provide full-time staff and temporary staff with the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase the number of personnel from October to December.
Although the holidays are still a few months closer, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was for Michael J. Fox is a grand event.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and then it overshadowed me - Princess Diana will sit next to me," he told in the trailer for the soon-outgoing documentary Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to me that I am literally at arm's length and in one fake yawn from a date with Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about Back to the Future - includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemequis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "it's undeniably the greatest time travel movie that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and some theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia's military support for Syria that "there is no military solution" for the nearly five-year conflict, and arms growth will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the differences in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities "have made the situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they demonstrated in addressing the nuclear program on Iran and the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some tried to label the provocateur.
Others brushed him off, screaming like a joke.
Some are demanding a scandal.
But no matter how try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the results of polls, they have not succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means to the real estate tycot in terms of chances to get nominated.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated for the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to his predominantly gaining popularity, Herman Kane, none of whom won one state in the process of nominating.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's "Supercommittee of Political Activity," and the conservative growth club, recognize Trump's unrelenting power and are starting to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some figures of surveys that suggest that real estate tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump unfolded 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his PhD in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
That was 52 percent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 people say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators will prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are well-live towards Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have appointed Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "disturbed" or "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "frustrated" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "disturbed" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump.
Next in the level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "distided" or "be upset" if Jeb Bush's favorite is a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of inclination to Republican voters across the country think the tycoon has a suitable temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he's not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this thought.
When they put on their hats of connoisseurs, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four of the top 10 bet on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full revelation: GOP voters had no right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the previous cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mitte Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some connoisseurs point out that such a dispersion is likely to play on Trump's advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates who support.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a one-on-one-on-one competition in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Casic and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses it?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman for as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Several than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey, conducted on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with outline neurosurgeon colleague Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to elect Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his speech opening the campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's posturing will avert key voters of Hispanic origin from the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts everyone's attention, it looks like Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
There are 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government.
They are also offended by Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the Republicans" activities in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "furiated."
The government will decide the fate of the indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports the RG.
She noted that the solution should be found by 8 October, by the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year in the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
The holodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same amount is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, so far there is no final decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The famine believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for it.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do you get annoyed and blushing for ever?
Answers the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eye ages are the screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forging the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The exit is simple:
do not three eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet wipe for the eyes;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids of the harmful substances accumulated in them for the day.
Cleansing procedures are not superfluous to supplement with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, daisies), liquefying the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out by circular movements of finger pads;
washed makeup, do not use alcohol-containing means.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even greater thickening of the secret of the sebaceous glands.

Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the meeting of the state Duma, reports "Russian news service."
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"Very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not stand," - said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrains, which contains this line:

Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to cope with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of this problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, while the bloodshed continues and until people feel safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," he said.
About 500,000 migrants arrived in the EU this year, including Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe are thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic state."
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become the leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain the influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call significantly larger numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the session of matters is expected to the Prime Minister with great attention.
The new leader of the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn will soon for the first time speak at a session of issues to the Prime Minister, for the first time measured by forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will deliver the first of the six issues in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of the Labour Party's Parliament.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" to a weekly demonstration.
He also said that he could miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after he appointed the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tready-junions congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several forward articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he was "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independent" of his conviction of the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements over economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party members supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences will also "squench a stack" in the Labour party after Mr. Corbyn's appointment to office in the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Tred-Junion conference that the Labour Party had made amendments to lift the very idea of restrictions in general.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labour and pension payments, stated that there was "full clarity" in the party that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron will face at the "courier box" in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he "engagement of collective resources" in order to gain ideas of questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A to Islington North, a member of Parliament, said that the Prime Minister's questions were being questioned, and that he would refrain from witty answers and exchanges of quilts instead, rather than divisibly, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on the issues of the prime minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of letting other colleagues take the floor if possible, saying that he was addressing House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Becoming a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to escape the political style of the "fair balagan," often associated with the procedure of the prime minister, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990. The questions to the prime minister were a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

Pound sterling grows as wages rise in the UK
The pound has risen against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 raised thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the highest since 2009, and was met as a postponement to an earlier date for forecasts for a possible increase in quotations.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro, amounting to 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6,229.21 by 1.49%.
On the general background, SABMiller shares were allocated, which grew by 20% thanks to the offer of purchase received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Stocks of Burberry grew by 0.9% on the background of encouraging news from a competing group of manufacturers of luxury goods Richemont.
Recent data on Richemont's sales exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have started to grow again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it managed to get 2.5 billion. Dollars by placing the shares that was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi Paper and Packaging Group's stocks were the leaders in the index's fall - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell."
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sports clothing company reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax profit for six months to 46.6 million. Oh, lubble.
JD Sports chief says higher salaries could hamper expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a campaign on the initiative of the bottom to fight the onslaught of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A wholesale food supplier at the initiative of the bottom launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming infusion of 700 million by Aldi. The dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through media and social media marketing and at the Adelaide Show events.
The campaign is joined by retailers and suppliers of IGA, such as ice cream maker Simmo's from Dansborough, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets for the matches of the South Australian Football League.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - the day when this wholesale supplier of food, alcoholic beverages and household goods will spend its annual investor's strategy day.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in UA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will debrouch 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening their first stores, taking the sales volume from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Losses of revenue and sales of food at a high level of fixed costs Metcash can cost the company about 13 million income before interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Leading stock manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, last week, remarked to attend a business luncheon in Melbourne that Metcash "maybe a high probability of disappearing within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The share of IGA in the market has declined since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and Metcash's revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 retailers IGA, fell 43 percent from 2012 due to operational detachment and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually for the sake of equalizing retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths for 1,000 positions and helping IGA retailers in the reconfiguration of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that the equalization of prices and re-equipment of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinacis deserves honor, not criticism for their behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has indirectly suffered in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and for his behavior deserves more honor than critics, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks," was involuntarily in the spotlight due to the shameful skirmish of Kiryos with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnatti, the judge on the tower had to tear Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison stated: "Wawrinka was supposed to put on the shoulder blades of Kiryos, and I have to put this guy on the shoulder blades."
Since Kokkinakis last saw a breaking racket after a cramp in his leg rescued Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Helea is loyally defending Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against the UK.
"I am acutely worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into conflict," Healy said.
He really broke the racket when his leg was brought to the US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hopes collapsed, and I know Tanasi well enough to make sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he possessed himself very well in fairly provocative situations on US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he is trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a nice family, and I just think he's been a little bit of dishonest.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, fits well into the team, he never had a problem with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensively trained, he is in great shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for the sake of an important match beginning on Friday, believing "fortunate consent" the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not the controversy around [Kiryos]," he said.
And I think that Nick has gained momentum very quickly, as people like Federer and Marrey, he grows up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it is necessary, I believe, to bring him out of the center of attention for a while so that he can reflect on them, and it is best for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detains those who are trying to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
At the border, there were riots - hundreds of migrants accumulated on the border territory, which was reacted sharply negatively by the Serbian authorities.
Having been stuck indefinitely on the section of the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, the people who fled from armed violence at home, smashed the tents and settled in this area.
Dissatisfaction has increased.
When a police helicopter was circling over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police of special purpose.
In protest, some refused food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it "unacceptable" to expel migrants back from Hungary as they come more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral of the problem.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to take overall responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (nearning next month or the end of the year), according to which EU member states will accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to assemble an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that swept the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to close the roads and speed up asylum lawsuits.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Vengie Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a fence of barbed wire on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were involved in urgent work at the completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and a crossing point of the EU border for immigrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a safer life, not refugees - victims of military action, who have the right to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries. inches. Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider the crossing or damage of a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for those accused of trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press, who are on the border, has been observing the presence of armed forces with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported the seizure by the authorized bodies of 45 people who tried to cross the border, on the border itself, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, driving a railway car wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryosk (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to penetrate inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway, leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the rejection of food and water until they were allowed in Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the rivalry in the primary election, the majority of Democratic voters say it's too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choices than supporting other candidates.
Since a CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has secured some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and the moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support among men fell significantly, and Sanders lags behind her by only 5 points.
The preference given by Clinton's Democratic voters to 50 has disappeared, and Sanders and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by double-digit numbers among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point in this group.
Nearly half of the primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question as why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's the time of the female president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called a disagreement on the issues and the chances of election.
Since the vice president is contemplating potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third believe he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party's candidates, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would have chosen Biden as the second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand up for his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden with a big lag in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in the candidate, Democratic voters choose other options beyond the chances of being elected.
Similarly, the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, showed a good result in some key characteristics among the primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton's strength in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a certain opinion of him on this matter.
The primary Democratic voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal email incompetitiveness and server continues with her Secretary of State, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this did not negatively affect their general opinion about her.
But this is a completely different story of the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions on this were divided back in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say the email controversy did not affect their general view of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinions about it have deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result in honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest person rather than not, but as Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll, Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates won half of the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support underfoot.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump, whose support percentage increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a survey conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson soared in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasic, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, together rank third with 6%.
The error limit for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent survey is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in polls - showing support for 19% among Republicans, Trump with 32% of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In response to Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a freshman of Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during the ceremony ritual in the fraternity in the Pokono mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was brought against five people.
"Members of the Brotherhood of the Baruch College of New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the ceremony ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," the police said.
Officials say that the student with blindfolded and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back pushed several times while he was trying to reach the goal, going down a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurts and then falls unconscious.
Members of the P. Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited for an hour before he was taken to the hospital.
They, however, took the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mingog, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide their personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity initiation rituals, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said Douglas Fairberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jurors of Monroe were in favor of the third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will receive a charge of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this officially or informally, it is too," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a raise in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the onset, and how long it will last.
Specifically, for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for as long as 86 months.
The Stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the US Central Bank so insists that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, and how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that the hustle and bustle around the rate hike is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the "cheap money era," said Julian Jessop, chief international economic expert at Capital Economics, in a comment to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates to a more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the past month or so, waiting for a rate hike can lead to volatility for a while.
When the rate hike, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It's not possible that stock revenues slow down 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Fed Reserve rate hike.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically more - about 14 percent - in the direction of rate increases, remains quite flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal state of 14.4 percent yield for the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, the chief specialist on the strategy for trading in Nuveen.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of rate hikes, and equity gains are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point for the entire existence of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the rate rate was increased since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few people believe that it's long, with only 1.5 percent remaining in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question of "this time differently," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with their view chained to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve a rate increase at this meeting, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all cycles of rate hikes to date have been in the supercycle of an increasing financial lever with GDP overlapping peaks that precede a recession very quickly after the recovery," the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record of 35 months, it lasts only 74 months and is not over.
Fixed revenue has also become volatile while the market expects rate hikes, and this scenario is somewhat similar to that implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that in bonds the effect is faster than for stocks, when the federal system changes the strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reducing rates in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, bond yields are immediately falling," Deutsche said.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that the rate hike will lead to the fact that the yield levels of long- and short-term bonds will come closer, making the curve more flat.
Bonds with high returns often behave better in this climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in profitability," said Katie Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are indications that the market has shaped the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the Federal system.
In general, companies leading their main business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive - financially.
"History shows that "quality" stocks show performance above the market performance within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a stable financial condition bypassed companies with unstable state on the results of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields, as well as low-volatility stocks, also showed better efficiency than low-quality stocks by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage), respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of the floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Depositors could also see the profits through higher returns, although experts diverge on how fast it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "reducing standards"
Proving that it is becoming less different from a commercial competitor.
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is simply ripped off with Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into a Classic FM," the leader of parliament said, prompting the TV and radio company to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seems that the public radio station is "stumping" and is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that came first to me, in which you are actually just copying what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC director rejected the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music in fact does not compare with anyone else.
"It's also really very important, I think Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC brainchild that was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
MP from Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent music show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of 22 million pounds.
You see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Palom Feith and Boy George as judges, have been made in the "typical style of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in her own home stable" the next time she will launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money from those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales has slowed as much as possible in August, and the fault of this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of seven percent in online sales.
Last month, there has been the slowest growth since it was being observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help to contain spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of alignment of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed a minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of alignment of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it comes to the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which is happening on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in the amount of five times the average rushed to computers to have time to use the lucrative offers, thereby bringing down a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online are more likely than in fashionable shops on the central streets.
Muslims buried those killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the bin Laden family is sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the collapse of the crane.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, present at the funeral flooded the roadway to pay homage to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad procession passed by the sacred place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed out for a funeral, while the King of the Saudis fined the construction company belonging to the Bin Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj will continue in Mecca as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the boom of the crane raised with a non-working crane.
In the Arabic version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, it is said that the Binladin Group is partial for the collapse.
The English version of the news agency did not report this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the yard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked in order to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of malneuma of modern security measures and improper coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work conducted by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been among the closeest of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs the largest construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden was a traitor's son, from whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in a pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
The officials decided to pay one million riyals (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly maimed.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
Result - opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouse stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent of the Daily Mail
They say the British lay hammers and paint brushes in the direction, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to perform work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or gall-painting walls, it seems that you are in the minority these days.
Because, according to the B&Q owner, the British are all more interested in hired masters to do simple work on the house.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of services for home improvement, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in products for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 B&Q warehouse stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten decisions about shopping in the store are made by representatives of the weaker sex.
Most of the staff are currently men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of lonely women who are more engaged in the development of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helih of the leading British companies whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers, achieving an equal number of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50 percent of managers - women, including the CEO and the CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Time to make a decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the most important decision to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would do it, now believe it will still be delayed and will keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we come to the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubided, a senior employee of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, an economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that we should prepare for change, but everything says about their confidence that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8 a.m.CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" Hundreds of refugees chanting at the checkpoint of Khorgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has blocked the border for the displaced.
Seekers are already beginning to probate other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But that's a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone will cope with this, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill in the documents necessary for this.
And if he does not, he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymaracis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meymaracis for a number of years was a member of the center-right governments, which led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he, becoming the interim leader of the New Democracy party, challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr. Meymaracasi, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meymaracis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, giving way to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, the "New Democracy" has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during that time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Tsipras' false promises.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what really happened.
Daily life became noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was for the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if the election wins, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs have been in place or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties gathered together to implement the program by which they reached agreement without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meymaracis: In fact, we voted for Greece's movement along the European path, because we have a good idea of what a disastrous consequences the country's exit from the EU would have.
Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker's package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if it had not been for a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to restore order in the first year in power, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments that cannot be fulfilled due to the fact that lead to a recession can again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a erroneous to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to take advantage of the EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers" income.
We explained to our European partners that we are not talking about fixed monthly income, and therefore it can not be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras had never said that.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras has told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement bypassing the sharp corners that were in it.
We have pushed the reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that suited the Greek government.
At that time I was the Speaker of the Parliament, I was able to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that constituted the then government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The last weeks in Greece is a massive flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will deal with after the election win.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, action should be done, because if the problem overtakes you, there are only extraordinary measures.
And now we are in this situation.
Even the provisional government that replaced Syriza did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is provided by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that occurred with them.
This issue has a profoundly humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European policymakers must take in this new situation.
The decision must be taken at the EU summit, the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meymaracis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meymaracis: Thank you.

The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University, left a note with apologies
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "satisfied" for the first murder and would like "everythrow back," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, reports that a geography and social science professor at Delta State University called 911 at around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police need to send people to his home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a "driving" in the house that "no one will touch," but probably upset.
The police asked the caller, but he didn't name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
Arriving at the crime scene, the police found there the body of Amy Pracentiss, 41 years old, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm sorry I'd like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the evening of Monday, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
University's rector, William Laforge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb was clearly something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was presuming a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
About Pracentiss referred to as "good man" Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter, who 19, and that she is "dissolaivorated."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, which the newspaper "San Herald" calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
On the evening of the same day, when the police overtook him on the highway "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran away into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term companion of life to Farra Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor was reportedly also suffering from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Show from Manchester United dropped out for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost the PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will not be able to enter the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless podkat Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Show broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later, and then operated on.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad podkat with two legs.
On his Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you to everyone for your messages, in words not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more than I was."
Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw in the defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the British will have an additional incentive to recover for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said: "This is a very serious injury."
When any player is out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It has never been the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult for him now, because he did not have the intention to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, you feel bad," - said Koku.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see a podka under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure it.
It's hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Larax?
Every parent very quickly assimilates one thing: if your child liked some book, it will take a little time before you know it almost bye.
If you're not David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company engaged in the organization of children's holidays on vacation, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias written by Dr. Seuz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to retell the content of the book, but in fact tells the plot of the eponymous film, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original narrative.
"In the city of Almnobill, surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Suze (real name Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't look suspicious enough, Cameron's lyrics are almost as a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax," posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the city of Almnobill, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams.
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how the greedy tree cutter and the "long-hit" Nakhkins" knock-ins destroys the environment, despite the protests of Lorax (the name is put in the name of the book) - a funny creature with a mustache that "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR-task was entrusted to the performer who never read the child's book about Laurels 20 times in a row.
Downing Street said the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
For Adam Lita, there was clearly a risk not to get into the England team, but this is still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the national team that England took away for this tour, repeating the defeat in the test series with a score of 3-0, which happened last time, it does not seem to me likely.
I wouldn't rule out a victory in my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but it has players among the fighters who virtuoso accept twisted balls, and collective thinking hard; they won't bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Lit dropped out of England's test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his head coach at Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricket players are evaluated by the judges on the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I said it before) players best choose themselves.
The pair half-shoten, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for "Yorkshire," there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bailiss, spoke well about his mood, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and this does not surprise me; he is primarily a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the test cricket bastard will leave an impression - a difficult question.
Lit played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his and someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trotta for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hayles is coming, and he's a batsman I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire club at the start of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us on the site of Trent Bridge, something was already there.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as to those who were before him, but this will depend on the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening bastsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, keeping four high-speed bowlers, is condensed, and I'm not against it.
I see no reason why a beating player can't hit the ball, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Worcestershire, but it became the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as the "third batsman" before coming out as the discoverer in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and with my brief communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little, and the selecters chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayaworthin, the Shri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a workshop move.
He is one of the best guys to play, which will bring to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games that use the white ball, and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the setup.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it's a game or coaching work, and like Mahela has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's teammates Durham Ben Stokes was left for one-day, Ruth was given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I don't have any problems about it.
Although not everyone will agree with this, the coaches and the people selecting players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
A camp of supporters of the UK's exit from the European Union may win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to preserve Britain in the EU every day is experiencing more and more difficulties, even without looking back to the election of the brilliant Jeremy-Iss it or whether Corbyn is a Labour leader or TUC's resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbynas and Naijela Faraji.
An Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of their own manufacturing - some participating countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of sowing despires and undermining the agreements of changes that they mostly do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it "Deve and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and the finance minister are riding at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
This is all about me.
My European buddy, who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the EU awning - "Don't leave us with France," Berlin says - suggests that the horned ministers and officials in some capitals get to the understanding of when they will still be left, we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her gets worse, how she got worse for Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, Francois Hollande, is ahead of re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also losing its power.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, and Spain on the left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of the skin to help "shoes-Brittles" whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to extradite SNP-style useless remarks during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to spur the UK's exit process, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix" and "Britain did not receive anything of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans on their trouble know what kind of predator Flit Street can be, and how skeptical media tycoons are towards the EU, unlike the time of the referendum launched by Tony Bon in 1975, which supported our entry into the 1973 ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a entrenched Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "direct EU bananas" of a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Millibband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of tax-flammable crooks, telephone hackers-outwiches and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion of them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a riot gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let it eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was Blair's greater supporter than Blair himself in the confrontation between Cameron's idea of the referendum, as Blair enrolled in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of that.
But the mile of Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me friendlyly back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me - it seems like the risk of repeating Neil Kinnock's strategy of "boy Murdochka" from the 80s - a mistake at the time and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy for interacting with the press - not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he was on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider range of "small England" supporters among the Tories may probably say yes.
It's the same thing that Hilary-"Benn, but not a bennit"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scouting to admit that Corbyn's appointment as unbearable John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s, when his old father fought on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not something, McDonnell said, and not what Jr. The K. He told peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to popular opinion.
To keep a Democrat and his "boyfriend" Corbyn - remember, he touched me even - the discipline of the messages remains important in the century of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to take for granted support for Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the major misconception of McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership - within the framework of the Bennitian economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by little distinction, is the central principle in dogmatic debates.
As for his misconceptions about Nato, Tom Watson, we are unshakable that J.K. will not agitate for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain, when it can all be meaningless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the British's weak military actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power cuts spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE released an important report - the "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument," on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two more researchers wondered whether these statements had "a firm or infidel basis."
Martin McKee, a professor in European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health care - the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects PHE's statement that "the best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criterial decision-making model in order to summarize their opinions on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the sustainability report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of board members was not provided, but among them there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also announced the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting have experience in managing tobacco.
The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco direction at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, "elegantly agrees" that there is a lack of "vent evidence of harmful effects on most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capwell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McCain and Capwell said PHE's claims that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or smoking to smoke," are premature.
It's Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ had previously been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died all his life from his addiction.
All the evidence implyes that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence is proving and what this evidence does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly outlining the obvious that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do some of the harm caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks for the nation.
Former Channel 4 CEO Says BBC Should Stop EastEnders Series
Former Channel 4 CEO Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop the release of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot for successful shows such as the soap opera "Albert Square."
Johnson noted that the license fees should be used only to create such programs that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts that are likely to look at only a small part of the audience, at peak airtime, when competitors have a show with high-ranking shows, and on channels like the BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson remarked that he had tried unsuccessfully to establish cooperation with the BBC during the six years while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get rid of the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programs that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should be left on the air only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show airs in the prime slot because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else can show him is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't know how it can be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would have humiliated the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "before employees" and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the BBC's most popular show echoed comments by Sky CEO Tony Ball, who in his lecture in memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered the BBC to sell TV series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more public-wide broadcasts "continue to go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the pagan sermons justifying the income from the license fees of 4 billion. "Well, of course, we're making all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is looking at."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
On the fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds - big money, I'm interested, they think so because they're not looking at and listening to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission in favor of "introduce, enlighten and entertain."
He noted that now only a small part of the BBC's materials are formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issues of the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade concerts" (only some of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control the brain's cells with sound waves
The video shows nematodes changing direction when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have brought out worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using the pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
The pulses are affected by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers control brain activity with light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics," the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "ionic TRP-4 channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound for the effects on modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the worms" organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired section of the brain by fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass freely through the tissues of the body, so you do not need to go inside the skull.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to an ultrasound signal for a while," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements Mocking British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Destroying the shin iron shackles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
The vited voice and drawing animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the exhibition of defense technology and security systems at the ExCeL center in Docklands.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"Is an important announcement coming from the DLR line from September 15 to September 18?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line, turning into a silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help interfere with the arms exhibition.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland."
The team, called the Special Patrol Group, helped spread them across London using a "acquire of advertising spaces," a 6-pound set of wrench wrench that is said to give "about a third of the ad space at the planet's bus stops."
Londoners are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art, if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming passengers on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP pro bono, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice actor, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition - with a pass on the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's get them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and clever corporate ads, but "filling it at home with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity."
"They've incredibly helped us draw attention to selling illegal torture equipment at the show," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that these torture equipment will not be sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition goes from within ExCeL, where participants sell fantastically effesti products.
In a press release, Saab revealed the order for the "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder," received from the US Army.
It includes "unparalleled cumulative warhead, which brings an unsurpassed corrosive action inside the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be enjoyable.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
It has been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strenuous smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I've learned can be decomposed by eight simple rules.
Moving to the dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He's motivating him to talk: to tell people where you're from, whether you've taken an academic vacation and where you've spent it, whether you're Corbyn and why you're "hon, I don't love it," nor hate Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast HAHAH extract, I'll be home."
Take a break.
And help others to rest, too - ask questions and show interest.
It supports the conversation and helps you find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had eyelashes, and they'd give out fire to fire.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often converted to drinking establishments, midnight cinemas and places of common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and correct underwear.
Don't even think about starting school at university while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a haven, but many hostels form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long-term friendships.
It could be hell for someone who is trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can restore the energy I spent with you."
Try to feel when the student is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send SMS.
Speaking of the knock: do this.
One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Bring friends with baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies - not such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering home treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel that they have to chat with you, and in the end, it is likely that your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Poorly blinded clumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the appropriation of someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft - to take a little milk for tea?
Fuck the milk owner.
He'll probably not be ashamed of you, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more adult than my neighbor, who poured into his milk a dishwashing liquid to take it off.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make a noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to reduce the sound of the drum and bass, as it was 3 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally remained silent at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, and then cut her music in and locked her door behind him, going on a three-hour exam.
Was it not romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extremely, until the bite of the elbows, clumsily, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, carried away to them, broke the relationship and should have seen him every day, and perhaps watching him dragging all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you will not order the heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own ardor a little.
At the thrilling moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the joke and the bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but turns into the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never sucking someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not stick other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, select General, and then Software Update.
If you're ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some encountered problems after installation, when an error message appears telling them that "Applying failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the recovery subsides or try to upgrade via iTunes.
Tips on your phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include deleting apps to increase free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the update size, and also simplified the execution with a special utility that offers to uninstall the apps and reinstall them after the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that when the update is performed, your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone in the process can lead to a failure of the update.
iOS 9 is coming out according to plan, despite the delay WatchOS Review iOS 9: the least impressive and best update of iOS 9: how to prepare for the new operating system for the iPhone
You should make sure that you've looked at our checklist of the actions you need to take before downloading to try and make something stop going wrong, and protect yourself from it if it's something wrong. The iOS 9 now includes new features, including an improved personal assistant, and innovations that increase the performance of the iPad, as well as settings that increase the speed and fix the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad, leads only to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that further Russian support for President Assad poses a risk of exacerbation and extension of the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal of fighting extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power," the State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the "Islamic state" within the coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in attempts to counter the Islamic State."
White House officials said on Friday that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime as a "lose bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation has deteriorated," he said.
The imported yachts will be exempted from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to "Izvestia" by the assistant to the Minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the FCS, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service, and Rostorizm, to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about 200 million euros annually go to the treasury of European countries for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Customs Duties and Taxes," providing for the provision of a full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this, of course, will contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted to the subcommission on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release during importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkin explained.
The list of imported goods that are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them are service equipment (personal computers, machine-written machines), instrumentation, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" said that they have prepared mandatory resolutions on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the call and exit of small, sports sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport gave instructions to the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sports sailing and pleasure craft to the seaport and the release of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders from the government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the waters of the seaports of the Crimea.
In relation to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are under negotiation, - said the press service of the Ministry.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and survey, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is not interesting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go out on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht has no place to refuel.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there is a problem where to get it, - says the sales director of the company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the places for the storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. The yachts are also shipped to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a loan of $500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new financing will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," - stated in the message.
World Bank's Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimio Fan, said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan in 100 million euros to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies will be discussed.
About this "Izvestia" said a member of the council Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not been determined with the floor, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the departure of citizens to such isolated places only after the convicts will pass the appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Mrib is sure that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving the sentence.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in the pre-trial detention center (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, this is the only way out to work with such criminals.
Definitely they need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in conventional cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSIN employees.
The niplification of trances from the cellmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with an indefinite sex, you need to and count where to distribute them.
SIZOs are not exactly necessary - only the cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As explained by the Mushroom, the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then prisoners of transsexuals will be able to receive punishment from any region.
Citizens are detained in the pre-trial detention center at the scene of the crime, so the receipts of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says the Grib.
Recall that on the eve of law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to determine the detained for possession of drugs 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which the man with a maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on a no-departure subscription.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the mechanism of the content of transgender people in the pre-trial detention center and colonies in Russia is really not yet available.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places to serve the sentence by transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done for this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prison than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate trans-exuals in order to get to a different colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything happens unequivocally.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change the sex, - said Alekseev.
People can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve their sentences for transgender people, I doubt that the prison staff will be thinking seriously about the safety of such people and delusion into the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transsexual criminals in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of the sentencing by convicted persons.
A commission is being created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry opportunities allow this.
Therefore, before the brand of sex, potential patients are always undergoing such examinations - they accurately show whether sex change with surgery is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicts, because on average, such an examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general, the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, we can say that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, a small number," said Lordkipanidze.
Now, at the request of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world chess championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors under 20 years has ended.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Dudu, who seemed confident to go to the title.
The girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, by the middle of the tournament distance, it seemed that it had lost almost the entire intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (the competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently captured the leadership.
Given that Duda was the rating-favorite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the gap, it seemed very insignificant.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the lag to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dude your game.
Plus, this mandatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to optional mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party to complete Dud, who met Benjamin Bock.
Luckily for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a draw with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, it was the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, handed the main prize.
But in the competition of girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with the Buk.
The Russian athlete remained the second with a lag behind the champion at 0.5 points.
Vympelcom changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - to the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As noted by the general director of VimpelCom Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are carried out to "be left a strong player in the market," to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions."

The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food assistance will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and supporting an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product cards with the echo of the past times of total shortage, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," - quotes TASS words of Mr. Yevtukhov.
Previously, "Kommersant" wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was submitted to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the study sums up the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of the rating last year.
The winners of the last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the rating of the current year and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the original list is proposed to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of the functional areas of the company: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, HR Director, CIO, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nomination of candidates on the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the rest of the participants and can make their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology for the construction of the rating is the principle of "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of expert commissions.
To the full-time meetings of expert commissions, all willing candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for approval of the list of senior heads and eight commissions for approval of heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the places are stored strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed information until the rating is published) or make actualizing their adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant."
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for the investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market of lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you estimate the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in a higher rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, now it is impossible to do: the rates are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate level of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive profitability on them.
How much, according to your estimates, is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans?
After the depreciation of the Central Bank, the situation has improved a little.
Credit resources are more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, there is one way out for business: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of cash.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow to modernize the equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make the products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the reduction of the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes an increased interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a decrease in the rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishing funds and in options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to lenders.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese simply by virtue of its "Japaneseness" can bring attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can make any arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person will even agree with these arguments, even in principle, with these arguments, but the whole conversation will disperse from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only the technique, but everything else Japanese.
Quoted from the go of Bass, to season the food of wasabi, to collect katana and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more change the appearance of the car a new drawing of the headlights and rear lights, according to which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks terrified.
Silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance has a rush of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience a stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2L diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 liters. c. - only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to drive the CX-5 you did not be on the spot of your own accident.
In order to further increase comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, and optimized the shape of the bushings of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The swimsuit in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if a girl flaunts in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing action movie.
Attention will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides an optimal supply of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even long-legged will certainly appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the turns.
The widest set of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is both adaptive lighting and a warning of the departure from the strip, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, having a minimum of projections, it contains a cargo of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurums."
Especially jeopardous looks quiruma-pyjamas.
You can do it all!
To sleep, of course.
But more - to entertain young children.
Or just walk with such an animal on the street...
After all, it's so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev ripped off nuclear weapons.
Kiev has officially formalized the refusal of Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday, on the second attempt, still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law ending the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The bill was carried out by the government only from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the project.
The Khmelnitsky NPP laid down under the USSR under the original project was to consist of four power units of 1 GW with VVER reactors, but managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocs will have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved remained purchases of fuel for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation (provided about half of the generation of electricity in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NNEGC "Energoatom" has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans for the completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally abandoned: in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
"There is no military solution," - quotes the AP his answer to the question about the military support of Syria from Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolay Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to combat the terrorist group "Islamic state," banned in the Russian Federation.

The OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentaries to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," - quotes TASS words Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "to return to the normal functioning of our countries."
On the question of whether, in his opinion, it is possible at the moment a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of the contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev they support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were made by representatives of the Communist Party, who accused the election commission of "covering falsifications."
Opposition comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election commission refused the party "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of payment for overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city electorate officially presented the results of the elections to the pride of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand people were issued ballot papers for voting in the precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voted in the elections. The voters.
More than 11.7 thousand were declared invalid. ballots and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six deputy seats in the pride rely on Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the Communist Party were distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma Deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Fair Russia" go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusing the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the Electoral Commission Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he is putting on duty to "mail telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" for the rejection of mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, CPRF representatives said multiple violations.
A member of the Electoral Commission with the right of deliberative vote from the Communist Party Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district was closed the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located.
Neither the deputies of the Gosudma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, and the high-profile scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration could not pass for a long time.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of commissions with the right to consultative vote had the opportunity to attend.
The head stopped access to them only when the vote ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballot papers.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings, interested persons could be present," - said the member of the city of the election commission Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that in the blockaded administration building for more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the district council Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also indignant that in a number of PECs on election day began to seal the urns at 6-7 in the morning, laying out ballots for early voting.
At the same time, no one not notified the members of the commissions with the right of deliberative vote and observers, so they have already arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are sure that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations in the urns could uncontrollably throw ballots.
However, the Electoral Commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the injections of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission and the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through the bleak to go out with amendments to the regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, please contact the CEC," - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman with high-profile accusations was attacked by CPRF member Sergei Samokhin, who shouted that the election party ignores dozens of complaints and covers the falsifications in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, ask you more carefully!" Offended by the chairman of the election commission.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the election commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which within three weeks the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" in the registration of the initiative group for holding a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring two questions for discussion to the Nizhny Novgorod residents: whether they agree with the fact that the fees for overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled," and the tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020."
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the legislation.
FedEx revenue is mixed, the decline in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the forecast of annual profit due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its land transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers on the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers on the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 percent at preliminary trading 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to a FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite the increase in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will come into force on January 4, and an increase in fees for ground transportation of heavy or dimensional cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to grow revenue from last year thanks to lower spending, higher gross revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "worked stably, taking into account the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade."
Workforce plans on holidays were announced the day after a competitor's announcement, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share conducted by Zacks Investment Research by a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5 percent, to 12.3 billion. The dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion. The dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the urgent international transport sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit received a higher income due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector, income fell due to higher labor costs.
At preliminary trading about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years of meeting, the heads of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at the 27-foot table of Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room two-floors high over them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all the others.
The Central Bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have recognized that there is a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third assignment could prove to be an unknown factor in the nearly predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the nearly zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show strong economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets can deter already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve will do, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the federal system to hold back, with the key indicator showing only about 30 percent of the probability of a quick rise.
This can lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow of the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by expectations that the individuals that determine the strategy of the Federal system will leave a bet this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does that, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts objected that a rate hike could reassure financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seems to have leaned in levies to a rate of 0.25 percent this month, making the first small step in slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that it expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that greater economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, labor market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at a level that the federal system is considered full-time.
Rising wages show signs of acceleration.
And, although inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual average of 2%, the leadership of the Federal system said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and it needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average index for industrial stock fell as much as 16% relative to a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hamper global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% lower than the high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, market indignation further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate increase.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have started to tighten the nuts at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Federal Reserve officer.
Now, he predicts, they will be waiting for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data since China's recent events," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal system, and it should not be taken into account in making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve has become global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
A hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013. that the Federal Reserve could "muffle" its monetary expansion has sparked market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that the heads of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and with experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "rather art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "the history of the Federal Reserve has had cases of overreaction to the movements of the financial market that do not seem to be related to economic principles."
Lacker, a member with the voting rights of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "notwithstanding the limited identifiable effects on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the Federal system canceled these declines.
The Federal Reserve should be put first to take care of stability only in times of big crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the interest rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic did not get close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared by rising rates because markets are going through shock," Posen, president of the Institute of World Economy, said. Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should be ahead of events.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees poured into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar in the framework of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?" - he wondered.
"Surely someone assumed and knew that the flow of refugees, these miserable and disadvantaged people who are fleeing from death, will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Did the political leaders of Europe speak out frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally swapping their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO is trampling on many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked and looks at how the military boots sewn according to NATO standards are being trampled on moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law.
Government troops and loyal paramilitary groups are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The United States supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
The official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the hostility of the West to Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive its partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin urged the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic state."
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if it leaves - then at the request of the people, and not by decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communique.
"If the people want them to stay - the president remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking about the military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, the economy and the military.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igil coalition, led by the United States," - said Assad.
The death toll exceeded 230,000, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State," banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States strikes on the positions of the Islamic State from the air.

US Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters, citing the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.

The sides discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper slander Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenta.ru."
The note in the Washington Post is beautiful because everything is completely turned out.
Former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "walked out" from the territory of the Donbass republics in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three cars of money that is attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodya, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really was.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," - said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "linked."
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Strelkov left himself," Borodai said.
"This is a slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post appeared an article that quotes Borodai that he took Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to bind his companion.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers began to cut down trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the veracity of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian voivodeship Tomasz Smolarz suggested that new evidence of the existence of a train with gold is not more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Polish Deputy Minister of Culture Pyotr Zhukhovski said that local treasure seekers with "probabilities of 99 percent" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovskiy noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhikh with a message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The main narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The main narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugene Brun noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, the drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said live radio station "Moscow Speaks," commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens younger than 21 years.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Psychologically, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally maturing only by the age of 21," Brun said.
Earlier, Sultan Khamzayev, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Sober Russia," told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit when selling alcohol and "agnas together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development," the correspondent of Sib.fm familiarized with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal said that on August 26, 2015 he bought a Bible published in the "Read City" store on Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development."
On September 16, the statement was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
It's not about banning a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very thorough problem that will stir up society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which he did not do before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Riu Grandi promotes healthy food for breastfeeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method with which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of infants sucking, painted with images of harmful food.
Breastmilk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs, pregnant women and births are recommended to increase the daily rate of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that one calorie increase is not the only change in the diet that mothers need to make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Bayerl College of Medicine in Texas, found that the healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents the development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, there was a negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system.
Under Hamburg, the train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, realizing that he could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, there was a clash in front of their eyes.
One of the students filmed him in the video.
Because of the emergency, there was a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the sidelines.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, by a miracle no one was injured, except for one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali's victory in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children.
This is the second death rate among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but better, from her point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is uninthant, - said the vice-president of the organization Stephen Parnis. the
But in the form in which boxing exists now, there will always be situations where the athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practicing doctors and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin urged the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The speaker of the state Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called unacceptable the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We assess this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because this is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA members to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's put morals back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return the humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The two things never ended in good," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian state Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to concentrate on the following specific tasks in ensuring security.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that we must pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," he said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory of a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SUBENKOV.
He managed at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to win at the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly - become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "Diamond League," taking the third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Is the season not over yet?
Yes, I'm going to play at the World Military Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.
However, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than we drift every week.
You said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September - a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season boiled, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressuring.
You can compete for pleasure, on "relax."
Plus you know, and the vacation is coming soon...
Are you tired?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue by the end of the season is always accumulating.
It doesn't matter what he did more - I won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moving - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get physically and emotional.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
What's in there - I'm just happy!
When you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, you come back often?
It happens.
You journalists don't let me forget it.
But in general, I believe that the bad athlete who lives with old victories, scrolls through his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed a couple of days and we'd like to go on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started to prepare in December, but the winter competitive season I missed.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then at home again.
It's all the same as usual.
But the coach set the task: try to reach a new level, which I have not been to.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, we did exercises on general physical training, which included both thrust, and squatting, and we pumped back.
Then they began to work for barrier training, a lot of technical equipment.
How did the opponents watch?
I always try to do it, there is no problem with this in the age of the Internet.
I watched the winter European Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the entire pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought, you have to do something, dilute this company.
With each start this season, you added and added results.
Did it give confidence?
I have all the last seasons on a similar pattern.
There's no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always untwist my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel ready for feats, and at the competitions it is not always possible to show your readiness.
What was it like at the London Olympics?
To be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. "NO") tried to forget immediately.
I was very good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would have become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But I'm not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What's the matter?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get to the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right from the utribene, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to tear and carry with breaking your head - it means not to run anywhere.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, they reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold"!
How can it be possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to disconnect?
This is the hardest.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to put on barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most high, when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to be working on it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the outskirts after the first serious success seek to move closer to the capital.
Never had that thought?
It's better at home anyway.
I can't imagine where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
It might be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
C Klevtsov you've been together for a long time?
From the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
More precisely, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
The children's all-around was - it's when they throw the ball, jump in length from the place.
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
That's how it stayed.
Was there ever fear of barriers?
It was possible to negotiate with them immediately.
But I've always had a lot to work on the technique.
There's a lot of acceleration over how much he suffered!
But you can't get away from this routine.
The technician must be honed constantly - so that at night I can be awakened, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't revisit my races, and I couldn't resist.
But we need to work on efficiency - there is no limit to perfection.
Are you not afraid that the victory for the year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you choose this road, I must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, no extra load should be felt.
I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvilla
Well, I am not so naive that I am amazed at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, their bread is not forget - give, plant the enemy.
And although I did not wear the flag, and the same, exactly the same, said a million times here, and directly the bastard did not call anyone - another touched me.
All my pseudo-friends in a moment, somewhere evaporated somewhere.
The pressing I am exposed to is so strong that even I saw the kinds of boys, I think people are white.
As if he was walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd and muted to bars.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'll give you a howitzer, old I'm, guys, afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so you'll bite.
And to give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson, only idiots can.
It's better for me, the best journalist, the job is unfamiliar.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili in a sharp form described the Crimean events:
What happened to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something, in no way fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and picking up his living space...
The war from the Kremlin went, and it will only end there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin's prison.
I have guesses who it might have been...
Kobzon does not have much to live.
I don't understand he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Will he lose the apartment?
Well, a monument was demolished.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting their small homeland.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite the Ninth's attempts to highlight the loss of leaders in the Today Show
The raid by Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the release of the place of the leader could not greatly raise the rating of Today.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Competitor - Sunrise - with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture doesn't seem much to be important for Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience of 37,000 spectators in the top five Bigger Cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today scored a little more than on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators against 314,000 Today.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
The winds of change are more affected than the Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa's okay, thank you for the clarification!

Important news for the Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with the former release of Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 spectators.

The three finalists are unanimous that Sam Wood's "Bachelor" is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret uncovered? . . . .
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snezhan Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win the "Bachelor."
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in the "Bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who have reached the final, of course, remain silent about who received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow" Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellowes on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they may have given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood is silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the ideal man, mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
But with your answer to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" They could involuntarily tell you which of them really won the heart of the "Bachelor."
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski, without doubt, called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
A good relationship has been established between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
"Since I was among the participants, I felt the energy (Sara) and energy of Sam and understood that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jevons-Fellowes.
"Sarah is a very open person, it is easy and fun with it," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is a attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the same person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who to choose Voodoo, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.

I both like the same girls, and Snezhana and Lana deserve it equally.

Jarridd Hein had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in them after his move to the United States - as well as many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hein on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian rugby league allowed on the first return of the pant in the winning game with the "Minnesota" with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hein another opportunity to return the pants, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself from the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of arrogating the beginners in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at a press conference after the match.
A 49ers club spokesman Cam Inman said Hein also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGow, who advised him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrider Hayne lost the ball on the return of the punt by the Minnesota Wikits during the first quarter
At this start of the debut in the NHL, Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count.
It was seen how Hayn was fighting after losing the ball, and he later told the host of the show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio 2DayFM 104.1, which could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for his career in the NFL.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game and that's all," Haine said.
Hein compared his miss to his debut in the Origin game series in 2007, when the ball in his standings zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hein was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.

On the border of Hungary there were clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees staged protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Resque, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at the police and try to demolish the fence installed at the border.
Reinforcement has been sent to the scene, the police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants ran to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, according to the BBC.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for considering asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the transfer to the Hungarian armed forces of the functions to protect the border of the country's parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a fence with a barbed wire with a length of 175 km on the border with Serbia to deter the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
Accused of the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspired to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about the collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
"Respondents like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a fine of a million dollars.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, perhaps, will reduce his term.
The sentence to Drinkman will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The last pleading guilty to the crimes he incriminated.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk backed by Russia's Bashar al-Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad is at risk of exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the State Department said in a statement.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fight the Islamic State group (which is banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened to isolate Russia because of the support of the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic state."
Recently, the media often reported the presence of Russian servicemen on the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and help the Syrians to master equipment to use it against the Islamists.
Four killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, a spokesperson said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishno Prasad Daqal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Daqal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before the rubber bullets were used.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last in weeks of fierce protests in weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where the madezi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally administered for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted in favor of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new head would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of "Regional."
Oleg Valerievich, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of the local budget.
Then an audit of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document circulation to five days.
Previously, the papers on the authorities could go for months.
Measures were developed to improve the revenue base and optimize costs.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no design and estimate documentation (PSA) in the city on any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the POD on the roads, kindergarten, northern sewer collector and water.
Road work in the two areas is underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens in the city?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics have not been observed in the city in the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most relevant.
From September 1, it closed for major repairs of kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, and the program "People's Initiatives" was also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children aged one and a half to three years.
We don't have queues for children from three to seven.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, of the Sayan enterprises, and they need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is put into operation.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand. The sq.m. There are a lot of accommodation who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand. rubles for one square meter, this cost includes the finish "turnkey."
If we cope with the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which was sold for a priceless price in 2004.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the social partnership institute developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 agreements of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "Vostok-Center," Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, LLC "Sayansky broiler," LLC "PC MDF," the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Immediately on the Day of the city of LLC "Sayansky broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in therapies with children, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the day of the city colorfully.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban collectives and organizations.
An chronicle of the city, a book by the Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded anniversary medals.
The mentors also participate in the work of the city charity fund.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000. rubles is aimed at supporting talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, support for children from low-income families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There are not enough doctors and teachers-subjects in the city.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance to provide specialists with housing.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a program to allocate housing with the ability to privatize it in five years.
The plans include the redevelopment of the building, which will build eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family."
In the future - the construction of a house for employees in the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a workable team in the city, with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important of all crises to draw the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is large.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the increase in prices.
The state Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Romyantsev - also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
Indexing of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.

Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aids helping flooding European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masood, who ran with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on dubious trains and buses, we were starving, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be handed over to four non-profit organizations involved in the assistance of refugees and migrants: "Doctors Without Borders," the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first 5.5 million. Dollars donations until the amount on the page google.com/refugeerelief reaches 11 million. The dollars.
Europe is opposing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused by the most part four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity can help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of obesity in people with low obesity who suffer from type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that diabetics with little obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The death rate is not immediately apparent," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the editor's column, JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organizations to digest food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, weight measure relative to height, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
The BMI of 25 or higher suggests that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach abyss and sleeve gastroectomies, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low obesity.
The average BMI in those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partially 28%.
In the group that received drug treatment, for comparison, the complete cure for diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors say.
The researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin levels in the blood that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control rates reflected by good A1c hemoglobin levels have not reduced the death rate in five years, according to research manager Dr. Chi-Ceng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
On the fifth year, compared to the group that had heated a sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in the BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to complete diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in the city. Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric interference, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here, as it claims that such surgery is safe in a group with low BMI where there is an increased risk of death or renal disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out fur coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchi, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people through the open entrance door entered the house located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Robbery."
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to come up with how to resettle all guests of the city.
The interlocutors of "Rosbalt" believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the primacy, each hotel of St. Petersburg must undergo the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not answer the antimonopolists.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens, placing one or another number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will take all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand. The rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy committee for the development of tourism Nana Gvichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have been classified - so many inspections were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by an amazing coincidence of circumstances is unknown.
That is, the past classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
"For the last six months, hotels have not really sought to undergo the classification," admitted the Director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which did not include the cost of inspections, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand. Rubles and more.
But still, recently the heads of hotels intensified and began to apply for the classification, Shadskaya assured.
The hotels need to have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not even receive the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee for the room in the hotel will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This was done in order to prevent the rise of prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and prevent a two or three-fold increase, but hotels need to be allowed to earn money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," - explained the President of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than an unbridled rise in price," he said.
It is not clear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the state Duma introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Guachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close about 80% of hostels, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand in them. The rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there are not enough two- and three-star hotels that are in demand by football fans, but there is a skew towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "at the 80,000th stadium sits 75 thousand vips."
This can be corrected just by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers "idioticism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can't."
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, I agree that it is wrong.
But as a hotel, to which guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup and because of their slowness.
As many as hundreds of small hotels simply will not have time to pass the classification, and the pit is digging themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
"There are not many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less paid orders from the mini-hotel, and will choose those that are more expensive," - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of checks passed at the moment is much higher than the St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is associated, among other things, with constant changes in the tourist bloc of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, which is likely to have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can mobilize the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come in the vans, where you can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that then they are empty," - said Gennady Lamshin.
Also very popular during the football championship will be used by rented housing.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of rented apartments.
The rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"Of the obvious - the first to leave the house near the stadium," - said the specialist on the lease of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research Larisa Bragin.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only tell the road, but can also hold a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My dadd in the 1970s in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult with hotels at that time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the residents of the city - to call to your home fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the state Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "sleaked" the Amur region.
With admiration today I looked at the clown Zhirinovsky in the state Duma.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The topic of the speech, it seems, is "the LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
It does not shake with protocols - for there is nothing; there are no other protocols, except those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the elections!"
And immediately he attacks on Rodnina, and then, after a fight with the chairman, takes the faction from the meeting room, screaming literally "You are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes not Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insults.
Really, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another antics of Zhirinovsky in the style of "The Fallows!," and not a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scanned, and the elections, according to the party's website and Faisbuku Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader obviously peeps off.
Gives the dead on the Amur to bury their dead, and he himself preaches the gospel against "United Russia" in general and innocent Ronnina.
An elegant decision, so that the face does not lose, and in a real, not ostentatious scandal do not go.
Another thing is that now in a strange situation is Abramov himself.
In addition to the screams from the authorities, he did not wait, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for a narrow circle, it was he who became a formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, ham attacks on the EP and ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a pariah that successfully used its own party leadership and super-irritant for the same ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
For sure - there would not be Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully watched.
Trump is still growing and growing up.
The news appeared that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.
That is, the bath fell from nothing.
The only thing that Abramov was buried under him.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are the homeland of refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched upon the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is not possible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying the U.S. reaction triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who swallowed a hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010, the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a hand sanitizer high in alcohol, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gailor Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of ingestion by children under 12 years of age of fluids for hand disinfection reported to toxicology centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some of them are sent to the ambulance," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or a dispute for social media.
The videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
Reportedly, teenagers mixed disinfectant liquid with alcohol-containing mouthwash liquid to get a stronger drink.
Children of younger age can attract pleasant odors of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attracted (disinfecting fluids for hands) are those that are flavored.
There are disinfectant hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive for children.
The disinfectant fluid for the hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't leave a drink of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in sight, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naidja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry hand disinfectant at a school of about four sprays, was sent to the ambulance department at school.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and couldn't walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors observed her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, because because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, mother of Naigi, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition, cleaning to remove disinfectant fluids from the area of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after being swallowed a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three quadrus students in northern New York conspired to poison their "opposite" teacher by "distributing antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher's allergy is a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she forbade them to be kept in class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty conversations," and address issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library. N.K. The rusple is sad by the cast-iron owl.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed it with candy.
He has been in this library for generations for 95 years.
The first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes and were copied with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her children's photo to her children's friends once.
And when the Barnaul people were asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to her name, she wrote that she did not, and did not mind.
Letters have long been dusting in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library.
In the years of perestroika, different people often called, they were outraged: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without a political coloring!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "lenin" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path of yellow brick.
The Wizard of the Emerald City is the artist's favorite theme of Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all other managers was distinguished only by love for drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mom Has Cancer."
Olya did the illustrations, and I thought that life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But we are readers of children, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - says the "Russian planet" the director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we even have such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exposition.
Once in the quarter, new photos of readers are posted, who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is rejoicing that with the children began to come dads more and more often.
If at the age of two the child read Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more difficult.
But now there is a law under which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with them - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of ylons with yats and ers, the novel by Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva," the lining "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book," we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they rest on their legs, do not want to leave.
Often mothers come with strollers - and we are pleased that the library they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says that modern children, as we once, love classical children's literature:
"The publishing business is developing, and much attention is being paid to the authors who are the connecting link between generations."
And if we talk about small children, then it is important to them that there is some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books should be paid attention to and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
To take books outside the reading room is prohibited for adults.
This magic privilege is only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the book depository.
Steps will creaking under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet as an old comrade: hello, it's good that you and I are not changing.
Ellie still also cheerfully walks on the road paved with yellow brick, lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish did not say to the damned bourgeois War Mystery - such a firm word he has.
Books like passwords, you can learn your own from them anywhere.
There are real booksales in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of novins with yawns and ers.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva."
Or the lining of "Murzilki" for 1936.
Time has grown the page, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer given to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of everything - I will retire and take rare children's books.
But the children will not be on this, so to speak, will not lead: and the colors in old books are not very bright, and the themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write out this "Pioneer's truth?"
But it was still interesting, - Galina Ilyasova, the head of the book depository, tells the "Russian Planet."
The pages of "Murzilka" darkened from the time.
Galina Vasilyevna manages the book storage all her life.
She knows what color Buratino's cap is, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's team at the Curdich Championship, in what situations Carlson uses the silencer for the motor, and who works the father of Alice Selezneva.
For the work of the librarian pay little, and everyone who can live without these books, very quickly find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: enlighteners, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books: as a librarian I like, that they were, so that they stand exactly and beautiful on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that books will always be, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
The rumour mill: There are no disagreements in Celtic
Griffiths denied conversations about Celtic disagreements after Dale's admission that Hups was in a bad situation, but he would correct it.
The Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could break the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Celtic" to five points
The Penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half gave "Aberdeen" a small advantage over "Hamilton" in Pittodra, which allowed the "Dons" to break away from "Celtic" by five points.
Griffiths denied talk of disagreements
This sparked rumors of Celtic's controversy, which were thwarted by Griffiths, saying he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic as he didn't compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "In Holland, the most attractive moments of Celtic games no longer show, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the "Old Firm."
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the games of the "Old Company," and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat of Malmo and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 players of Aberdeen, who now, breaking five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said: "Silitka has had bad periods before, and we'll be back again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
And so are we, but we have to go on.
And we really really need Celtic's support because players are getting much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warburton with distrust awaits January transfers
Despite the opinions that appeared just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warburton distrusts the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford striker said: "The Yanvar transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Micha, who is interested in "Celtic," hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Micha, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with Lebeds.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts are going to confront the SFA about Neilson's statements
"Harts" led with a score of 2:1, when the removed Paterson, and began to lose 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later canceled; this is the third red card of the Collum, canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up his words, saying, "I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyunksle
The stubborn player of the team "Hybernian" was reprimanded after admitting that he sang the song with abusive words about the former player "Harts" Rudy Skazel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby on Tyranksle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," the striker said, adding, "I can safely say that I wasn't going back to Tytansl if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in Dundee United management
Donnelly argues that the board of directors of Dundee United is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad that "ugly" won against "Hamilton"
Derek McInness admitted that his team "Aberdeen" had to fight desperately against "Hamilton Assis" to achieve the seventh consecutive victory in the league championship, which put them five points above "Celtic," at the top of the standings, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInness said: "There is no team here that would win something - a cup, or a league championship that didn't win in this way."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
SUPPFE ASES in Scotland remained at 164,000 people between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million. for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the level for the United Kingdom at 5.5%, as the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell for the quarter to 74.0% - above the average figure of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Affairs Secretary David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why I'm a Witness of the Execution in Oklahoma
Today, evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch how a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be on the death row at the Oklahoma State Prison, where Richard Glossip is executed with lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
With the approach of this day, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since the crowd often more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of places for the press was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had my own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness at the same time and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter that I was acting in my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated better," but still believes that I'm wrong with what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something that I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he was talking.
I told him he could take me off his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the pagpoints I've recorded.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez makes him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I am confident that evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that point out, I'll see him die.
I can't say I'll be totally objective.
There will be other reporters to contact.
From me you will know what it's like - to watch as a person I like die without the need.
Persecuted by the police persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The constable from the town of Canning-Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to go ashore."
The Cunning-Weil police were called on Tuesday to enter someone else's territory in Bakkingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to escape from them, rushing to Canning.
But he didn't swim far.
"He was standing in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's grab me," said Senior Sergeant Chandell Castledine.
Constead Laclan Perchavez did not really want to wet the shape, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try and run away," says Sergeant Castlenein.
Football champion Ben Cousins was exactly what I remembered.
In 2006, Cousins moved to the ditch to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim in Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but encouraged the locals to invent the joking "Ben Cousins' biathlon."
Peter Moody Accuses Steward of Spying and Threatens to Leave Equestrian Sports
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt to infiltect the spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the equestrian sport immediately.
His target was stewards and ethics officers at Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatay due to a violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he is always making every effort in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive result of Lidari's cobalt sample, which he can't explain.
He held the language about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "looking like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I endured for a long time, but sometimes it knocks you out so much that you don't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy in his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would name if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I'm doing in my stable," Moody said.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If so, they should all of them no doubt apply, because the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Ralston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, RVL's chief executive, have known all the time and are known now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL have to be brave and hold accountable for what's going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that's true.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and put them responsible for making a decision.
I have support from the family and I can leave.
The coach's adoration only grew in a long investigation into the case of cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say that he could "bump his license on the table."
Moody, best known for having prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's feet, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules in the races.
"I have to be fully responsible for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made her a compress on her leg.
She could have had a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, about which the stewards opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who crashed and fled from the scene in Cobra, arrested
The police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobra over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to assist and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy parried accusations of rivals in the use of hard power tricks
The coach of "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellam called the criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as "imposing the agenda" from two favorites of the NRL championship.
The coach of "Sydney Rusters" Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the "Storm" to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the qualifying final against the Nomeran Queensland Cowboys on the night of Saturday, when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and stated that two of Queensland's team weren't "too successful" with a hand.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were just focused on "contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident in the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of "Storm."
"It continues to pop-up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about hard receptions when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said.
I can vouch that we have not changed anything for a whole year in our defense systems or techniques, just over the past six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's clearly coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and for him it was a bit of a shock.
It's funny, as it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George Illavra Dragos won the 2010 championship, showing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was."
I remember that in 2010. "St. George" was criticized a lot, calling the boring team, and Wayne said that he does not care at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
It's football that you'd want to play when you have players like that.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such midfielders as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storm" and "Rusters" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cayouz."
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is that impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At the end of this week, the "Storm" at the end of this week's day off, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronal Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
The Serb accused of drug possession was released on bail of $ 200,000
A man who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine to smuggling to Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marco Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht through Vanuatu and moored in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is threatened with a life sentence for attempting to assign drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maximovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole party, and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about the place of his location.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovich was asked to make a joint bail of $ 200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the bail of $200,000 is too big a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.

It was a big game, - quotes AFP Katsikaris.

The newcomer of CSKA Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I've talked to coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team," Freeland said. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in the defensive constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can cope with this.
Yes, I will need some time to renovate the position of the center, after all, in the NBA I played a forward more.
Now we will need to face more centered opponents, but I have already done this before, so I think, and now I can cope.
The last time the army won the Euroleague was in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but they could not show their best basketball every time.
It's an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSKA's year.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to be in search of images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she slept, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found him in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew her mother's attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, and then examined the computers found at the address and found "appropriate" searches in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "provide pedophiles," and then he "pretends that he was a policeman to scare them."
Authorized bailiff Aleid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He stated that this is an addiction, he was fascissed to scare people.
He admitted that he made requests on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to the police to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown man who sent him the images, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and wept.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then the accused was held a face-to-face bet.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating the bail conditions on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to put Hogg on the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it can be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October, before receiving certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was taken into custody before the hearings on the other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of persons who committed crimes of a sexual nature even before the date of the sentencing.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is giving the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest state leader, fell down the stairs leading the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread through social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them from whispering Mugabe during the appeal.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was Mugabe's speech that repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Goose, a member of parliament for the Democratic Movement, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled "Death,"" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned of the members of Parliament that immunity ended in the parliament building and as soon as they were out, parliamentary immunity did not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tswangirai, is "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its program to steer and reduce service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing sectors of hardware and service operations.
The estimated reductions in jobs will amount to approximately 2.7 billion. US$Since the fourth quarter, said in a statement by Hewlett-Packard.
"Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard now, and the portfolio of business lines will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing requests of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than 50 billion. U.S. dollars and "will be focused on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions" to companies," the company said in a statement.
So the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment, is divided; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large-scale reorganization in order to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world's second personal computer maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that, if Wilshire's recovery was planned, nothing would stop him from returning to the game for Christmas.
With the most favorable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championships next summer remains in question.
The most indestructible in this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season preparation.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
This has nothing to do with the ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the situation for Arsenal wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, which are the most missed due to injuries of the days.
Wenger admits the likelihood of getting stuck in a vicious lap, but Arsenal believe that improving injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes you are vulnerable to fire after the injury - during this time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and he can handle it.
I hope that he will recover physically, I am sure of it, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with a match with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting line-up will play Mathieu Debussy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giraux instead of Nacho Moral and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the undisputed favorites in Group F, the Maxim Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
"Dynamo" have not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson received last season, when the team was defeated in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"This is an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never done that.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of men's friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate the need for men has become of frankness, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to happen than women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of "Campaign against unfortunate life" declared 2015 the Year of men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if the patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of cure doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for the friendship to work, first of all, it is necessary that it be.
In an era where communications are managed by social media, when style prefer content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life is doubling the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if loneliness actually reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noticed, for money you can not buy more happiness.
Friends's advantage is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters was determined not through their own work, but rather through a person who manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey's humor and the constant hug of Chandler, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's sighs on Rachel - everything comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens said to me: "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support goes from the circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you have fully restored the scenery for the holiday, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better - if in Starbucks you see a lonely person, smile and say "Hello."
Don't guess what kind of friendship can benefit.
The series Friends is shown on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, tag "FriendsFest"
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG to defeat "Malmyo"
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidy and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored in the goal of Malmo.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with a very convenient 2-0 win against Malmo at Park De Prince on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player began to set a direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in group A, Paris had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, because they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but on the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against the team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at the Champions League, so winning with a score of 2:0, delivering problems to the opponents and playing well in defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to work during the season," Blanc said.
That's a lot of promise.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury in one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2:2 in a match with Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was pushed back to the background of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe, after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why he ran out in the pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmo and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johana Villand in the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected an easy and great victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two support midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the blow of Nikola Giurdzhic, in which the ball flew past the far bar of the goal of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
But PSG at times failed itself with inconclusive transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half could not implement at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he showed himself much more skillful in the exact passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who received who, Di Maria sent a swivel blow, which was robbed to the barbell by Viland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had regarding the return to the game, and only Wiland's interception of the ball from close range did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before the replacement Esekjele Lavessi was counted as a goal at the end of the match.
Coach of "Malme" Agee Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
"Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to Paris!
It was a wonderful match with them.

Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of OJSC "Mogilevliftmash," receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, taking into account the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I would add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade and delivery of modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for the run-up of many promising projects, including the work of the honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow us to solve many problems directly and quickly, shooting their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the groundwork, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effy Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight show on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you are casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Stunned Brown, not counting his ears, resentfully exclaimed "Wow! Oh, my worth it. Well-well" all the time, while the actor from the "Martian" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like the participants - no matter who the director - wondering what interpretations of Harmony's image they're going to stick," Brown said.
The only black character is a prostitute beat by a white pimp.
The film's film producer Dear White People advocated that the film was directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was abruptly opposed, saying that "they can't get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments on Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angrily about the video: "Explanatory to the essence of the diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room WHITE WHITE that is painful."
The tweet has more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's statements appear just when competent coverage of the racial topic in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a 2014 teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the applicants in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
"Alcons still matter," he said.
Like black books and the lives, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be treated as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders of the movement said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards first champion
A professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior," taking home a prize of $ 1 million.
On this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet been able to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the finale of the season, two members - Culdiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing a 75 feet long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the task first and sat down at a given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, who passed the debilitating stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task as much as three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After the victory, which got with incredible work, Caldiero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview to "E!News."
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never made money and lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! Such a serious leap in income.
And suddenly such a thing... I never even imagined how it happens. The future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first passed the track, will not receive any money prize.
According to the rules, the money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the finishing players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," - said Wed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurtful about that.
He's happy with what he did.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was destined to lose to someone, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we switched roles.
The "America Ninja Warrior" show will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
"Detertret Tigers" quietly bypass "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAFULIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, the Tigers are now the last in the American League's central division.
Claiming to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly won on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with a total of 5-4 on the Target Field.
"Twins" missed the chance to reduce half-game lagging behind "Houston Astros" and take second place in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.

It was only his third high-quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good performance," Simon said.
Pitchers on the replacement can not quit in every game, and so I want to go deeper into the game.
Appointed "Tigers" Victor Martinez managed to beat three blows and achieved two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three beats since four beats in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," Osmus said.

Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracted Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured before the game itself, missing for more than a month due to lumbar inflammation.
"It's not certain that I'd like to start," Hughes said, "but as the game evolved, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.

Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play the pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Learning to God" entered the Yuzhno-Sakhalin court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsky City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Let's Day to God: its significance and place in Islam," Interfax reports with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants in the trial.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the state Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such stupidities," he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalin city prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material."
An appeal came from the prosecutor's office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not verses from the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," - said Chukhray.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotes from the Qur'an - "You worship and We pray for help," "Do not call on anyone along with Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision on the book "Shaitans and provocateurs."
Deputies of the state Duma, he called for a legislative ban on judicial decisions relating to the texts of the sacred scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law under which it is prohibited to make judicial decisions concerning directly the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
The leadership of Facebook intends to fight against the manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network, together with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve of the head of the department Heiko Maas said that at present the Ministry of Justice together with specialists of the social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the deletion of their record.
Organizations whose specialists are engaged in the collection of complaints from insulting from users of the social network should also contribute to the operational blocking of illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of justice of Germany was made after xenophobic sentiments increased sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that swept the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany today, all the items intended for the accommodation of refugees are overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily relocate migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, in which prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
At the Moscow cemeteries there will be zones for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoe, Domodedovskoe, and Shcherbinsk Cemetery.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troyekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such sites will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budgetary institution "Ritual."
The relaxation zones will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors of cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the zones for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butovsk and Shcherbin cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual," if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and areas, allotted directly for burial sites.
Experts of the GBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the outbursts at the graves.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" spoke about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to learn GPS-coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services, depending on the time of year.
So, digging the grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of funeral services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
In the Lenna forests, five days later, a lost fungus was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest more than a hundred hours without provisions.
It was possible to find the grimy-mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest.
No food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was able to find after the helicopter was connected to the search work.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for heels and pickers, but did not return by evening.
Relatives immediately appealed for help, and the next day in search of the fungus were raised rescuers and caring residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the detachment of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
I've gone very far, completely different.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He walked a great distance at his age.
Miracle was still alive.
The mushrooms were taken to the Lening Central District Hospital without consciousness, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days spent in the forest, doctors do not know at all.
Valentina Nepsha, Head of the Therapeutic Department of the Lernin CRB: "Attempted examination to the patient, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich every year comes to Smolensk region from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had previously been collecting mushrooms, but he never went deep into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: "Forest near the road, in principle not local."
Literally for several years came to visit, to visit relatives.
Well, go get the mushrooms.
I guess I went a far and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Only in the last few days, five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: you need to walk in the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and compasses.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces so that you can then go back.
The An-2 sat down on a slit in the fraternal taiga.
Right on the slit sat in Siberia, the emergency An-2.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties, but the plane itself received significant damage during the landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, the co-pilot and flight mechanic, reports "Interfax."
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Brotherly Transport Prosecutor's Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.

On the liner failed engines and onboard electronics, but the crew did the impossible.
On board the aircraft were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in the emergency landing of the plane.
The Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have helped to reduce inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, said the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the Higher School of Economics, Nobel Prize laureate in economics 2007. Eric Maskin.
In the last 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these forecasts have come true in many ways," Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have received serious GDP growth per capita.
However, not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would shorten the gap between the "hustle" and the "undesup" in poor countries, which manifests itself in a large income inequality, or rather, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets haven't reduced inequality in emerging economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by HSE.
Together with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin, has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income differences in poor countries increase as globalization grows, recalls I.E.
There are specific processes in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin highlights four levels of qualification - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries do not have enough qualifications to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if the C-level workers from poor countries" salaries are growing due to cooperation with B employees from the rich, then D workers do not feel growth or their salaries are falling at all.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and consequently increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskins are proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, Head of the Department of Mathematics at HSE.
And like every powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Muskin believes.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no case calls for the halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth.
Derbent: a live connection of times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Churches, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.

In Domodedovo there was a business "game at the airport."
In the capital, they are experiencing a new form of training.
Four hundred students have tried themselves as airport staff.
For this, in Domodedovo mounted models of three aircraft harbors.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it is not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the real airport is hell.
For the one that settled in the Domodedov hangar - a standard set of tasks that will have to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar, three large airports from different countries of the world fit at once.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the domestic world of the air harbor.
Passengers registration, air baggage service - they were trusted even by buses on the flight field, ladders and inspection of passengers.
Passengers are totally problematic.
One trick with documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the shortest time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline has paid them the corresponding amounts for the flight service.
"For failure to perform the relevant tasks, a fine is being recovered from them," explains financial analyst of the game Dmitry Khilko in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
The events are closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of training.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American center operating at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library. M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times cast doubt on the commitment of the Russian government to ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments of the long history of relations between our countries," US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and lasting connections between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.

A typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatter Kumar's table, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order so you could make fun of him," Kumar says. the
If there is at least another brick, we will order to demolish all the existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has heard more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in 60 years since the independence of the enhanced industrial development, India has evolved from a country of virgin jungle to one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large megacities, where the development of infrastructure does not keep up with the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the remaining residential areas are cut down for new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unfull."
Sometimes the court's decisions are really impossible to execute within the time limit set by the court, environmental lawyer Raj Pandjwani confirms.
However, impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least, they make the responsible persons move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled large construction sites: on its account, the cessation of the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polled the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their job," commented Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of the judge's pen.
So, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years of entry to the capital, which caused popular outrage.
Despite the sharply fallen popularity and flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government about the vehicles entering and leaving, and also proposed to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously found out in the factories whether they were able to fulfill a similar order.
As the court's focus began to fall into the scope of pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principal judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, with the pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a Hindu-holy river, the judge often ceases to restrain his emotions and switches to scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges to the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge gets heated. the
You keep polluting the river because you think the Ganges is Gang, he'll take all our sins.
It's the river we worship and see what you do to it every day.
The Ganges clean-up is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million swimmers in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Rescue Fund money from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the costume was bought for $700,000, while at least eight billion are required to clean up the river.
Proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India has yet to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury," said Malaika Bhanot, an activist for Call Ganga. the
And the court is trying to find the golden mean between ecology and development."

Xi calls for making economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to the group facing the challenge of leading the reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of investor access to the market, changing the rules of border control, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) attracting private capital and revising the system of registration of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually depleted through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the rule of law in the business sphere and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also ease control of the powers conferred on companies, ensuring that companies operate their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "grin-card," will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the provision of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
