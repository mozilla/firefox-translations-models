The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using a social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region has changed.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the benefits for travel in public passenger transport and give a scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application change.
So, the replenishment limit is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in the summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the owners of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel reimburses the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card by funds remains the same - in the period from 24 of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new procedure for travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
So, it becomes possible to keep a detailed record of spending money on a social card with an accuracy of kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return the credited, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half the cost of travel is paid by a citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged when making money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using the social card, more than 470 million rubles are provided.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a call at 911, the teacher confesses the murder of a friend
During a 911 vote call almost without tremors, university teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed employees who would come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there is a “song” in the house that is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note that was carelessly written by hand on a white sheet of lined paper: “I’m sorry if I wanted to bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me,” the memo said, according to representatives of the authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who led two online courses at the University of Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by that time had managed to go 300 miles to the university campus, where, according to the police, he shot and killed all of Ethan Schmidt’s respected history teacher on the doorstep of his office.
LynnBaford, police chief at the University of Delat States, said the university learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made that true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the body officers were still trying to put in one picture the motives that booed Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped make a portrait of a talented but possibly a concerned teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, said that he did not have charges of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude to the “beautiful people” with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the occurrence of problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the school year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb previously asked the University of Delta to give him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university admission rules meant that the degree of doctor, which Lamb worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic post of teacher.
University President William Laforge said he was unaware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
Police attacked Lamba's trail after he escaped from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself from a caliber darling gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents’ house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson.
His car with a powered engine still stood on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received the degree of Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamba’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carla Heirton said she was 15 and Lamba was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends studied high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls were melting when he was there,” says Heirston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentisse at the time of events, apparently, have been dating for some time.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there’s no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the other side of which goes to the canal.
Police said the dog is fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but stayed friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but he heard Abigail from his daughter that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O’Steen said his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator in the dimly illuminated bar The Julep Room at the Gauthier suburb, said the last time he had seen Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and harpox for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and Colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the University of Delta University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in the candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony where the university chorus Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace were chooled.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis has been gone.
Today is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement to the police that Lamba's call was received by 911 after Schmidt's murder, and also because Lomb was not mentioned by Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, while the retailer of toys and goods for children assures that he will provide full-time staff and temporary employees with the opportunity to work more than an hour.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in stores and on wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than those 45 000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be with part-time jobs.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month and will increase the number of personnel from October to December.
Although the skies are still a few months, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film “Back to the future” was for Michael J. Fox is a grand event.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in a movie theater and waiting for the royal family to arrive, I noticed that the place is right next to me, and then I was sunny – Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in the trailer for the screening of the documentary “Back in Time”.
The film begins, and then it comes to my mind that I'm literally at arm's length and in one fake yun on a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film “Back to the Future” took place 30 years ago.
“For me,” says Spielberg, “it’s undoubtedly the greatest movie about time travel ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
The UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” for nearly a five-year conflict, and arms growth would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all participants, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council – the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation insoluble.”
Ban called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in resolving the nuclear program on Iran and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey, which show that Donald trump is not joking
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others waved away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some require a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the results of the polls, they have not succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously ask what this means for a real estate tycoon in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that in 2011, in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to his gaining popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won and one state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super Committee of Political Activity and the Economic Conservative Group’s Global Growth Club recognize Trump’s unbalanced strength and begin to pull out their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that a property tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for trump unfolded 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his $4th nominee in mid-June, a survey at the Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude to this tycoon in real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now positive about Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators win in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “engraved” or “satisfaction” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “unall” if he had become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “engraved” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
The next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “unsatisfied” or “off-random” if the electoral leader Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump’s temperament a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-prone voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington post poll on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the right person who can be effective in office, and nearly six of the 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their connoisseur hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who the most likely GOP winner was, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is not the case when four out of 10 put Jeb Bush in late July.
Full revelation: GOP voters had no right magical crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans had rallyed around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a scatter is likely to play against Trump’s advantage, and at the same time not supporting Trump are evenly distributed among the supportive of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one-one-one-person competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorin by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John CASich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's got a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
A little more than half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only half of the voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump’s toughest competition at the moment is with a colleague-outherr-outload, Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump over immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his speech, opening the campaign, the topic of immigration became the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s posturing will turn away key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts everyone’s attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The government is getting new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday, a new ABC/Post poll says they are more likely to want a political outsider than a man with experience in government.
They are also offended by Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activities in Congress, with 54 percent being “unfailed” and 21 percent “furious.”
The government will decide the fate of the indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports RG.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, while there is no final decision on the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that the society pays for him.
Earlier media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often annoyed and blushing the eyelids?
Answers the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The way out is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day cleanse the edges of the ages of the ages of what they have accumulated during the day for a day.
Cleansing procedures are not superfluously supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), diluting the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then by massage of the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out by circular movements of the finger pillows;
flushing the makeup, do not use alcohol-containing funds.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear submarines have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said that the country's main nuclear reactor - a nuclear complex in Yongbyon - is operating "at full capacity."
The message about this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK at any time is ready to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in number and quality”.
The latest nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that he managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem a mention of the fraternal peoples.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the meeting of the state Duma, reports “Russian news service”.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“Very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not stand,” said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all quatrains, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to “God Save the Tsar”, and replace the Russian tricolor with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad urged all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to cope with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but is that it is necessary to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
“That’s the essence of the refugee issue,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible, as long as people die, while the bloodshed continues and people do not feel completely safe.
“Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
Recall that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second world war.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic state”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city arranged a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
According to the authorities, about 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call significantly large figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90 thousand refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn debuts in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the ministerial session is expected to be very impatient
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister’s session, for the first time measuring forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will speak first of the six issues in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving their colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tred Junion Convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr. Corbyn said he was “respeciously silent” and acknowledged the “Royal Air Force’s heroism in the Battle of Britain.”
However, Mr. Corbina, member of the shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “independently” on his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economics, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party members supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences will also be “plunk” in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn’s appointment to the European Union and the government’s restriction of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at a conference of the Trade Unions that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at reversing the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labor and pension payments, said that the party had “complete clarity” that it was in opposition to government plans to reduce the upper limit from 26 000 pounds to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, with whom David Cameron will meet at the “copper box” in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he “attracts collective resources” in order to gain the ideas of questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30 000 sentences.
A member of the Parliament from the Islington North County stated that the Prime Minister's questions are causing excessive confrontation, and that he will refrain from witty answers and exchange of barbs, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the minister of economy in the shadow cabinet, will replace him with questions from the prime minister when he is absent – for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had appealed to House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
As he led in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of “fair marup” often associated with the prime minister’s procedure, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990. The prime minister’s questions have become a key indicator of the leader’s views, their ability to rule the House of Commons and a reputation for other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

Pound sterling rises as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose due to the proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
Growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as a transfer to an earlier date of forecasts for possible growth in quotations.
The pound sterling grew by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro, amounting to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against the general background, SABMiller shares were allocated, which increased by 20% thanks to a proposal for a purchase received from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Golsch.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9% amid encouraging news from a rival group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
Recent data on sales of Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - again began to grow.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant announced that it managed to receive 2.5 billion. dollars by placing stocks, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Mondi’s shares in the paper and packaging materials group were the leaders in the fall in the index – by 4.3% – after Goldman Sachs lowered the group’s rating to “sell”.
JD Sports shares rose after a sports clothing supplier company reported an 83 percent increase in profits to tax six months to 46.6 million. Pounds.
Chief JD Sports says higher salaries could prevent expansion
Peter Caugill, executive director of JD Sports, says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outgapix The increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metchash launches a campaign at the initiative from below to combat the onslaught of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
A wholesale food supplier, at the initiative of the bottom launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming Infusion of Aldi 700 million. dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events like “Adelaide Show”.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo’s from Dansborough, which offers a tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners who discount regular customers for South Australia Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29 – the day when this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will run its annual investor’s strategy day.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA brand stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Africa and 24 percent in WA, compared with about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening their first stores, picking up the sales volume from all the players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirut, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, achieving sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and sales of food at a high level of fixed costs of Metcash can cost the company about 13 million revenues before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kirut.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is with the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metchash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, downgrading the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamis Douglas, the founder of Magella Financial Group, told those present at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash “may likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglas’ comments.
But it is assumed that Metchash board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has decreased since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and Metash’s revenues from the food business, which the company supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational medibage and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $ 150 million annually to equalize retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths at a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers in remodeling retailers, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded food.
Metskash CEO Ian Morris says price equalization and refurbishment of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasia Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more honor than criticism for her behavior, as Tennis President Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", involuntarily found himself in the spotlight due to the shameful skirmish of Cyrijos with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinatti, the judge on the tower had to separate Cochkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison stated: "Wawrinka had to lay on the pips of Kiryos, and I have to put on the shoulder blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen as a breaker racket after a cramping spike in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy faithfully defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in singles in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against the UK.
“I am acutely worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was dragged into the conflict,” Healy said.
He really broke the racket when he got his foot on the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when the hopes were collapsing, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure that he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he owned itself very well in rather provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he is trustworthy.
He is surrounded by a great team, he has a beautiful family, and I just think he was a little dishonest.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, fits perfectly into the team, he never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he trains intensively, he is in great shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for the sake of an important match starting on Friday, relying on “mutual consent” the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not the debate around [Kirros],” Hoeley said.
And I think that Nick gained strength very quickly, as proving people like Federer and Murray, he grows up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he receives, but we are trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it is necessary, I believe, I believe, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can think about them, and this is best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detain migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed the border with Serbia at the southern border and detains those who are trying to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants pouring inside.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants accumulated on the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Having stuck indefinitely on the section of the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people who fled armed violence in their homeland, smashed tents and settled in this area.
However, the discontent was growing.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants from Hungary when they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the solution to the problem, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to have a common responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that the future (next month or the end of the year) an agreement will be reached according to which EU member states will accept another 120 000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded a meeting of the EU’s emergency summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for an early action by Brussels or neighbors.
The state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó said his country is also planning to Build a barbed wire fence on a section of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were involved in urgent work at the end of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “bottcepted place” and a crossing point for the EU’s border for immigrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees, victims of hostilities who have the right to protection, and this view points of view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, in t. h. Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force in Hungary at midnight are now considered a crime to intersection or damage to a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for those accused of trafficking.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” a government spokesman for Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Seded told reporters.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament is still to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been observing the presence of armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
György Bacondi, Orbán’s national security adviser, reported the capture of the authorities of 45 people who tried to cross the border at the border, and another 15 people were inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven aisles on the border with Serbia, bringing a rail car wristwicked to block one of the passages.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through inside.
Approximately 20 people managed to get inside, with thousands of people staying outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the abandonment of food and water until they were allowed to pass to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s Advantage over Bernard Sanders Damped to Behaladed in National Poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support for primordial Democratic voters (down to 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 2 percent (upwards from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to run in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of the primordial Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of rivalry in the primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate to support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choices than supporting other candidates.
Since CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has declined.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders lags behind her by only 5 points.
The preference given to Clinton by Democrats’ voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of 5 points in this group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she had become a candidate from the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because she was the candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic about her enthusiastically supported.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question, why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then – that now is the time of the president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about the association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called a statement on the issues and the chances of election.
As the vice president is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of primordial Democratic voters would like him to join the race — although a third believes he doesn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the candidates from the party, the primordial Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say that they would choose Biden second, it is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, answering the question of what is most important in the candidate, Democratic voters choose other options in addition to the chances of being elected.
Similar to last month’s situation, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an inextraorable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result in some key characteristics among the primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy by people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three is inclined to be honest, and Clinton’s strength is in her leadership.
Thirty percent of primordial Democratic voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27% do not have a definite opinion about it.
The primary Democratic voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as similar.
According to all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have any opinion about Sanders.
Although questions about the personal email box and the Hillary Clinton’s personal box and the server continue as her secretary, most of the primordial Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this did not adversely affect their general opinion about her.
But this is a completely different story in the American public at large.
Half of the Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinions about this were divided back in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over email did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton sees as honest and trustworthy voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are showing the best result of honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest person than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The limit of the error for the sample of 351 primordial Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates scored half of the vote in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose percentage of support increased from 23% in a recent CBS survey conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, ousting Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Casich, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Haqabee and Florida Senator Marko Rubio ranked third with 6%.
The limit of the error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent survey is plus or minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson’s rise in polls – showing support for 19% of Republicans, Trump’s with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post’s latest poll also found that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with the growing support for Carson last week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Killing Baruch College Death
Approximately two years after the student of the college died during the ritual of initiation into the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was brought against five people.
“Members of the P. Delta Psi Brotherhood from Baruch College brutally attacked Chan “Michael” Deng during the initiation rite in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital in time, which led to his death,” the police said.
Officials say a blindfold student and a 30-pound backpack behind their backs pushed several times while he tried to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited another hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
They, however, took the time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and get in touch with Andy Mengo, the national fraternity president, to ask for advice, as Chris Wagner, police chief Chris Wagner, told at a press conference.
“At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the brotherhood above Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Dong received several blunt head injuries, the trunk and hips.
“Too many families have been affected by the rituals of initiation into the fraternity, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970,” said Douglas Feyerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
The jury of Monroe was inclined to accuse the first five members of the murder.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will receive charges of violence against a newcomer and criminal collusion.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that authorized all this officially or unofficially,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch college banned the fraternity, and the national brotherhood excluded the local department from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the “probled market” will trip, the yield of bonds will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before it, and how long it will continue.
Specifically, history explains little about the time for the economy.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration is so insistently stressing that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the entire hustle and bustle around the rate hike is exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief specialist in the international economy at Capital Economics, in his comment to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to the more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the past month or so, the expectation of rate hikes can lead to instability for a while.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t look like stock revenues slowed down by 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years more often – about 14 percent – upwards to rate hikes, remains quite even within 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal state with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Dol, chief equity strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and stock revenues are beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist earlier and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point for the entire existence of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, raising rates since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it’s long, with only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question “whether it will be different this time,” Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve system all year, with their view of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe that the FOMC could approve rate hikes at this meeting, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all cycles of rate hikes have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage in GDP, overlapping the peaks that precede the recession, very quickly after the recovery began,” the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it lasts for 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is in some way similar to the one that is being implemented for the stock.
The fundamental difference is that in bonds the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal system changes the strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the onset of the first increase / reduction in rates in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in rates, the yield on bonds immediately falls,” Deutsche reports.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will lead to the fact that the yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds will become more flat, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often behave better in this climate, although “we are still afraid of fluctuations in yield,” said Katy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system’s policy.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all market characteristics with tightening the policy of the Federal system.
Generally speaking, companies that are leading their main business in the United States will benefit from raising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debts will be in a worse position, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt is more expensive in the financial sector.
“History shows that “qualitative” stocks demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of initial rate hikes,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Companies with a stable financial condition overtook companies with an unstable state according to the results of each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns, as well as low volatility, also showed better efficiency than low-quality stocks by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchanges, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see profit through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," said Andrew Bingham, a member of Parliament, a member of the Conservatives, "
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticizes station for ‘decrease in standards’
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is simply torn off with Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” MPs said, prompting the broadcaster to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seemed that a public radio station is “stupid” and becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 I don’t like using the word ‘simplification’ – but I think it’s turning into a Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brists under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that you’re the first to come to my mind, in which you’re actually only copying what’s already on the market,” said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC’s CEO denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don’t know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and making music doesn’t really match anyone else.
“Just really very important, I think Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio station had to work much more to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC brainchild that was attacked for assaulting commercial competitors during a special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Member of Parliament from Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of 22 million pounds.
See why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1, which involves Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made in the “typical style of the BBC”.
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in your own home stable” the next time she will launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money of those who pay the license fee to other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and the reason for this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales
Last month, the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago through the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to the containment of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs of online sales alignment, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August showed a minimal increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rate in previous years and will return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, IMRG’s sales index editor.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it comes out on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in the amount of five times more than the average rush to computers to have time to take advantage of the profitable offers, thereby bringing down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound sterling out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashionable stores on the central streets.
Muslims are buried killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and sanctions are imposed on the family of Bin Laden
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims have flown into the streets everywhere to bury 29 of the victims killed in the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the roadway to pay homage to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on parishioners.
The bodies were issued for funerals, and at the same time the King of Saudis fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of the crane in the Main mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised in a broken crane.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-owned agency of the Saudi Press, it is said that the Binladin Group is partially guilty for the collapse.
The British edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the company’s leaders were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the fall of the crane into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked in order to go to the Hajj this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work that Binladin Group conducts.
The bin Laden family has been among the close associates of Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and leads major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor son, whom the family renounced in the 1990’s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174 000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly maimed.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronics Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing

They say that the British are laying in the direction of the hammer and painted brushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to perform work in the house
If you are able to handle a hammer or deftly paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company-owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform simple work around the house.
Veronics Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of homemaking services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specializing in goods for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by women by women.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to ignore the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that the number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past is growing.
Ms. Laurie said: “In our stores still employ mostly men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the purchased goods are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are counted in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managerial team, having achieved an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and the CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Time to make a decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the adoption of a crucial decision within two days - to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who last week believed that the Federal Reserve would go for it, now believe that it will still wait and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from the zero mark and begin the process of normalizing interest rates, ”said Angel Ubide, a leading member of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned markets that it is necessary to prepare for changes, but everything indicates their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees are going to the EU through Croatia.
"Open It!" Hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border are chanting.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has blocked the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered from the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone will cope with this, and even more so such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open a border to refugees who don’t want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not do this, then he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-thilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimaraci: “Europe wants to help us”
Vangelis Meymarakis for a number of years was part of the center-right governments, which, in the opinion of the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he, becoming the interim leader of the New Democracy party, challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimaracis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the Syriza coalition, but now, judging by the polls, the New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so did we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what has been promised with what really happened.
Everyday life became noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this applied to the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where salvation programs have operated or are still operating, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the program by which they reached agreement without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at the current stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you follow this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece on the European path, because it is well represented to what the disastrous consequences would lead the country’s withdrawal from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the fact that lead to a recession can again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their credibility, we must continue to privatize, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed to continue to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the talks, the Tsipras government did not provide any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example related to the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them what your predecessor Antonis Samaras has told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have been promoting reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that suited the Greek government.
I was the speaker of parliament at the time, I managed to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that then constituted a government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we were able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections that were the result of the December presidential election.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should be.
In such matters, you should be ahead of the way, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And now we are in this situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance, the President of the Republic, who called on the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have occurred with them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The corresponding decision should be made at the EU summit, the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing issue.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.

The man who opened the shooting at the University of the State of Delta, left a note with an apology
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning – and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “regret” about the first murder and would like to “return everything back,” the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, reports that a lecturer in geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, “Last night I killed my wife,” and he also mentioned that there was a “drop” in the house that “will not touch anyone,” but probably upset.
The police asked the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found the body there of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, which said, "I'm sorry I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The rector of the University, William Laforge, said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was involved in a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported “there is no information or evidence” of a “love triangle.”
Prentists was referred to as a “good man” by Sean O’Steen, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "inconsistent".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Lindsays, which the newspaper “San Gerald” calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had dated Lamb for about three years.
Noles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called his relatives to say that “he will not go to prison.”
In the evening of the same day, when the police overtook him on the highway "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran away into the forest and there was shot.
According to the summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy at the University of Delta State of University.
Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life partner, Farra Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United out for a few months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost to the PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will not be able to go on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless shaking of Hector Moreno on the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad ride with two legs.
On Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your messages, in words, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more than I was."
Manchester United is experiencing the misfortune with Luke Shaw with the defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the British will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, a PPV coach, said, “It’s a very serious injury.”
When any player is out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him now, because he didn’t have the intention to injure the enemy, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, you feel unwell,” Koku said.
I didn’t have the opportunity to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he touched it, but I didn't see a rolling under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to endure it.
It's hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything about Laurax?
Every parent very quickly learns one thing: if your child liked some book, it will be a little time before you know it by almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company engaged in the organization of children's recreation on vacation, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an ecological bias, written by Dr. Seuz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be well, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the content of the book, but in fact tells the plot of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original narrative.
“In the high-walled city of All-Mulvill, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey – the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire – to see a real tree,” we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Susa (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it looks not suspicious enough, Cameron’s text is read almost as a summary of the plot of the film “Lorax”, posted on the Internet Movie Database website: “In the high walls of the city of All man, man, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey – the girl of his dreams.”
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which a boy named after learns about how the greedy tree cutter and the knitsa “all-nomacles” Nakhodkins, despite the protests of Loraskes (whose name is taken into the book name) – a funny creature with mustaches, which “says on the name of the trees.”
Most likely, such a simple PR-tasm was entrusted to the performer who never read the child’s book about Loraxes 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokeswoman said the text had allegedly been received from Cameron’s office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comment.
For Adam Lit, there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but this is still a difficult question
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the national team that England took for this tour, repeating the defeat in the test series with the score 3-0, which happened last time, does not seem to me likely.
I wouldn’t rule out a win on my own field either.
Aleister Cook’s team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but among the repulsors there are players who masterfully take twisted balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali turns into a bowler serving the torticulated balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Lit dropped out of England test cricket and replaced by Alex Halez
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his head coach in Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that players in cricket are evaluated by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said it before), players choose themselves best.
A pair of half-hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England national team, Trevor Balliss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and this does not surprise me; he is primarily a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression is a difficult question.
Lit played in seven games, as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else’s field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales appears, and he's a batsman, whom I appreciate highly.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at Yorkshire’s club earlier this season when he earned 236 against us on Trent Bridge, that there was already something.
He should be at least given the same opportunity as those before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, keeping four high-speed bowlers, thought about, and I am not at all against it.
I see no reason why a beating player can’t hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for his Woostershire county, but has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches with the “third batsman” before coming out as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a backup spinner, and in my short communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners of the voters "for" a little, and the voters chose youth.
He will learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayoworda, a Sri Lankan bastman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys to play, who will bring to her the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and merciless pace in the setting.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said earlier, can give new strength to the team.
Colley's teammate Durham Ben Stokes is left for one-day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have a problem about this.
Although not everyone will agree with this, the coaches and the players who select the players do not determine the schedule.
And you should remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
UK Reunion Center Could Win If the Economy Is Deployed by 2017
David Cameron’s ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU every day is experiencing more and more difficulties, even without regard for the election of the brilliant Jeremy-“It’s not a yes or no?” – Corbyn is the leader of the Labour leader or TUC’s indignation over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbinas and Nigela Faraggi.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that in the situation in which the EU is now experiencing various crises - not all of them of their own production - some participating countries are fed up on the throat of the British egocentric subpoena of squeezing concessions and undermining the agreements of changes that they mostly do not want.
After going to Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it the Dave and George Selfie program.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are riding on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, taking pictures of themselves against the background of a well-known local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts, Britain under the trunk of the European Union, “Don’t leave us with France,” says Berlin, suggests that the head-in-laws and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they become don’t care, we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation deteriorates for her, how she worsened for Thosecher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France Francois Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing strength, too.
Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may soon receive a leftist one.
It’s hard to see them out of the way to help “selfie-beasts” whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless remares in the style of SNP during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the process of Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The revision was an idea-fix” and “Britamination received nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations.”
Europeans know what kind of predator the Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media moguls are in line with the EU, as opposed to the time of the referendum launched by Tony Benny in 1975, which supported our entry into 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate Euro-opportunist, who became famous for his “direct bananas of the EU” of the Brussels correspondent in the early 90’s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a variable company of tax-fearing crooks, telephone foreign hackers, and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of the same opinion about them, but I was aware that when you were in a cage with a turbulent gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you on lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater adherent of Blair than Blair himself in a confrontation with Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair compromised the principles in favor of the revoked EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me back on Monday on Monday, I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me, it seems that Nil Kinnock’s strategy is “Murdoku’s boycott” from the 80’s – a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press – not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of Ukip’s traditionalist trend and a wider range of “spardoners of England” among the Tories may probably say “yes.”
It’s the same as Hilary-Benn, but not benite-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his inner boycoat was struggling to admit that Corbin’s appointment of the unbearable John McDonnell “shadow” Secretary of the Treasury was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70's, when his old father fought on TV for his disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and losing his post in the cabinet.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not something, McDonnell said, and not that J. K. Spoke to peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to all accounts.
Whatever he wanted to inform the Democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbyn - remember, he touched me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to take for granted the Labour support during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception between McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership – within the framework of the Bennitite economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by a minor distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato, Tom Watson is unshakable in what J.K. will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – to make concessions to Britain, when all this can be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed with the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during a crowd at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
Government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published an important report, a “turning milestone” last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, the “extremely shaky argument” was criticized, on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two more researchers wondered whether these statements were “solid or shaky grounds”.
Martin McKee, a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the University of London, and Simon Capell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health care - the rules must be based on proof of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to generalize their views on harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKee and Capell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director general was reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certifications in the health sector in the Sustainability Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he reportedly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the choice of council members, but among them there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which also announced the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco direction in PHE.
A scientific article published by the group “gively agrees” that there is a lack of “good evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria,” McCley and Capeble wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there’s no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smoking children” were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ had already been answered by BMJ’s statements.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco.”
One of the two smokers died all his life.
All evidence implies that health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what is proved and what this evidence is not proved, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk compared to tobacco.
About 80 000 people a year die from diseases associated with smoking, and smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly pointing out the obvious – that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking – we perform our tasks before the nation.
Former Channel 4 CEO Says BBC Should Stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 CEO Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about “Albert Square”.
Johnson noted that license fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which only a small part of the audience probably watches, at peak airtime, when competitors have a high-rated show, and on such channels as the BBC.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had unsuccessfully tried for six years to work with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t get rid of the thought that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts programs that could be shown by competing non-subsidiaries,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords’ Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s future.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the middle and long term, then the company should keep on the air only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show goes on air in the prime slot, because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else shows it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is the other; it is commonly known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would certainly give a lot to it.
I don’t understand how it can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would have hurt the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings “because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time.”
His comments about the most popular BBC shows echoing the comments of Sky CEO Tony Ball, who in his 2003 lecture in memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered the BBC to sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the more niche transmissions of the BBC of a public nature “continue to go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is completed, and this can be presented as an argument in prudent sermons, justifying income from license fees of 4 billion. Pounds: "Well, yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transmissions that no one watches."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise Rit’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that now only a small part of the materials produced by the BBC are formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should pick up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as “Promenade Concerts” (only a part of them, according to him, is shown on TV), as well as to join in alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows the nematodes changing the direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using slips of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound pulses, too high, so that the human ear can hear them.
Impulses have an effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of the worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were amplified with microscopic bubbles and injected into the bodies of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one that is used in "ophotogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this technique, sonetical may have some benefits.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain on fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass freely through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery you do not need to go inside the skull.
“We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in a clinical setting, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock British Arms Trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Destructing the shining iron shackles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise bats that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
A cheerful voice and painted animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the British government’s intention to “push” weapons repressive regimes by taking advantage of the ExCeL-based exhibition of defense and security systems at the Docklands.
Next Next post: Authoritarian regimes go to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that require to look at them again.
"Is the important announcement going down DLR from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line, turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are drawn by artists who exhibited their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a “set of the placebreaker”, a 6-pound set of wrenches, which is stated to “give access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters of London are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Group "Special Patrol".
According to Gavin Gridon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and a teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to an audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition welcoming passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed more than 100 000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP, working pro bono, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voiceover, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Leaver was struck by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition – with a pass in the ExCel calendar – and thought: “Let’s arrange a campaign that they are trying to avoid.”
They thought to create a more realistic and ingenious corporate advertising, but “to fill her at home with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity.”
“They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our door.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of an arms exhibition is in the inside of ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically epheste products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order on the AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder”, received from the US army.
It includes "unparalleled cumulative warhead, which brings unsurpassed armored action within the target."

Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man, still betting in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the stretched smiles of those I irritated – and numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I have learned can be put apart according to eight simple rules.
Moving to the dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He encourages talking: to tell people where you come from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you “honestly, neither love nor hate Martin, because, seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract of HAKHAH, I will be at my own time.”
Take a break.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It keeps the conversation and helps you find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn’t even talk, even if your eyelashes were caught up, and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas and places of common party, but they are also the place where people dress and correct underwear.
Don’t even think about starting your university while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of vacillation from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, communication and leads to long friendly relations.
This may be hell for someone who tries to regain strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent on communicating with you.”
Try to feel when the classmate is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Bring friends with baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies - not such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950's with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I'm baked to you, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Proposing home treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel that they have to chat with you, and in the end, probably your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good bakery you are.
Poorly-litold bunches of flour, sugar and fat will rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the assignment of someone's chicken - theft, but is it theft - to take a little milk for tea?
Cope with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will ask you not to be ashamed, even if it boils from rage inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry - but try to treat this older than my neighbor, who poured utter dishes in her milk to take revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You don’t have to make a trunchion that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to turn the sound of a drum and bass guitar, as it was 3 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 in the morning, she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then broke his music and locked the door behind her, going on a three-hour exam.
Wasn’t it romantic if your future husband settled in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extremely, before the biting of the elbows, clumsily, if you took the neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away by him, tore off the relationship and would have to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull to his side all your mutual friends?
Of course, you can not order the heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own ardor slightly.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the prank and the persecution is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson, hiding something - but never a pack of someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Sit down someone else's door and lower the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not stick someone else's things with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, select General and then by Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some faced problems after installation when an error message appears, telling them that “Update of the application failed.”
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revitalization subsides, or try to upgrade through iTunes.
Tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing applications to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the update size, and also made it easier to perform with a special utility that offers to uninstall applications and re-installed them after the process is completed.
Make sure that when you update, your phone is charged or next to the charger to prevent the battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update as the phone discharge in the process can lead to a downgrade.
iOS 9 goes out according to the plan, despite the delay of WatchOS iOS 9: the least impressive and the best update of iOS 9: how to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone
You should make sure that you’ve seen our checklist of the actions that you need to take before downloading to try and get something to stop going wrong, and protect yourself from something if it’s something gone wrong. The iOS 9 now includes new features, including an advanced personal assistant, and innovations that improve iPad performance, as well as settings that increase speed and fix the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad leads only to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that further support for President Assad by Russia poses a risk of aggravation and prolongation of the conflict, and also has a negative impact on our common goal – the fight against extremism – if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by directly transferring power,” the State Department said in a statement.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to the fight against the “Islamic state” within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be happy with the constructive role of Russia in attempts to oppose the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokeswoman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: “When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime “losing bet”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
“But he didn’t listen to my warnings – and as a result, the situation has worsened,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by the assistant Minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, following the results of a trip to the Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the FCS, Rosturizm - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storing, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about € 200 million annually go to the treasury of European countries for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with a Full Conditional Exemption from Payment of Customs Duties”, which provides for the provision of a full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this, of course, will contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, ”said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted to the subcommission on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, the meeting of which took place in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of economic development, the proposed measure for full conditional release during importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. Among them are service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation and measuring equipment, drilling equipment, stage costumes and scenery, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious rites.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they prepared mandatory resolutions on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the call and exit of small-dimensional, sports sailing and pleasure vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the sea ports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sports sailing and pleasure craftsmen into the seaport and the exit of listed ships from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport has prepared draft orders of the government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the seaports of Crimea.
In relation to Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of coordination, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there it is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, virtually everything stands still.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area there are very strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permissions.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht has nowhere to refuel.
For two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it, - says the sales director of the company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, the yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a loan of $ 500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
The World Bank’s director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Qismayo Fan, said that the banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank are watching the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the granting of a loan of € 100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transgender people in colonies.
About this “Izvestia” said a member of the Council Vladislav Grib.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who are not determined by the floor, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks, or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens to serve in such isolated places only after the convicts pass the appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is really a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) provide for separate chambers for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today it is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
Definitely they need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, this is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of trances on the part of cellmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with an indefinite sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Separate pre-trial detention is definitely not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Gryb explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transgender prisoners will be able to go to serve sentences there from any regions.
Citizens are detained in a pre-trial detention center at the place of commission of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for already convicts in a separate colony - yes, "Mushroom believes.
Recall that on the eve of law enforcement officers could not decide which detention center - male or female - to determine the detained for drug possession of 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known under the name Alina Davis), because of which a man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a recognizance of not leaving.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, since there is really no mechanism for the content of transgender people in the pre-trial detention facility and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places to serve the punishment for transgender, noting that abroad it is also possible to determine people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the question of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done for homosexuals, especially since there are more transgender people in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that in Russia there will be many citizens who are ready to pass themselves off as transexuals in order to get into a different colony from the usual colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before placing people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything happens unequivocally.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning’s prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison he said that he wanted to change gender, ”said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will seriously think about the safety of such people and learn about the intricacies of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony can strongly postpone the beginning of serving the sentence of convicts.
A commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry capabilities allow this.
Therefore, before changing the floor, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they accurately show whether the sex change with surgery is the necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system to the convicts, because on average it takes a month for such a survey.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that there are about 5% homosexuals in Russia, then we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are a small number at all.
Now, at the request to the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can already receive certain conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Junior Chess Championship up to 20 years has ended.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Dudu, who seemed to confidently go to the title.
The girls were won by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buks.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Chistef Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was the rating-favorite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the gap was very insignificant.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in round 13.
But even that wouldn’t help, win Dud’s game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda to finish his party, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a draw against the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.

Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not become an analogue of the card system for the distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food aid to the population and supporting an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card".
I would like to emphasize that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product cards with an echo of past times of total deficit, the distribution card system, in which the number of products obtained is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation,” Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was submitted to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
Being a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of the rating of the last year.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the rating of the current year and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the original list is offered to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the functional areas of the company: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Director of HR, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new executives from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on an industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to log in to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the remaining participants and can make their ratings on the criteria offered for each functional direction.
The basis of the rating construction methodology is the principle of "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All interested candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of senior leaders and eight commissions for the approval of heads of functional areas.

The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do this: bets are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The level of rates of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive profitability on them.
How much do you assess the demand of entrepreneurs for loans are satisfied with?
After the CB drop in the interest rate, the situation has improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one way out: you need to learn how to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, control the movement of funds.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow you to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of the SME lending market will strengthen and will influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes an increased interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with the reduction of the rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delay, then traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishing funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillice or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, as, however, any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive from the outside, is technically perfected inside.

There is nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only the technique, but all other Japanese.
To Quote on the move of Base, seasoning with food wasabi, collecting katana and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: sweet, creatively and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl is, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille with five horizontal lines.
But the appearance of the car changes the appearance of the car a new pattern of headlights and rear lanterns, through which the car instantly recognizes in the flow of cars.

The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but appearance has a plaque of rig.
The police will not have to call.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese tranquility.
A 2.2-LD diesel engine provides high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 liters. p. - only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, in Mazda made every effort to make sure that behind the wheel of the CX-5 you did not find yourself in the place of your own accident.
To further increase comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension reworked the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, and also optimized the shape of the bushings of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted for Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The swimsuit in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's another matter if the girl flaunts herself in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
Attention then will go no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space for both the wide shoulders and for long legs - who has what.
Long-legged will certainly appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat the ankles in the turns.
The widest set of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is adaptive lighting, and a warning about derailment from the lane, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, having a minimum of protrusions, it can accommodate a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a proportion of 4:2:4 - at the same time, each section is equipped with a separate pulling lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the hero of the cartoon in Japan is called “kigurumi”.
Especially cheerful looks kigurumi-pyjama.
You can do anything in it!
Too sleep, of course.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just walk such an animal on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - cool clothes, a manner of behavior or a car.

Kiev broke the nuclear union.
Kiev officially issued the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that terminates the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth unit at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The bill submitted by the government of the country was carried out only from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the project.
The Khmelnytsky NPP laid under the USSR under the original project was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER reactors, but only two managed to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, in 2011-2012 the Verkhovna Rada adopted relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that it would be necessary to build blocks on the loan of the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the project for the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have remained, there was still the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the generation of electricity in the country), since while the Ukrainian NNEGC "Energoatom" has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
From the plans to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet finally refused: back in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

So far, there are no such plans.
“But anything can happen,” said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov said about the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is planned for a certain meeting this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “to return to the normal functioning of our countries.”
When asked whether, in his opinion, there is currently a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election Commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the city Duma elections in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were made by representatives of the Communist party, who accused the election commission of “covering falsifications”.
The opposition’s remarks were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission refused the party “Communists of Russia” in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections to the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were issued ballot papers in the polling stations, and 268 thousand voted in the elections. Voters.
More than 11.7 thousand were declared invalid. Bulletins, and 24 - Lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on their votes.
On the lists of United Russia, six deputy seats in the city Duma rely on Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of “Fair Russia” go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he will move to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the city election Commission Alexander Makeev told the members of the Commission that he was on duty for “sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others” for the refusal of mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the CPRF announced multiple violations.
A member of the city election commission with the right of deliberative vote from the Communist Party Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building was closed, where four district commissions were located.
For a long time, neither deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could pass inside, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend.
The head of the head stopped access only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions have not yet come to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election commission.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the legislative assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristova, about which the statement was sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition also resented that in a number of PECs on election day began to seal the urns at 6-7 a.m., posting ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right of deliberative vote and observers, so they came by the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of polling stations in the ballot boxes could uncontrollably throw the ballots.
However, the electoral Commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with stuffing unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of his colleague from “Fair Russia” Maria Popova through the regional election commission to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the urn.
“In the order of your own initiative, please contact the CEC,” advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman with high-profile accusations was attacked by a member of the Communist Party Sergei Samokhin, shouting that the election commission ignores dozens of complaints and covers falsifications in the elections.
"You're not here at a rally, be careful to say!" - offended the chairman of the election commission.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the electoral Commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party “Communists of Russia” to register an initiative group for the local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to submit to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod two questions: do they agree that fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be “immediately canceled”, and tariffs for housing and communal services “freeze until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the law.
FedEx revenue is mixed, a decline in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the shipping service giant reduced the forecast for annual profits due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its division of land transportation.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx announced last year that it would hire 50 000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 percent in preliminary auction 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. Said he plans to earn $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite the increase in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on January 4, and an increase in fees for ground transportation of heavy or overall cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans revenue growth from last year by cutting costs, rising gross revenue and rising online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "worked stably taking into account weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade."
Plans to hire labor during the holidays were announced the day after the competitor’s statement, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95 000 employees, about the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $ 2.42, close to the forecast of an average of 2.44 dollars per share conducted by Zacks Investment Research by a survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to 12.3 billion. dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected 12.23 billion. dollars.
FedEx has suffered a decline in the international transport sector in recent years, leading to a lack of growth in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online purchases dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transportation unit has received higher returns due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector the income fell due to higher labor costs.
At preliminary auctions, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent over the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of Honduran mahogany wood, deciding whether it is not time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a richly decorated meeting room with a height of two floors above them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The central bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten instruction: financial stability.
And that third order could prove to be an unknown factor in an almost forecasted decision on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unpriencious stimulus provided by the nearly zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, recent upheavals in global financial markets can keep already cautious executives of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject to consideration,” Lindsey told M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the Brokerage Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow by the promise that the next increase will not soon be.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the Federal System’s strategy would reliance this week,” said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“There will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the Federal Reserve’s management does, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that the rate hike could reassure financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal system seemed to be leaning to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labor market was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and at almost the level that the Federal System considers full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Federal system management said the key was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the reduction in the labor market,” said Ian Sheferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones stock index for industrial stocks fell by as much as 16% relative to a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow down global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market indignation further complicates the difficult calculations of the period of interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been twisting the screws at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oiner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences for the American economy can be, and they have almost no reliable data after the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not within the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a global financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
A hint from the then Chairman Ben C. Bernanke in 2013. The Federal Reserve could “mouth” its monetary expansion has caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, it would be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “rather an art than science,” said Zachari Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “the history of the Federal Reserve had been experiencing excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles.”
Lacker, a member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despicting on the limited identifiable consequences for U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the Federal system canceled these downs.
The Federal Reserve should put the care to take stability first only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” Adam S said. Pense, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The last panic and did not come close to this level, he said.
“You would, of course, not want to be in a situation where you are frightened by rising rates due to the fact that markets are experiencing a shock,” said Posen, president of the Institute of World Economy. Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of events.

State Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees flood into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar within the framework of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is, is it Europe that is not the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal perseverance, has destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?” - he asked.
“For sure, someone imagined and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who flee from death will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Is many political leaders in Europe frankly spoke about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally overwhelming their countries?”
“No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked and looks at how the military boot, sewn according to NATO standards, is being trampled by the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker stressed.
Government troops and paramilitary groups loyal to them are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. supports the rebels who confront both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the West’s dislike of Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin urged the international community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if it leaves - then at the request of the people, and not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want them to stay, the president stays, and otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about Iran’s military support, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were heading to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
“Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic state”, banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is launching air strikes on ISIS positions.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper slandered on Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of “Tape.ru”.
The note in the Washington Post is beautiful because everything is completely reversed there.
Former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and “was” from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very high mood, without ropes, without three trucks of money, which are attributed to him by different characters,” he said.
According to Borodai, it was really about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia by the “connected”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then this is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Strelkov left himself, ”said Borodai.
“It’s a slander against me and Strelkov,” he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post there was an article in which the words of Beauth that he took Strelkov to the territory of Russia in force.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to associate his colleague.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers began to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clean the forest in order to check the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolars, suggested that new evidence of the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Polish Deputy Minister of Culture, Petr Zukhovsky, said that local treasure hunters with a “99 percent probability” found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is referred to in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbjih with a message that they had found a train in a sworn tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until 21 years.
Eugene Brun noted that up to this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said live radio station “Moscow speaking”, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years old.
The man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
“Importedly from the scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry finally matures only by the age of 21,” said Brune.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project “Sober Russia” Sultan Khamzayev told “Izvestia” that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and “agic together with the Public chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development", the statement on September 16 was familiarized with the report of Sib.fm.
The author of the appeal said that on August 26, 2015 he purchased in the store "Received" on Krasny Prospekt the Bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law “On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development”.
On September 16, the statement was adopted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will arrive within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, this is quite a thorough problem that will shake the society.
It will also begin to re-read the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grandi Promotes Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for adequate nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves a demonstration of images of babies plucking breasts painted with images of junk food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs, pregnant and women who give birth are recommended to increase the daily rate of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should do.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system was revealed.
Near Hamburg, the train rambed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, they had a clash in front of them.
He was shot by one of the students.
Because of the emergency situation among the students there was a panic.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, miraculously no one was injured, except for one passenger of the train, who received light injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for the ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for banning boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life support apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children.
This is the second case of death among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braidon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but better, from her point of view, to ban it altogether.
“I understand that this is unintentional,” said Vice President Stephen Parnis. -
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when the athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that unites practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The speaker of the state Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called unacceptable the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We see this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's take morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us bring humanistic ideals back to the democratic world order.
“The twinkling never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that we must pay tribute to the OSCE.
“This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOV.
He managed at his crown distance 110 meters with barriers to win at the team championship of Europe, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, finishing third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in Korea, and then I will think about vacation.
However, I will now prepare at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It’s easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is a favorite time of year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season bogged down, the burden of responsibility no longer presses.
You can compete for pleasure, on "relaxation".
Plus, you know that the vacation is very soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn’t matter what I did more – he won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, relocations - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
What's there - I'm just happy!
By the time they finished at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's coming.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the athlete who lives old victories is bad, scrolls through his successful races again and again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can’t say there was anything so special.
We started preparing back in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
It's all as usual.
But the coach was tasked with: to try to reach a new level that I was not yet at.
Almost all winter time was spent on laying the base.
We ran a lot of crosses, did the exercises on general physical training, which included cravings, and stool, and we pumped our back.
Then they began to prepare for barrier training, studied a lot of equipment.
How did the rivals follow?
I always try to do this, the good in the age of the Internet there is no problem with this.
Watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint, the entire pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought more: you need to do something, to dilute this company.
With each start this season you added and added results.
Did that give confidence?
I have been developing in much the same way over the past seasons.
There is no such thing that I run first 13:20, and then 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is to run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and at competitions it is not always possible to show your readiness.
What was it like at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubekov could not qualify for the final. - "NI") tried to forget right away.
It was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if I repeated his best result at that time, would be the bronze medalist of the Games.
But it's unlucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about that?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the final then, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right from the country, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and rushing headlong is not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later at the World Cup in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the “gold”!
How does it work, developing decent speed, not to lose your head, not to turn off?
This is the most difficult thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to pour barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but for the process, it is so much easier.
And the highest, when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to work on its own!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the outback after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
It may be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov?
Since the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
More precisely, at first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she gave me.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's all-around was - this is when the ball is throwing, jumping in length from the place ...
At 14 I tried the hurdles, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
It stayed.
Have there ever been any fear of barriers?
I immediately agreed with them.
But there was always a lot of work on technology.
There was so much anxious over one time!
But there's no escape from this routine.
The equipment needs to be honed constantly - so that at night I could be awakened, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my races, and I couldn't resist here.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency - there are no limits to perfection.
Aren’t you afraid that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders of a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once I chose this road, then it has to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any additional burden.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not so naive that I was surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, their bread does not fed - give, throw the enemy.
And although I did not wave the flag, and the same, just the same, a million times said here, and did not directly call anyone with a bastard, - another touched me.
All my pseudo-friends in a moment, evaporated somewhere.
The pressure I am being subjected to is so strong that even I, who saw the species of boys, I think people are white.
As if he was walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd and mutto rods.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'll give a toss out of the howitzer, I'm old, I'm guys afraid.
Another thing is no support.
I had no illusions, but now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite.
And only assholes can give passports like Fred Durst or Monson.
I better, the best journalist, have a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili in sharp form described the Crimean events:
What was done with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to the drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something, does not fit into the general picture of the human hostel.
It's like coming to a neighbor and picking his living space...
The war from the Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with a call of some bastard from the Kremlin’s dungeon.
I have the assumption that could have been...
There is not much left to live in cobzone.
I don’t understand, he’s the greatest artist, why should he lick Putin’s hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
Well, the monument was demolished.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland.
And reconciliation is now only dependent on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh Leads in the Rating Despite Ninth’s Eve Leaders’ Loss in Today Show
The treasury of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinoson in Canberra to cover the consequences of the statement of the Liberal party about the release of the place of the leader could not strongly raise the rating of Today.
The morning show of the Ninth aired from the capital of the state after Malcolm’s defeat by Turn Bull to Tony Abbott.
The competitor - Sunrise - with the leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture of distance, it seems, did not matter much for Australian viewers, despite the fact that the Sunrise audience numbered 397 000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the audience of Today in 339 000.
Today gained a little more than its rating on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318 000 compared to 330 000 from Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged from 40 000 and 50 000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349 000 spectators against 314 000 from Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's been going on all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for clarifying!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have reasoned whether Thomson can handle the popular show alone, without the star of Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh, the success and failure of the second evening of Chase Australia mingled.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz, which was conducted by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446 000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623 000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour Chase Australia gathered 520 000 spectators, and the second half hour - overwhelming 720 000.
Hot Seat has collected 620 000.
The fall in the ratings of Chase Australia on the second evening will force the Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute that failed to beat McGuire.
It was originally published as "Sunrise leads, while Today remains at the local level"
Three finalists are unanimous in the fact that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezana Marcoska may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win in The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in the Bachelor's is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And three surviving girls, of course, keep silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snezhnaya Marcoska and Lane Jones-Fellowes on the eve of the day when the three girls had to stay two, they may have an accidental about the winner.
Sam Wood steadfastly remains silent until Thursday's finale
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, dedication, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with the answers to the question "If you are not, then who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell which of them actually won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellos and Marcoschi unquestioningly called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
A good relationship has been established between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
“From the moment I was a member of the participants, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and I understood that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show did not doubt it,” said Jevonce-Fellowes.
“Sara is a very open person, it is easy and fun with it,” Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there really was a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
Mackey herself said that thanks to homework last week, she realized that Wood may be the “the same person”.
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game – I believed him with all my heart,” she says.
When asked who to choose Voodoo, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snezhan and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show comes out on Wednesdays at 19.30 on the Stone Channel.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle became interested in him after moving to the United States - as well as many other clubs who sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian rugbi allowed at the first return of the pant in the winning game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayna another opportunity to regain the pant, and also used him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself from the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of making a reversal to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter of the 49ers club Cam Inman said that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of special teams Thomas McGoot, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball at the return of the pant by the Mineness Vaikings team during the first quarter
On such a start to debut in the NHL Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
It was clear how Hayne swears, leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the host of the show “Hamish and Andy” at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
“That happens, you’re just thinking about the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his vac to debut in the series of Origin games in 2007, when the throw of the ball in his standing zone brought the attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.

On the border of Hungary there were clashes of migrants with the police.
Refugees staged protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian village of Reske, which turned into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw the police with stones and trying to demolish the fence installed at the border.
Reinforcements have been sent to the scene of the clashes, police are taking action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to disrupt the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities allowed migrants to arrive at the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the right country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened migration and border protection legislation.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for considering asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which it will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the transfer to the armed forces of Hungary the functions of border protection of the country’s parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire border 175 km long on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to the commission of the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
Accused of the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the New Jersey Federal Court, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about the collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Administrators like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, perhaps, will reduce his term.
The verdict to Drinkman will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect Dmitry Smilyanets was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes incriminated to him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of Russia’s regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that support for Russian Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal to combat extremism if we don’t focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
Kerry reaffirmed the US commitment to the fight against the group “Islamic state” (whose activities are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “will never be able to be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during a telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only by political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation over support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the press Secretary of the White house Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation, if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Syria.
To which the head of the Russian foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and help the Syrians to develop equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal as police began firing rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the country’s new constitution, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandai, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1 000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal said police used tear gas, then shot in the air before flowing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative have caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, low-priced Nepal, where Mazei people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter will be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70-ies of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of “Regional”.
Oleg Valerievich, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activity, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of the local budget.
Then the municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of document circulation to five days.
Previously, the papers on the instances could have been going on for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting session of the government was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no design and estimate documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the roads, kindergarten, the northern sewer and the water conduit.
Road works are already underway in two areas.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics in the city have not been observed for the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most relevant.
From September 1, closed for major repairs of kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the repair, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, the program "People's Initiatives" also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children aged one and a half to three years.
We have no queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, by Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is commissioned.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand. Q. There are a lot of people who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand. rubles for one square meter, this cost includes finish "turnkey".
If we cope with the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this transaction.
Moreover, the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Social Partnership Institute developed in Sayansk?
We have about 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, LLC "Sayansky broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city of OOO "Sayansky broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" repaired the equestrian yard, where specialists are engaged in hips with children, spending more than 1 million rubles on it.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to celebrate the City Day.
As in the good old days there was a parade with the participation of city teams and organizations.
The chronicle of the city, a book by Sayan poets, was published.
First builders and people who have made a serious work contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded jubilee medals.
The patrons also participate in the city charity fund.
The very first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months more than 800 thousand. rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, support for children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There are not enough doctors and teachers in the city.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance for the provision of housing specialists.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a program to allocate housing with the ability to privatize it in five years.
The plans include redevelopment of the building in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that there is a workable team in the city, with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is made annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law, submitted to the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.

Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a doubling campaign for $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugees that are fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has used an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the executives, an employee of Google Rita Massoud, who ran with his family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, were hungry, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, a lot of people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations involved in aid to refugees and migrants: “Doctors Without Borders”, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first 5.5 million. Donation dollars until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million. dollars.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II, triggered for the most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has moved more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with minor obesity can help obesity surgery
A favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with minor obesity suffering from type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with minor obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics are not immediately manifested,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery expert who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Sundery editor’s column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI 25 or higher suggests that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1DzqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Shen General hospital used data collected since 2007, comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy, with a medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with minor obesity.
The average BMI value in those undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their involvement in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% of diabetes were completely cured of diabetes, and partly - 28%.
In the group that received medical treatment, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed in only 1%, and partially - only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “generally were better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin levels that reflected blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected by good hemoglobin levels A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate over the five years, according to the research chief Dr. Chi-Cheng-Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the two-type medical results.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that received the sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there are evidences from the study of people who are overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine in g. Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who have chosen bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to a group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study has not shown an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with an IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report here is very important because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low-Bam group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient’s BMI gets into the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out of the house fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow region house and stole them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by “Interfax” with reference to the press service of the Ministry of internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons through the open entrance door entered the house, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article “Robbery”.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not in a hurry to obtain the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to come up with how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of Rosbalt believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically under the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must go through the classification procedure and prove what corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the FAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases in relation to hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the antimonopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens, placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now literally every number is on account, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand. Numbers.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two-star and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy committee for tourism development of Nana Gvichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have been classified - so many inspections were conducted by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, by an amazing coincidence, is unknown.
That is, there may be more than those who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
“For the past six months, hotels were not very eager to pass the classification,” admitted Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-Western Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets that did not include the costs of inspections, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand. rubles and more.
But still, recently, hotel leaders have intensified and began to apply for a classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels need to have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not also receive the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the stardom will be developed a fixed room for the hotel for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to prevent the rise in prices by 200-300%, as is happening, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow a promotion two to three times, but hotels need to be given to earn.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” said Gennady Lamshin, president of the Russian Hotel Association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than a reckless rise in price,” he said.
It’s unclear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the state Duma introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that the hostels should be preserved,” Nana Gvachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close about 80% of hostels, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand in them. Numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there are not enough two- and three-star hotels, which are just in demand by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when "75 thousand VIPs are sitting at the 80-thousandth stadium."
This can be corrected just about mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers “idiocy”: “It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can not.”
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if it's like a hotel to which guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup and because of their slowness.
Entire hundreds of small hotels simply will not have time to pass the classification, and the pit is dropped for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive,” said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the checks passed at the moment are significantly higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is associated, among other things, with constant reshuffles in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to well-coordinated work.
According to experts, if the St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, which most likely will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300 anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized in the city, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive in a prepared race on vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
“The main thing is not to adjust so many hotels that they are empty later,” Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will be used rental housing.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
“Of the obvious – the first will go housing near the stadium”, – said Larisa Bragina, a researcher for the development and research Agency.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not just suggest a way, but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are also complications.
My father in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult with hotels then, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
“And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the residents of the city - it is fraught with consequences and scary to call to your home.
But maybe in 2018 after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "leaked" the Amur region.
With admiration today I looked at the clown of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The topic of the speech, it seems, is “the LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols are not shaking - because there is nothing; there are no other protocols other than those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR, apparently.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: “Here is the winner of the election!”
And then, then, after a skirmish with the presiding, brings the faction out of the meeting room, literally "you are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, gives an emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insults.
Really, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly leaked the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another antics of Zhirinovsky in the style of “Scumbags!”, and not a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the party’s website and Facebook, Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
Provides the dead on the Umura to bury their dead, and he himself speaks against United Russia as a whole and incorruptible Rodnina.
An elegant decision, so that the face is not to lose, and in a real, not a ostentatious scandal, not to go.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself finds himself in a strange position.
In addition to the cries from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it was he who became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks on the EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think very much about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 policy of the region and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate constituency, he can turn into a pariae who was successfully used by its own party leadership and super-irritator for the very ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
For sure - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should be invented and respectfully monitored.
Trump is still growing and growing before him.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.
The bath fell from nothing at all.
The only thing, Abramov buried the theme.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to the violence in countries that are the birthplace of refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched upon the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion at Oxford on Ethical Research at the beginning of its 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term decisions on how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US tough reaction launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this caused unexpected consequences,” said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand disinfectant over the past 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Cancer Center, cases of ingestion by children under 12 years of body of hand disinfection, which were reported to toxicology centers, increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percent of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or a social media debate.
In the videos on Youtube you can see how teenagers drink disinfectant as a cheap drink.
It is reported that the teenagers mixed the disinfectant with the alcohol-containing mouth rinse to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may attract pleasant odors of disinfectant fluid.
“The child doesn’t think it can hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand liquids) are those that are flavored.
There are disinfectant hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant liquid for the hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s high-concentration alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just leave a glass of whisky, but people keep these disinfectants for the hands, and if the children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand disinfectant with a strawberry fragrance in the amount of about four sprays at school, was sent for treatment to the ambulance department.
She had 179 blood alcohol levels, twice as much as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnet medical center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance station.
Doctors observed her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of a brain injury, because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, said Ritchie.
“It was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Naiji’s mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcohol substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition, to remove disinfectants for hands from the child's reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-grader students in northern New York conspired to poison their “anti-NAtentian” teacher by “spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she forbade keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty conversations”, and addresses the issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library.  Krupskaya is sad for a cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her with candy.
For several generations, he has been in this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances on Mayakovsky’s poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with the wife of Lenin.
Correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her children's photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnaul residents asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library to be given her name, she wrote that no, does not mind.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile is decorated with a bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, resented: why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political color!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path made of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and from all the other managers was distinguished only by a love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "I need an illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mother has cancer."
Olga did illustrations, and thought: life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and herself composes fairy tales.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they increasingly live in some virtual space.
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - says "Russian Planet" director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we even have such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids come here!
I think interest in reading is back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library rejoices that dads are increasingly coming to children.
If at the age of two the child was read only Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more difficult.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category of 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring their parents with them - they come, then they come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics and veins, the story of Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the moulder "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not a school, "explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a playground for kids - the child just comes to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they rest with their legs, do not want to leave.
Often mothers come with wheelchairs - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: modern children, as well as we once, love classical children's literature:
“Publishing is now developing, and much attention is paid to the authors, who are the connecting link between generations.”
And if we talk about young children, then it is important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly releases booklets for parents, in which it tells what happens in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden to bring books outside the reading room by adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the book depository.
The steps will be crippled under your steps - this is already a very old time machine.
You meet with the book of your childhood, as with an old comrade: hello, it is good that you and I do not change.
Ellie still walks fun along the road paved with yellow brick, the lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Boybalchish never said to the Dawn bourgeois of the Military Mystery - such a firm word.
Books like passwords like passwords can be found out anywhere.
There are real books in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics and heroes.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous application to the magazine "Niva".
Or the Murzilka file for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea.
These publications are no longer given to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream everything - I will retire and deal with rare children's books.
But children are already, so to speak, will not be guided: and the colors in the old books are not very bright, and themes ... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer's Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - says "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository.
The pages of "Murzilki" darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running a book depository all her life.
She knows what color the hollow of Buratino, in what academic year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for the motor, and who works the father of Alice Selezneva.
Little is paid for the work of the librarian, and everyone who can live without these book series, very quickly find a different profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at the first minute of the conversation, he is a professional.
I generally love children's books: as a librarian, I like to be, to stand flatly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me.
And since I loved them insanely, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope there will always be books despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren ...
The rumor of the rumor: in the “Celtic” there is no disagreement
Griffiths denied talk of disagreements in Celtic after Dale's admission that Hups is in a bad situation, but he'll fix it.
The Harts will protest against the claim of the Scottish Football Association to Nyllson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January, which can violate the unity of the team
“Dons” increased the advantage over “Celtic” to five points
The penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half gave “Aberdeen” a slight advantage over “Hamilton” in Pittodry, which allowed “Dons” to break away from “Celtic” by five points.
Griffiths denied talk of disagreements
This caused rumors of disagreements in Celtic, which were stopped by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we feel tension, I think the players are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because there are no Scots in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former member of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he does not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive moments of the Celtic games are no longer shown, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
In the games of the "Old Firm" a lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
“I’ll change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
The defeat against Malmo and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss to 10 players of Aberdeen, who now, having withdrawn by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Della said: “The Seliktka had bad periods before, and we will go out again.”
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset by what is happening.
And we too, but we have to continue.
And we really really need the support of Celtic because players are getting much better from that.
Staying together is so important now.
Warberton is distrustful waiting for January transfers
Despite the opinions that appeared just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers’ boss Mark Warburton distrusts the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford striker said: “Janwara’s transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is caused by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans is over.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
“Harts” are going to confront the SFA about Neilson’s statements
The Harts were wived 2:1, when Paters was removed, and 3:2, but the defender’s red card was later canceled; this is the third red card of Collum, canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up his words, claiming: “I didn’t question ethics, I didn’t comment on the game.”
Griffiths vowed to avoid Taynaksl
A stubborn player of the Heibern team was reproached after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive words about the former Harts player Rudy Scocel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tymarksall in March 2014.
“It was a derby, and it was hot,” the attacker said, adding, “I can say with confidence that I wasn’t going to go back to Tynaskall if he wasn’t playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: the council of Tannadis is confident in the management of “Dandy United”
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dundee United is still confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys out again,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad that “ugly” won against “Hamilton”
Derek McKinness admitted that his team “Aberdeen” had to fight against “Hamilton Assis” in order to achieve the seventh victory in a row in the championship of the league, which put them five points above the “Celtic”, at the top of the standings, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInness said: “There’s no team here that won something – the cup, or the league championship, who didn’t win the meeting in this way.”
Unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
The UNEMPLOYMENT IN Scotland remained at 164 000 people between May and July, while the number of non-working in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million. during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people in three months, while the number of workers is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by quarter to 74.0%, above the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Minister of Scotland David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labor market with rising employment and reducing unemployment.
Why I am a witness to execution in Oklahoma
Today, evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a person execute.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit at the death row in Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time this request was made back in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When I came near this day, I became afraid.
So why do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of seats for the press was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we had our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting that I would be committed by my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she herself “could better formulate”, but still believes that I am wrong about what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he was talking.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Beller, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the subccounts I have recorded.
I won't go into details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip isn't to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treise make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can’t say I’d be objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can ask for it.
You will learn from me what it’s like to watch as a person I like dies unnecessarily.
Persecuted by the police man was persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The constable from the town of Canning-Weil managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and to remain dry himself.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but could not get stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to “gently persuade him to go ashore.”
The Cunning-Vale police were summoned on Tuesday after illegally entering someone else’s territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not going out, come on, grab me,’” Sergeant Sandall Castledine said.
Constable Laklan Perhavets did not really want to wet the form, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good policeman."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says senior Sergeant Castlein.
Football champion Ben Cousins is exactly what I remember.
In 2006, Cousins moved into a deswage to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim from Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but encouraged local residents to invent a comic “Bina Casigns’ biathlon”.
Peter Moody accuses stewards of trying to espionage and threatening to leave equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt to introduce the spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
His target was the stewards and ethics staff of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of orchestrating a campaign personally against him, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort in racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, which he can’t explain.
He kept his mouth for suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to talk about it, and I’ve endured for a long time, but sometimes it’s so knocked you out of the rut that you can’t restrain yourself anymore,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and sleep tightly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know - I do my best for them.
When they start to think it’s not the case, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a year and a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man I’d call it if asked, and offered him a job at my stable to pass on information about what I’m doing in my canal,” Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they all undoubtedly should submit applications, since they did not manage to try to catch me.
Robert Rolston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and know now.
Shouldn’t that make me think it’s getting a personal matter?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to find out and hold accountable for what is happening in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to get my license and push me out, and I have no doubt - what I'm saying now, can make them think about it.
But I've reached the point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and will blame them for making a decision.
I have the support from the family, and I can leave.
The annoyance of the coach only grew during a long investigation of the case of cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could “shove his license to the table”.
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition “ridiculous” after a compress of clay was applied to the horse’s feet, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules on the jumps.
“I have to be fully responsible for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made her a compress on her foot.
She could have got a compress last night.
She could have got him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, about which the stewards opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it has gone too far,” Moudi said.
The driver who hit and fled from the scene in Cobram, was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepepton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the scene, non-assistance and violation of other traffic rules.
Motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in a stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy retorts rivals accusations of tough power tricks
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the ball intercepting his team as “imposing the agenda” from the two favorites of the NRL championship.
The coach of “Sydney Rusters” Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed “Storm” to “fight” with his team during the sudden victory of “Storm” in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brasbain Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a reversible hint at Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament from the Xwarson Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called the game “typical” for the Roughbe League and stated that two of the Queensland team were not “too successful” in the hand.
Bellamy defended his team’s interception of the ball and said they were just focused on “contact” intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was instilled in the confidence of his team by two leading coaches, as this means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
“It keeps popping up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about hard receptions when they beat us with a score of 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch for us that we haven’t changed anything in our systems or defense techniques, just over the past six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he is clearly coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and it was some shock for him.
It’s funny, as it always manifests itself at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett’s idea of “impressive football”, reminding his teacher that Bennett’s St. George-Ellavard Dragons won the championship in 2010, showing “boring” football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and see how impressive their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010. St. George was criticized a lot, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
It’s a football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style — not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things as they are a little worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Russians" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and that's the impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
This is routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm won’t be right to host either North Queensland Caubouboys or Cronall Sharks next Saturday night at the AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
The accused in the possession of drugs Serb released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
A man who faces life imprisonment for trying to appropriate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland with smuggling was released on bail of 200 000 dollars.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht coming from South America through Vanuatu and moored in Coumerian in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met with them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for trying to assign narcotic substances in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich’s lawyer claims that there was no evidence that the latter tried to get the entire party, and that the man could be in a cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about the location of his place.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovich was asked to make a joint pledge of $ 200 000 for his release.
“Of the testimony of both, it becomes obvious that the amount of bailout of 200 000 dollars is too much a financial burden for them,” said Judge Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he will hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, will be celebrated in the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: “I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds”
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match of the 1/4 finals of the Eurobasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was solved by some mistakes.
It was a big game, Katsikaris quotes AFP.
We were preparing for a great game performed by the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: “CSKA will be entrusted with Kauna’s functions in me”
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
“I’ve spoken to coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team,” R-Sport quotes Freeland. In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive structures and in an attack from a three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yes, I will need some time to rebuild the center position, after all, I played a forward in the NBA.
Now we will need to confront the big center rival more, but I’ve done it before, so I think I’ll do it now.
The army last won the EuroLeague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but they could not show their best basketball every time.
There is an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
Before the games, I don’t have any rituals, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

I have only warm memories of Rome.
It will be a special game for me, but it doesn’t matter.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game, which she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.

Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We didn't have enough courage in the attack.
Benfica are above class, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking their points away.
It's quite real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
In home games, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I repeat as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
The head coach of “real” Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).

The match was not easy, because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always ceremonially hid danger.
I will not say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I’m happy that we didn’t miss the balls and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it again as many times as I want.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi"

We will remind, "SE" will conduct its text broadcast.
“Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players,” UEFA’s official website quoted De Rossi as saying. -
It is difficult to play with blue-garnet, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individuals.
To leave them, we will have to plow throughout the match and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it goes into the woods, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.

I hope that I will leave in the next match in the starting lineup, - quotes "R-Sport" words Yezhov.
I am not an expert on goalkeepers, I am a goalkeeper myself, we do not show repetitions of goals missed, so it is difficult to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was admitted to the hospital with a viral infection.

Steven Hogg used the girl’s phone to get pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to beg for child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered in the Internet message service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five images, after examining the computers found at this address and found “relevant” queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it, as it could “attract pedophiles” and then he “pretends that he’s a policeman to scare them.”
Commissioner for the forensic perpetrator Eilid Robertson told the court of the sheriff in Dundee: “He said that this addiction, he is addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that he made inquiries on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be policemen to frighten the pedophiles.
He was interviewed about talking to an unknown person who sent him images and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then a face-to-face bet was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and “Playstation” to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating the bail on 25 January this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
The defendant’s lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg’s not to make Hogg’s list of perpetrators of crimes of a sexual nature, since it can be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, until they received certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before the hearing on other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of persons who have committed crimes of a sexual nature even before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Reads the Wrong Speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest state leader, fell down the stairs from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread over social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by parliamentary opposition statements that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe while making an appeal.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was Mugabe’s speech that repeated on Tuesday.
Member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change Innousten Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled “Death,” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the noted members of parliament that immunity would end in the parliament building, and once they were out, parliamentary immunity did not work.
A member of parliament said Morgan Zwangirai’s party is “concerned” about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to cut from 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and reduction of service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
Deductions as a result of the expected reduction of jobs will be approximately 2.7 billion. US dollars since the fourth quarter, said in a statement Hewlett-Packard.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to growing demands from our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion. US dollars and “will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
So divides the company, formed in the 1930’s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed “Silicon Valley’s birthplace.”
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization in order to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest event in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that only September is still, and that provided that if the restoration of Wilshire goes according to plan, then nothing will prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championships next summer remains in question.
The most common thing in this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season preparation.
Wenger: “This injury is not threatening his career.”
It's just not a completely healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with ankles or injuries he had before.
These can be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also allowed, there is a contraindicated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only in 65 of the 157 games of Arsenal in the league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the situation for Arsenal, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs that have missed most of the days missed due to injuries.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of getting stuck in a malign circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back in service after an injury, you are vulnerable for a while – during this time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to do it.
I hope he recovers physically, I am sure of it, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal begins a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo-Zagreb and continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debyushi and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girou instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an undisputed favorite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
“Dynamo” did not lose any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as “Invincible”.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was 10 in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that Arsenal has learned the lesson learned last season, when the team was defeated in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with little hope of bringing the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of men's friendship
The absence of such stories catches the eye, especially when you consider how desperate the need for men has become of frankness, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women to occur.
In an attempt to understand the problem of “Campaign against Unhappy Life” declared 2015 the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to embrace this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2 000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if the patient has a fairly large number of friends “in a normal mood”, the chances of a cure are doubled.
Equally for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halve the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it is necessary that it should be.
In an era when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of the answer is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life is doubling the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if in reality loneliness reigns.
Such a superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noted, the creator of the video game, for money, you will not buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not through his work, but rather through a person who manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joa's Humor and Chandler's constant embrace, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighs on Rachel - everything comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As the Samaritance officer told me, “My role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal moods underscores how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often those men who come to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strongly, as well as the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the unobtrusive moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where the holiday has fully restored the scenery, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better - if in Starbucks you see a lonely person, smile and say "Hello".
In advance, it is not possible to guess what benefits friendship can bring.
The Friends series is shown on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria along with Blaze Matuidy and Edinson Cavani celebrates goals in the goal of Malmo.
Angel de Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is a match report and a reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint Germain started their game in the Champions League with an extremely convenient 2:0 win against Malmo at Park de Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first Champions League game started as a PSG player to set the direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a score of 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, since they were not aimed at the playoffs, but at continuing the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be useless in the attack and later replace him on the field against a team against a team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away at the Champions League, so it’s worth to win with a score of 2:0, to give the opponents the problems and play well in defense – this is a good start, even if there are still moments that we need to refine during the season,” Blan said.
It's a promising one.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret not scoring one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2:2 in the match with Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was pushed back into the background by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of bringing PSG to a new level in Europe, after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran to the pass from Marco Verratti behind the Malmo defense and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone then expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the strike of Nikola Djurdzic, in which the ball flew past the far bar of the goal of Kevin Trapp on the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times failed itself with ineffective transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not realize at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he showed himself much more skillful in accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted punch that passed in the rod to the barley past Viland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic corroborated the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had regarding the return to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Wieland at close range did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before the replacement Esequiel Lavezzi did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Malmo coach Agee Harade later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

During the meeting with the head of the city administration of Tyumen Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense", because a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: the Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of OJSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment to Trans-Urals was discussed.
At the end of September, a meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled.
The enlarged consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a landfill for testing many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is extremely important not to destroy the groundwork, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Affi Brown, saying behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of the show Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“The variety is appropriate when you’re casting for the movie itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Stunned Brown, not believing his ears, resentfully exclaimed "Wow! Wow, it's okay. Well, well, all the time, while the actor from the "Martian" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
“I would like the participants – no matter who will be the director – to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to stick to,” Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film Dear White People advocated for the film to be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was sharply opposed to saying that “in the end we can not get what we want.”
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproval comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily spoke about the video: “Clarifying the essence of diversity from Matt Damon is the only black person in the room that is so much pain.”
The tweet scored more than 5000 retweets and 4000 "likes".
Damon’s statements appear just when the literate coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer, Black Lives Matter has gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like the books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether this group will be considered as a group of haters.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of figures of show business, producers and media magnas invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior Awards First Champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home a prize of $ 1 million.
On this sports show, the 7-th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two participants - Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a rise on a rope 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first task and met at a given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior", which passed the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task as three seconds faster, which made it the winner.
After winning, inherited with incredible work, Caldiero, who was shocked by winning a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“It’s incredible to think about it, I’ve never earned or live on more than $10 000 a year,” Isaac told E! Such a serious jump in their income.
Suddenly, such a... I never imagined how it was... The future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wade met with journalists of The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, will not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant receives the money.
“If the players who have finished more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them,” Wyd said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and change lives, it still gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He is happy with what he did.
He received tons of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin to shoot in the spring of 2016.
The Detrotus Tigers quietly bypass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, Tigers now ranks last in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly won against Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a total of 5-4 on Target-field.
The Twins missed the chance to reduce the gap from Houston Astros to half a game and take second place in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For the Detriotians, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which eluded most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they turn out,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
The Tigerst whistlebow Alfredo Simon contributed to the attacks, causing Detroit to score three points in the first two innings, then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 of the innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start for nine exits.
“I just want to end the year with good performance,” said Simon.
The pitcher on the replacement can not quit in every game, and so I want to go deeper into the game.
The appointed repulsorant of the Tigers, Victor Martinez managed to recapture three blows and achieved two wounds - the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since four strikes against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good bat," Osmus said.
He performed well in (the quality of the bett), noticeably better in the bat and retained this quality for the game.
After gaining three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
The central host Byron Buxton opened an inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Reitfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bow, took the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dojier received a strikeout on a flap from Simon before his place was taken by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy beat Moer, the only player on the way, before the new reclaimer Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-to-core "single" to the left from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the out and comparing the wound on the second base, VerHagenu managed to bring the third Baisman Trevor Pluff to be beaten in the double-play.
It was the 27th time for the leading player of the major league this season, when Pluff kicked the ball on the double-play.
After Detroit added a heels in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned a “double” in the space between the outfits against Bruce Rondon’s Tigers-closing pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikers and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpublished Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the honored pitcher, who was on the list of injured until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
“Definitely not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but as the game evolved, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to the second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wowet at two out of Reitfielder J. D. Martinez was brought by Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 in 21" with runners in a productive position.
The player of the third base Nick Castellanos followed by the “single”, bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thereby the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers increased their score in the second inning, receiving a one-out “double” from Katcher James McCann and a two-out-out single from the central battering Anthony Gowse, and that became 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit him very well, but he hit the right point.
Hughes, whose shots were considered, threw the third inning that did not bring points, after which he was replaced by the right-handed relief A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three wounds to six hits and a wax with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Pticher right-wing Tigers Anibal Sánchez dropped out of the players in connection with the stretch of right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had Sánchez surgery on his shoulder back in 2007.
For Sanchez, which is on the list of injured since mid-August, it is planned to launch on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, Levitch Pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the list of injured and will come out against the Twins.
Norris, who came out with the Tigers in four starts since its acquisition in exchange for pitchcher-left David Price on July 30, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in the games from August 20 due to stretching of the scab muscles.
The Tigers and the Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4, 43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book “Sun to God” was received in the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book “Pray to God: its meaning and place in Islam”, reports “Interfax” with reference to the Chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhray.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections to the participants in the process.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the state Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such stupid things themselves,” he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
From the prosecutor's office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk appeal came on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as an “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, “extremist” quotes from the Qur’an were called “We worship you and pray to You for help,” “Do not call anyone along with Allah.”
Kadyrov called the decision on the book “Shaitans and provocateurs”.
He called for legislative ban on court decisions concerning the texts of the scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law according to which it is forbidden to take decisions in court regarding directly the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook to remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of Facebook intends to work with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
So, on the eve of the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry of Justice, together with the specialists of the social network, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to track and remove incorrect comments to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for deleting their recording.
To facilitate the prompt blocking of illegal content should also be organizations whose specialists are collecting complaints received from users of the social network against offensive posts.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was made after xenophobic sentiments had increased sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which engulfed the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany today, all the points intended for the accommodation of refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country’s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, which contained prisoners and prisoners of war under the Nazi regime.
On the Moscow cemeteries there will be zones for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovo, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinsk cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troyekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other parts of the city.
About this portal m24.ru said Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budgetary institution "Ritual".
Relaxation zones will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such “correstrials” visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, zones for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, builders will try to preserve the existing forests in the maximum possible volume.
Green spaces will serve as a live fence, which will separate the recreation areas and squares allocated directly for burial places.
Experts of the GBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to refuse hedges at burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with which visitors to the cemeteries will be able to find out GPS coordinates and license plates of burials.
In June of this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services, depending on the time of year.
So, the digging grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles less, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, the prices for all types of ritual services have risen in price by an average of 10 percent.
In the Olnin forests five days later found a lost mushroom picker.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
To find grief-mushroom managed thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man managed to find after a helicopter connected to the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for mushrooms and birches, but did not return to the evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and caring residents from a neighboring village were raised in search of a mushroom grower - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter of a fire and rescue center.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the detachment of the fire and rescue Center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, completely different.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He had a long distance at his age.
Miraculously survived.
Gribnik was taken to the Yeltrine Central District Hospital unconscious, in extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, the doctors do not represent at all.

Emergency An-2 sat on a prosec in the fraternal taiga.
Directly on the slack sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties or casualties, but the plane itself received significant damage upon landing.
An-2 made an official flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, co-pilot and a flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Fraternal Transport Prosecutor’s Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
An investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed its plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction on an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
The liner was denied engines and on-board electronics, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
Nobel laureate: globalization
Globalization processes should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, said the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection of HSE, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between the countries were becoming more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“And these forecasts have largely come true,” Muskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have received a serious GDP growth per capita.
But not everything is so rosy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “possessors” and “poor” in poor countries, which manifested in great inequality of income, or rather, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why Global Markets Didn’t Reduce Inequality in Developing Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by HSE.
Together with Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income differences in poor countries increase as globalization grows, recalls HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if workers in the level of C from poor countries are growing due to cooperation with employees B from the rich, then D workers do not feel growth or their salaries fall altogether.
The final effect is that internationalization of production will increase the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to increase the level of inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskins offer a surprisingly beautiful model, alternative to the Rycardian theory of comparative advantages.
It allows you to explain why globalization led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, Head of the HSE Department of Mathematics.
And as any powerful theory, I am sure, it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Muskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means on this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no case calls for a halt in the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: a living connection of times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities in Russia - in September celebrates its 2000-year anniversary.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of derbant carpets and the Day of Open Churches, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have descended from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazarian Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern boards, which grow in the courtyard of the derbant Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Departies - monuments of wildlife".
The shadow of spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque will be poured with fragrant tea and treated with Dagestani delicacies - honey figs, persimmons, mushmula, tortillas-miracle, yirana and sweets.
In Derbent from time immemorial, they used large samovaras to water the tea of numerous guests at a time.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 aHjra.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in the scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults are based on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of poultry houses put pigeon cots in the yards, under trees, in attics.
An exciting spectacle is a floach of white pigeons into the sky, similar to the flashes of festive fireworks.
For the purpose of defense from the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters into the sea, this building locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has survived almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with a pile and without it, with complex ornaments and bizarre kaim.
The development of the city began with Magals - quarters with one-storey stone buildings.
For many years, the Magalas have not changed much.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water supply built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
To this day, ancient sources have come, in which the locals are still drinking water.
Many derbents prefer water from taps from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Irrigation and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters are now making wonderful ceramic products both for practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a stretched rope, which is attended by students of the Republican School of Circus Art.
The history of amazing and risky skill dates back several centuries.
A new trend - among the rope walkers, you can increasingly see girls.
In the premises of the former Girl bath today there is a museum "Culture and life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides accompanied by friends were washed here, and now anyone can see a vaulted-dominsk hall, hot and cold pools that have gone into the past of bathing accessories.
Most of Derbent’s homes have hot water, but baths and pairs are as popular these days as in the old days.
About the benefits of warming up the body with steam is written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The festival "Commonwealth", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, ethno-faste of many districts of Dagestan take part.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
Yellow from time to time sarcophagi are carved from whole stone blocks and oriented, as usual in the Arabs, along the west-east axes.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Jakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been on this site for many years.
Techniques of the barge are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house in which the Decembrist writer-decabrist exiled to the Caucasus lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and everyday life of citizens.
Chaikhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench thirst, chat with friends and solve some working problems.
As in past times, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of teahouse.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian levels.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning perfectly the folk Avar, Dargin, tatsk, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, local residents sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, derbants discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall the episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business “game to the airport”.
In the capital, a new form of training is being tested.
Four hundred students have tried their way to the airport staff.
To do this, Domodedovo installed models of three air harbors.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the real airport, there is hell.
For the one that has settled in the Domodedov hangar - a standard set of tasks that beginners have to solve.
In one hangar fit three major airports from around the world.
Today they employ four hundred students from the capital’s colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the internal world of the air harbor.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, turnover of luggage - they were entrusted even by buses on the airfield, ladders and passenger inspection.
And the passengers are all problematic.
One has a mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in a minimum time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual funds, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
“For failure to perform the relevant tasks, a fine is charged against them,” Dmitry Khilko, a financial analyst at the game, explains in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
What is happening is closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of training.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will, in fact, become new models of the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment,” says Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the Field of Training and Additional Professional Education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.
Students are not up to global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a day off.
But the evaluations for this exam had a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I’ve ever seen!
“I received them for responding to a claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner,” Sergei Shuvalov, a participant in the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Aeroporport team, was pleased.
The best judges, as they say, were taken to a pencil to invite to their work by the time of completion of their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center, which was operating at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American center of the US Embassy at the All-Russian State Library. M.I. Rudino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by Russia’s recent recent issues of the Russian government’s commitment to ties between Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and at other difficult moments of the long history of our countries’ relations,” U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50 thousand Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
A typical situation: four officials are in front of the judge’s table of Judge Swanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn’t give you a 110-page order to make you laugh at him, says Kumar. -
If there is at least one more brick, we will order to demolish all the existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NWT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the incomplete 60 years since the independence of the strengthened industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungle into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large megacities, where the development of infrastructure does not improve for rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and the remaining residential areas are cut down for construction with new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “impossible”.
Sometimes court decisions are really impossible to fulfill within the period set by the court, confirms the lawyer for environmental cases Raj Panjwani.
However, the impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least, they force responsible persons to move.
“His main goal is to shake this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects: the termination of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of the judicial pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite the sharply fallen popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swantter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the government of Delhi about entering and outgoing vehicles, and also made an offer to purchase 10 thousand additional buses, having previously learned in the factories whether they are able to fulfill such an order.
As the attention of the court began to get sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principal judge was the program to clean the Ganges River, with pompom announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and turning into a cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, the judge is hot. -
You continue to pollute the river because you think it's Ganges, he'll take all our sins.
It’s the river we worship and see what you do with it every day.
Cleaning the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million women bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund, the proceeds from the sale of his suit, in which he dated Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while at least eight billion is required for cleaning the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India is still a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an impermissible luxury,” says Malika Bhanot, an activist at Zov Ganges. -
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development.”

Xi Jinping calls for economics to be more open to the world
The economy should become more open to the world to spur its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to a group that is tasked with leadership reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16-th meeting of the Committee of the Central Lead Group for the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and will provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulation, change the rules of border control, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and the revision of the registration system for residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production will be compiled, inaccessible to investment.
The system will be gradually adjusted through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will provide the market with a more significant role in the distribution of resources, ensuring legality in the business sphere and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers granted to them to companies, thereby ensuring that companies themselves will conduct their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow the border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “grung-person card”, will be facilitated by optimizing requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yongshan and Zhang Gaoli.
