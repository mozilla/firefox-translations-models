Germany is the first in Europe to introduce &quot;indeterminate gender&quot; when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to allow registration of children born as hermaphrodites to indicate &quot;indeterminate&quot; instead of male or female.
The child&#39;s parents will have the right to leave the &quot;sex&quot; column on the birth certificate blank for the time being.
Instead of &quot;F&quot; (female) or &quot;M&quot; (male), parents may temporarily write &quot;X&quot; (indeterminate).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents into rushing to &quot;clarify&quot; the sex.
According to statistics, one out of 2 thousand newborns in the world is born as a hermaphrodite.
Anger over the sentencing of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 dead in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict passed on the last of the conspirators to stand trial and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia&#39;s most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the bombs used in the attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of a massacre in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a spate of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that the man, dubbed a &quot;bomber&quot; for his reputation as a master bomb maker, should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his associates nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must face the firing squad,” Ms. Cortin told AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have any more grandchildren and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy&#39;s Bar where a backpack bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times while connected to a life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
To keep him alive, well, there&#39;s no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the latest in the Bali attack to stand trial.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
&quot;He didn&#39;t give up,&quot; Ms Cortin said.
Until recently, he had no regrets at all about how much grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms Cortin says.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after gaining a foothold in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
&quot;We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type,&quot; Interfax quoted Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with the French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
Today we discussed some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft is established in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
&quot;I hope that someday it will also be delivered to France,&quot; the Russian prime minister emphasized.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the 100-passenger segment.
Goalie “Chicago” Nikolai Khabibulin stressed that he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Khabibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, but in the last two games I didn&#39;t succeed, - Khabibulin quotes CSNChicago.
- I need to find confidence in training, I should probably approach them like games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few goals, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I&#39;m not happy.
It doesn&#39;t matter what happens in front of my gate.
I&#39;m still working on myself so as not to miss so many pucks.
It&#39;s great that my teammates support me, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to play them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I&#39;ll just try to play the next match better.
Power engineers of Dnepropetrovsk region have launched a unique program to save... stork nests
In the old days, in order to bring storks to the court, the villagers installed a wheel from a cart on a high pole, and the heavy nest held well on it.
Such special supports have not been installed for a long time, so the storks have chosen the poles of power lines - intertwined branches rest on wires, thanks to which the stork house stands securely.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, a stork family has been living for twenty years, began to notice how the nest is sinking, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new branches on top, and the bottom layer has already sunk between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it’s a pity for the family of storks that nested at the farmstead every year, brought out and fed three or four chicks over the summer, but I don’t want to be left without light either.
As soon as the birds flew away to warmer climes, Anya&#39;s grandmother called the Tsarichansky Distribution Zone, which owns the support.
And I did not even expect that they would respond so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding on, - said Sergei Berezovsky, technical director of DTEK Dneprooblenergo.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any moment, the birds could die from an electric discharge.
Yes, and local residents risked being left without electricity due to damaged wires.
Therefore, linemen began an operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted trainings for employees of regional networks.
The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was calculated that more than 50 stork &quot;apartments&quot; are in disrepair in the region.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a base for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Later, the storks themselves will complete their dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovsky district.
A new reinforced concrete pole was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, in the courtyard of grandmother Anya.
Here the platform was fixed in its original place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their &quot;apartment&quot; has undergone a major overhaul.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected for four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnepropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
Recently, sad news spread throughout the region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka, Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of pheasant hunting, poachers shot a swan family that lived on a local pond for fun.
Noble birds were not at all afraid of people - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, having heard the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolovsky regional department of militia find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
American Boeing stuck in Chita preparing for takeoff
An American aircraft that conducted observation flights over Russian territory under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the air harbor of the city.
The airport management allowed the plane to take off, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will head to the United States.
As reported, a plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not allowed to leave the Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and has 34 member states.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main tasks of the Treaty are the development of transparency, assistance in monitoring the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, expansion of opportunities for preventing crises and resolving crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we are back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the unrest in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia &quot;Shinnik&quot; - &quot;Spartak&quot;.
I am in favor of the organizers of sporting events being responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not entirely correct.
It is necessary to organize the fans, the clubs must invite their stewards, and not let things take their course.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will deal with this problem closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process to my place.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, give the law quickly.
It feels like the fans of Bayern came to Yaroslavl and arranged all this.
And we are bystanders.
In general, it&#39;s terrible - to see how the podium is watered from a hose.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I have a feeling that we are back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who tipped off gang leader about police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to crime boss Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed was jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied crime boss Neil Scarborough with classified information about an investigation into his drug trafficking activities after he came under threat from his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed by criminals as a &quot;tough lawyer&quot;, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officers spotted Scarborough, 32, leaving three packets of cocaine outside a lawyer&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta &quot;regularly used&quot; a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at the time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine and more than £200,000 in cash in a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, leaked information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was shamed at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of willful obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer&#39;s exposure came after police investigating Scarborough found he had been on the phone with Ditt on a regular basis since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt&#39;s home in Blackburn and placing 60% pure drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer&#39;s dustbins.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough called Ditt repeatedly, who was at a dinner at Blackburn Rovers&#39; Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was a client, and insisted that their communication was a &quot;lawyer&#39;s secret.&quot;
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
When questioned by the police, he said that along with the workplace, he also had a home office, and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell what detectives know about them.
In her accusatory speech, Ann White said, &quot;If anyone knows not to break the law, it&#39;s a criminal defense attorney.&quot;
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense lawyer by getting too intimate with certain clients.
The contact we&#39;re talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly turn out to be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely gone beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to certain clients, Scarborough in particular, and let his lack of interest be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and stated: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.&quot;
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.&quot;
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of the criminal gangs, who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
Mr. Ditt was being investigated by the Lancashire Serious Organized Crime Unit, which had already secured a conviction for him on three counts of possession of cocaine and now also on obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to getting the perpetrators justly punished.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced in total to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&amp;A in which he says his dream job is a lawyer representing death row clients in America, his ideal dinner companion is Muhammad Ali, and his job motivation is inequality .
Jet makers feud over seat width when big orders are at stake
A fierce dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of long-haul tourist class seats, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy passengers, whose interests are not always at the forefront of airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them playing a key role in the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main US rival Boeing says it&#39;s up to airlines to decide.
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell ever larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft—especially whether 9 or 10 people sit abreast—is central to the cost-effectiveness claims of new &quot;mini-airbus&quot; designs.
Boeing says its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy class seats over 17 inches wide, with 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged 9 abreast.
Aircraft giants often trade blows on technical issues through advertisements in the professional press.
And now Airbus is speaking directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead with over 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be like by showing financiers a slide of three people huddled together in a restaurant titled &quot;Would you agree to this?&quot;
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said Airbus head of sales John Leahy.
People put on weight as diets change, but airplane seats haven&#39;t changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American male aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the US Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st century American male is 39.7 inches, according to US Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims its competitor is sticking to the seating concept of the 1950s, when the average waistline of those recently dubbed the &quot;jet public&quot; was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus&#39;s seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn&#39;t get involved in decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is more space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders worth at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, enough to change the balance between US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is exactly what is fueling the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent improvement in profitability per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing&#39;s performance claims are based in part on a comparison of the 777X&#39;s 10-seat rows with the original 777&#39;s 9-seat row layout.
The unit cost gain is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram in more seats and make their aircraft more competitive with our designs,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort for Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat rows for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer tighter seating, which could go hand in hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, commercially, the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but do offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling jet salesmen even carry tape measures with them to test competing layouts.
While touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer very dense aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus is offering the A350 with 10-seat rows but says it hasn&#39;t sold one yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the backing of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but could detract from the wave of 777X sales.
Oleinikov: a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow Region Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow Region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the volume of budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidized.
Within the framework of budget security, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget,&quot; Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - had budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many districts is less than 3 million rubles, &quot;this is not enough at all.&quot;
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is over 70%, &quot;at the same time, there is a decrease in the quality of services,&quot; Oleinikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region to think through by the end of November which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the administrative management system.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Prior to this, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the suburbs, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaysky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsky, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for consolidation of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Igor Bryntsalov, chairman of the Moscow Regional Duma, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region are planned to be united within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that less than a third of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region have an &quot;acceptable&quot; financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Security concerns in Mozambique rise as powerful people clash
Beneath a staring down statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique&#39;s founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace in one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the return of peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed from her business suit to a T-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the capital&#39;s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the most violent clashes since the armistice more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgency supported first by the white Rhodesian authorities and later by the apartheid-era South African government as part of an effort to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a booming economy as the discovery of vast offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from the likes of Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States .
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17th.
Attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&#39;s leader, Renamo&#39;s spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza attempted to allay fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever was left of his strength to try and prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.&quot;
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo&#39;s rejection of the 1992 peace deal.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo&#39;s non-compliance with the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but in all seriousness,” Masanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions that have been intensified by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) head-on,” said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo&#39;s party, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo&#39;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve in this election.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capabilities Renamo has, but she has already carried out devastating and swift attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended rail use for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened dissatisfaction with the government, and many people also worry about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who should find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in effect for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the US to ease regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, as long as they remain in Airplane Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which has required US airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated they have no plans to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are reviewing the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
&quot;The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain security at all times, and passengers to follow the safety rules communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already been in discussions with the Aviation Safety Authority to expand the use of its Wi-Fi inflight entertainment system, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator&#39;s guidance.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&#39;s consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the customer experience now that it (in-flight wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” a spokesman said. .
Qantas said it will adhere to the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look into the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to prove that their aircraft are immune to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage allowances and passenger instructions.
“Once an airline has tested and validated the immunity of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, the group recommends that heavier devices be placed under seats or in overhead bins during takeoff and landing.
Obama backtracks on his health care words
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backpedaled on his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot;
With hundreds of thousands of people receiving cut-off notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading the American public.
Obama tweaked his original public pledge yesterday.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called &quot;the buzz in the news&quot; about the termination of services, Obama urged Americans receiving the notices to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans for the same price or even less than what was predicted.
“You will get better terms,” he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that the 5% of the population who buy their own insurance could be forced to change plans because their coverage doesn&#39;t meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans straight: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been going &quot;horribly bad&quot; since October.
“I’m just as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
“I really want to regain your trust.”
An exasperated Sibelius dropped the line, picked up by a live microphone, to an aide sitting behind her in a House hearing yesterday after a heated debate with Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she herself must enter Obama&#39;s health care program.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov that she is now forcing on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can rest assured that the case will be conducted in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
&quot;We can guarantee compliance with the laws,&quot; Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Herault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
&quot;I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture in respect of the detained citizen,&quot; Mr. Herault is quoted by RIA Novosti.
&quot;Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate laws,&quot; Dmitry Medvedev said in his turn.
According to him, the activity of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He stressed that these facilities are &quot;like a powder keg&quot; and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
A friend of Semyon Varlamov said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
The friend of the hockey player Semyon Varlamov, Yevgenia Vavrinyuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, Russian News Service reports.
&quot;He has no idea how to stop drinking,&quot; - said, in particular, the woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were injured.
Varlamov himself turned himself in to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete from moving around the country, but forbade him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to 6 years in prison for domestic violence.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform game for free
Blizzard has released its 1994 platform game Blackthorne for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game has become available on Battle.net under Blizzard&#39;s classic games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not yet available.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not look different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform game that Blizzard released 19 years ago was originally released on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight against Sarlac&#39;s minions and protect the planet&#39;s inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its rebranding as Blizzard Entertainment.
Prior to that, it was called Silicon &amp; Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
Coulson resorted to hacking his phone to check for a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to corroborate false information about an affair by Charles Clark, then home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World had received false news that Clarke was dating his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Polby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcair to break into Polby&#39;s voice mail and lay in wait for her at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand outside someone&#39;s house, hoping to take someone by surprise, he is a person who likes to offer a story to people to see, what will they say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World used three methods to investigate the stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say &quot;Oh yes!&quot;
Rumors of Clarke&#39;s affair first came to the attention of the News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told, &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, she&#39;s with Charles.&quot;
A cassette containing voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcair&#39;s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private detective&#39;s computer that listed Ms. Polby and her sister as &quot;Projects&quot;.
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby&#39;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised surveillance of Ms. Polby&#39;s movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, &quot;I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to discuss with Charles.&quot;
Mr. Edis said Coulson&#39;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other powerful people, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman while he was dating his then-married co-defendant Rebecca Brooks.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlback, and Weatherup confessed to hacking the phones.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no grouping &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;, to which Leps was ranked in the United States
The Bratsky Krug group, to which Washington ranked singer Grigory Leps, does not appear in the databases of Russian security officials.
As Interfax was told in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Department of the Treasury put Grigory Leps on the watch list on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;, all databases were checked, but of such a grouping was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called &quot;Russian mafia&quot;, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
&quot;Even in the name itself - &#39;Brotherly Circle&#39;, there is a certain element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
&quot;All this is very similar to a PR campaign,&quot; the source said.
On October 31, the US Treasury Department announced that Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov were put on their watchlists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having links with certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps &quot;serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.&quot;
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them &quot;nonsense.&quot;
In 2011, US President Barack Obama referred to the Fraternal Circle syndicate as a &quot;significant transnational organized crime group&quot; and directed the Treasury to &quot;undermine and disrupt their global criminal operations.&quot;
The blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails blocking his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the States.
Scientists have shed light on how a dog&#39;s tail movements are related to its mood.
Earlier research has shown that contented dogs wag their tails to the right (from the dog&#39;s point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tails predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say other members of the canine family can notice and respond to these subtle differences in tail wagging.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: &quot;It is well known that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in generating triggers that evoke positive or negative emotions.&quot;
Here we tried to look at this in other species as well.
He added that just like in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile tail wagging of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We showed the dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and point the tail more to the left or to the right.&quot;
When the animals saw the otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging dog), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of a wagging dog), their heart rate increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they should and should not be concerned about.
He remarks, “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs and often their tail wagging to one side is associated with more friendly behavior and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.”
The researchers say these results could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal&#39;s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides make a difference in dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when facing an aggressive dog and to the right when facing a contented dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs approached the robot dog more often when its tail wagged to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming alarmed—the opposite behavior of the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the various studies didn&#39;t fully perceive the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is ample evidence in various mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point one way and sometimes the other.
Are Europe&#39;s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring business representatives together and identify what changes Britain&#39;s wealth and job creators want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to share their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide cross-section of UK businesses by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking to export outside of Europe, with a focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than waste time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU&#39;s tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with businesses saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in a European trade zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Last and most revealing, our survey of business executives found that a clear majority wanted the UK to pursue a treaty-change course and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been seen across businesses of all sizes and largest business groups, shows that businesses are pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that will bring powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving treaty changes and better terms for the UK would provide a 16% shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British businesses support his plan to renegotiate the terms of the UK&#39;s membership in the EU.
It also shows that businesses expect the revision to result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey results show, for businesses this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental regulatory changes in Brussels.
Turkish politician goes on hunger strike against Syrian border wall
In mid-October, authorities began building a separation wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Aishe Gokhan, went on a hunger strike to protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti was told in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
Nusaybin Mayor Ayse Gokhan, a member of the PMD, has gone on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a death struggle, the party&#39;s press office said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, Kurds have been crossing this border freely for half a century.
&quot;This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never accept,&quot; party officials quoted Ayse Gokhan as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of a separation wall is planned to be held in Nusaybin on November 7.
This morning in the Saratsky district, the driver of the Peugeot car drove into the oncoming lane at 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway and collided with a bus with six people on it.
This was reported by the press service of the State Emergency Service in the Odessa region.
As a result of the incident, the 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured, with a pinched leg.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused hospitalization.
Also, ambulance officers examined all other passengers.
Rescuers lifted the bus with a crane and freed the bus driver, whose leg was caught in the bus door.
You shouldn&#39;t be a vegan in Siberia: hothouse tomato can&#39;t replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti correspondent found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot endure the winter without loss to their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate for them, say Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil by the liter
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia it is at least unhealthy to adhere to such strict dietary standards.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with plant proteins.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet,&quot; nutritionist Marina Bogai is sure.
She cites the example of fish containing an essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed oil.
&quot;To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!&quot; says the nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the conditions of our realities, high demands are placed on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
&quot;If a person restricts himself on animal products, accordingly, he lacks this calorie content,&quot; the specialist says.
Dietitian Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned for better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people don’t want to nibble on a cucumber, but on hot soup or something more satisfying,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is definitely not enough for good nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have sufficient vitamin levels in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow lies in May, is inappropriate.
The body needs energy to live, and this is, first of all, fat,&quot; the physician states.
Doctors say that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them defective.
Pregnant women also need a high content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get enough of them,” Bogai is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, &quot;to play with those toys that he wants.&quot;
He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
But children still need to eat well.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
&quot;The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow,&quot; she says.
All interviewed medical specialists agree on the low quality of vegetables and fruits grown in winter in greenhouses and imported.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains a smaller amount of trace elements we need than (grown) in the open field.
&quot;The quality of the products is not the same,&quot; says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more yields is detrimental to quality.
“Apples do not turn brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and unflavored,” the physician gives examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
Vera Petruk, head of the laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology for Agrarian Problems, disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables in greenhouses.
If they try to drive out more per square meter, then, of course, they will water more often and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,&quot; she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the producer.
Russia is out of the fight for urban pollution by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most metropolitan areas of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where strict quotas have been introduced for the increase in the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced congestion charges into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are being introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a &quot;five-year clean air plan&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
Li Kunsheng, director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told Kommersant that the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5 .2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% in fuel use per vehicle.
Motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution, according to the agency.
Among the main measures of the program are restrictions on the use of motor vehicles, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city&#39;s &quot;Green Five-Year Plan&quot; measures include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel, a restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (except In addition, the creation of incentive financial programs for replacing old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing&#39;s automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars from driving within the Fifth Ring Road (there are six in total in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle&#39;s license plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars on based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot;, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on city streets.
Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car trips are obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only if they are completely universal.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises related to the structure of its car fleet, where there are two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow car fleet).
The other day, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads that are half the required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storages, not to expand, but to shorten the roadway (so that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal vehicles within the boundaries of the territory of the historical center&#39;s buffer zone (total territory of about 3212 ha, covering a number of central districts of the city).
The tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) on oil at the same time as a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise taxes, will lead to a rise in fuel prices.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
Ride through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in a rural area in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There aren&#39;t that many doctors in this West African country - only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of CNN&#39;s 10 main characters of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to be CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall back into unconsciousness, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
If we had money, we would take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father to crowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It&#39;s not easy,” Bwelle said.
- You can leave home at 5 in the morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending is privately owned.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a physician himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded ASCOVIME, a non-profit organization that organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others pack into wagons, tie medical supplies to the roofs, and drive across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like real heroes: it&#39;s a celebration of song and dance and the finest accommodations the locals have to offer.
The free medical care in these villages is truly something to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his big smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We host 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the area within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates—documents needed for school that many poor families simply can&#39;t afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating room and sanitize equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an unbearable pace, but the purposefulness of the brigade is usually helped to maintain the village musicians.
“They beat drums all night to keep us awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year and they know their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work as a surgeon, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job that he says provides 60% of his nonprofit&#39;s funding; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
&quot;I don&#39;t even know when he sleeps,&quot; said Cathy O&#39;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Bwelle&#39;s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O&#39;Malley coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in his mission, this is a practice opportunity they would never have at home.
“We were able to assist in surgeries where we helped remove bloodstains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O&#39;Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle pays for their food, transportation and education.
&quot;He&#39;s a hero, no doubt about it,&quot; O&#39;Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the near-constant workload is not an ordeal.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping the promise made to his father - this is what brings him great joy.
“I&#39;m so happy when I&#39;m doing this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I&#39;m doing.

The &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States finally got a new name - &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;
This week, the black list of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America has been replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury has included three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the Brotherhood Circle.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the US blacklist includes 22 people involved in the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; and six organizations affiliated with it.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubts that such an organization really exists.
&quot;The &#39;Circle of Brothers&#39; claim sounds more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal gangs,&quot; organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti said earlier.
In his opinion, the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot;.
&quot;I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,&quot; the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted Mr. Galeotti as saying.
Professor of George Mason University Liz Shelley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
&quot;If they act together, it looks more like a criminal network, but not an organization,&quot; the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quotes her as saying.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; unites, to a greater extent, close associates of the Russian kingpin Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Khasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who added to the list in 2012, were closely connected with Ded Khasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Ded Khasan&#39;s nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities are not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, they were all united rather by common financial and criminal interests, for example, the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Just like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Tony Blair has said he will take the chance to return as British Prime Minister but admits a return is unlikely.
Last night, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since resigning in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his commentary to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peacemaker Quartet.
Asked if he would return to the premiership, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: &quot;Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so ...&quot;
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start were due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
I am very sorry that we were not able to win, - Tmw quotes the words of Allegri.
The team played a solid match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn&#39;t let Lazio do anything.
In the second, the Romans improved, but in general I can&#39;t say that we lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who led the high-level meeting.
British police serve Assange with extradition notice
British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Aussie an &quot;official surrender order&quot; to appear at a police station, adding that he would be subject to further arrest if he did not comply.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex offense charges after exhausting his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on June 19 he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard &quot;handed the 40-year-old man a formal surrender order requiring him to report to the police station on a day and time of our choosing,&quot; a spokesman said.
He is still violating bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the service of the notice to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the US to face possible espionage charges after more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables were published on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel &quot;The Eltyshevs&quot;, translated into French.
Recall that it was this novel of his that became a finalist for four awards: Yasnaya Polyana, Russian Booker, National Bestseller and Big Book.
And last year, the writer was awarded the prize of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of today&#39;s thirty and forty year old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his tough stories and novellas built on modern life material causes heated debate among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the collected articles on Senchin&#39;s prose and journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of &quot;one of the most controversial modern writers,&quot; according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, they are mostly talking about what its participants understand by the word &quot;literature&quot;, how they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life. .
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow including most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviation in the sections &quot;Paragraphs ...&quot;
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former American intelligence officer Edward Snowden will most likely not travel outside of Russia to testify in cases of wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer questions from representatives of the German Prosecutor General&#39;s Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Departure of Edward Snowden outside of Russia is virtually impossible.
&quot;In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by countries that are allies of the United States,&quot; the source said.
&quot;At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General&#39;s Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden,&quot; the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, Hans-Christian Strebele, a member of the German Bundestag, said that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the American intelligence services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival,&quot; Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden&#39;s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of an Interfax source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but he would decide when and how.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret US intelligence operations to spy on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who filed serious charges against him in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the American&#39;s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said that his client got a job at a &quot;large Russian company.&quot;
NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by the German media last week.
According to journalists, the Americans began listening to the Chancellor&#39;s telephone conversations back in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as an intercom system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The rally riders who turn to Bowler have changed.&quot;
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world class events.
We are delighted to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe this format offers a new way to experience the various disciplines of rallying in the UK and abroad, and to prepare participants for the tough conditions and realities of rally raiding.
It was a great pleasure for us to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should study myths and legends as &quot;lifestyle models,&quot; says the author.
The tales of Thor could show that &quot;brute strength cannot defeat subtle cunning&quot; and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will prove to be &quot;too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools,&quot; Crossley-Holland advocates &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate texts.
&quot;I think it&#39;s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said.
I have advocated for their introduction into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the &quot;excessive moralizing&quot; of authors and teachers &quot;discourages interest&quot; from children, and the main ideas are &quot;sublimated&quot; into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language and also wrote The Norse Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have intentions, of course, but you better keep them.” with me&quot;.
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle: to show, not to tell.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive layoffs of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which is almost not slowing down,&quot; said Clemens Grafe, chief economist for Russia at Goldman Sachs, presenting yesterday the investment bank&#39;s quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will start optimizing personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies faced shrinking profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
Russian business cannot help raising salaries, comments Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist at Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to lure employees from outside or keep current ones.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid growth in consumer lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country&#39;s economy.
&quot;We did not see any benefit for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not disperse throughout the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in delinquency on unsecured loans.
They are taken mostly by poor people who have nothing to provide in security.
The interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned,&quot; Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the HSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, not having access to cheap resources, which state-owned banks have, were forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, state-owned banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks do not give up dumping, Russia is facing a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The economist considers the deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks as a harbinger of a massive collapse.
&quot;State-owned banks themselves will not cope with such a situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down even without a crisis of non-payments, according to the investment bank, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, which is included in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, lower inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
&quot;The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil,&quot; he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to decline when the cost of oil is below 90 dollars per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,&quot; said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
&quot;For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,&quot; Clemens Grafe assessed.
Banks use the money received at auctions of the Central Bank not for lending to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
&quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy is not working,&quot; Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to float the ruble by the end of 2015.
But we will either have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially overvalued by 10%.
Ruble only one way - to weaken - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank instills even a shadow of doubt in financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, this could bring down the ruble much more.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel wiretapping
Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor General&#39;s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German chancellor&#39;s phone by US special services.
Snowden expressed his readiness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, - said Hans-Christian Strebele, - that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival. .
Meanwhile, US lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the US spyware scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
FAA: &quot;Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make calls from a mobile phone)&quot;
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on cell phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn&#39;t expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and stowage procedures to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is descending for landing, and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the change.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling like &quot;school attendants&quot; when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet to surf, email, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the internet intellectual game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when the actor was kicked off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off his device at that time. the time the aircraft was at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
In-flight mobile phone calls will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over telephone calls rests with the FCC, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the matter recommended last month that the government allow for greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been mounting pressure on FAAs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no good security reasons for the bans.
Restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce as devices become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more electrically dependent than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years now.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are geared towards the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.
But the signals get stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com was among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company representatives loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-readers and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes device interference is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots confirming that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the change, calling it a smart move for travelers who now use a plethora of technology devices.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, CEO of the United States Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the state security department of the republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to &quot;slander&quot; Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the information attack is being prepared by the Department for Analysis of Social Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People&#39;s Party.
Also, an employee of the department, V. Smirnov, is allegedly a participant in the operation.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work, until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaite announced that she knew about the information attack being prepared for her.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and &quot;the country&#39;s desire for energy independence&quot;
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she stated that the Kremlin treats Lithuania &quot;not respectfully enough.&quot;
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of making &quot;only demands&quot; to Lithuania.
Recall that in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian &quot;milk&quot; to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country&#39;s government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials can begin, which will take several years, but Prof Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying every method available on the market today, only to find that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to be overcome with these modern remedies.” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the production of anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice that were subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren&#39;t given the vaccine &quot;relaxed,&quot; a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To keep antibody levels high, injections had to be given so frequently that they were both expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
&quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they won&#39;t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that might help them kick the habit,&quot; he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for taking hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire can.
The new carry-on fee applies to bags in overhead bins, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers only pay when they arrive at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to make sure they pay up front.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to charge for this,&quot; she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked-in bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees pack as much as they can into carry-on luggage placed in overhead bins, which often leaves space in those bins.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O&#39;Malley said this new collection is not really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier&#39;s most loyal customers say it&#39;s getting harder and harder to find space in overhead bins.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline&#39;s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the gate of a Frontier flight can get to carry a bag for free, while the next person in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O&#39;Malley said the change to procedures on the website and at Frontier&#39;s check-in counters is intended to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier carry-on baggage fee will not start until summer, although a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first carry-on fee three years ago, and Allegiant Air, another discounter, has since followed suit.
The only other airline with such a surcharge is Hungary&#39;s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who keeps a close eye on surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, was recently on a Spirit flight and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit&#39;s unusual carry-on baggage fee.
“The boarding process was the smoothest I have seen in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight break out at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing was swift.&quot;
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and that coffee top-ups will be provided free of charge.
She will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but dropped it seven months later, after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s initiative to charge carry-on baggage where passengers don&#39;t buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest move to drive customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving half as many frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut award miles to 25 percent of her trip miles.
For example, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only select a seat in advance if they purchase tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and unprofitable.
Revenue was down 9 percent and flying capabilities were down nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier&#39;s finances as part of the sale of the airline.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation, which they came close to this summer.
Read more about the weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president in our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said that the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad&#39;s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled declared chemical weapons factories.
A longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad&#39;s days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad got away with the massacre.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called a success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a man ready for cooperation.
Today in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed with a chemical weapon.
Assad is holding out.

Tomic to serve 240 hours for posting extremist video on social media
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory labor for posting an extremist video on a social network, a spokesman for the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation &quot;Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as at humiliating the dignity of a person committed in public.&quot;
&quot;The Leninsky District Court considered this case in a special manner and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work,&quot; the agency&#39;s interlocutor said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents of intersex children can choose &#39;indeterminate gender&#39;
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third sex in children born with intermediate vulva.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to identify any gender of such children, allowing parents to list the gender as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates.
The goal of the law was to take pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions about gender assignment for newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot;
I will remain a doctor-created patchwork of bruises and scars.
Approximately one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;disorders of sexual development&quot; - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, however, most experts in the US say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all. .
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identity, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot;
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
&quot;Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don&#39;t,&quot; he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this happens.
It&#39;s like a riddle about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their condition is not about gender, but about their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typical of both. at the same time or not typical for any of them.
These characteristics can show up in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and physique; primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in employment, as well as the levels of harassment, brutality and bias-motivated crime.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to use male, female, or &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as &quot;asexual&quot;, defending in court the right to maintain an &quot;indeterminate&quot; sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a newscast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, that professedly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also took issue with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is being pulled into a new state where gender is a choice and sexual activity is not, we are overturning two more pillars of civilization.&quot;
One Maryland mother of a newborn baby also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer babies to be gendered at birth.
&quot;Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don&#39;t know the gender of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek god who possessed characteristics of both sexes.
And even just a decade ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything could be erased and then drawn again.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is tricky, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive their assigned gender when they grow up.
&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a &#39;psychiatric emergency&#39;,&quot; Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn&#39;t call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to deal with children with intermediate genitals was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that environmental cues, including social cues—how parents raise a child—interact with a child&#39;s genes and hormones to determine whether a person considers himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision to completely castrate the child, removing also his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Money presented the case as a successful transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still &quot;using that model&quot; right now.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender reassignment surgeries declared themselves &quot;dissatisfied with the outcome.&quot;
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate genitalia.
The doctors couldn&#39;t tell for sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live the &quot;full life&quot; of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&#39;s external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was scheduled for a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Upon learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and having his breasts removed.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others at an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of people with intersex.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice legal association, worries that German law &quot;encourages labeling and stigma.&quot;
&quot;Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an &#39;indeterminate gender&#39;,&quot; she said.
We fear that he will facilitate interference.
We think it&#39;s best to assign male or female and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose a third gender.&quot;
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its assignment at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not get into at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist in Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would &quot;support&quot; both parents and children.
Baratz&#39;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a developmental disorder called Total Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are malfunctioning, Katy has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at 29, Kathy is married and doing her residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Baratz said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.
In that case you are all right - raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We do not need to hastily perform an operation that is irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and removes the anxiety that drives parents because they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which gender he or she is more comfortable with - and that&#39;s wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; in collecting data
US Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that US intelligence agencies sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; when collecting data and wiretapping, however, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about wiretapping of 70 million people was not true.
I assure you that no innocent people were harmed during this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize that, as does the President... and we will make sure that doesn&#39;t happen in the future,&quot; the Secretary of State was quoted as saying by AFP.
The experts in equestrian events who flock to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award knew that the competition would be fierce.
But no one was prepared for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, having taken his first steps only a few months before, this little one with his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult competitors far behind.
This inseparable couple - the same height - received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Center in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
Stepping out into the public eye against the backdrop of men and women in elegant bowler hats, he tilted his cap and proudly swept the two-year-old Toffee in a circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his precocious natural ability with horses.
And Toffee received the highest marks for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffee for his third birthday last March and has been training the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee make a great duo.&quot;
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigloo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over 10 years.
Ms Howels said: &quot;The entire audience was amazed and everyone cheered and clapped.&quot;
He ran across the sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens that he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will soon be competing in Horse of the Year and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do well.
A spokesman for this annual horse show said: &quot;Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot;
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They evaluate the coherence of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I&#39;m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
A regular bus overturned in Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, a PAZ regular bus overturned.
As a result of the accident, according to updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 am local time on the highway Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and the driver on the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all of them received injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, two people were hospitalized in the Rubtsovsk Central District Hospital.
Court Suspends NYPD Stop-and-Search Enforcement
On Thursday, a federal circuit court of appeals suspended a court order seeking changes to the New York Police Department&#39;s stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that enforcement of Judge Shira Sheindlin&#39;s decisions will be suspended pending the outcome of the city&#39;s appeal.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in the way it implemented a program of street detentions and interrogations.
The city has filed an appeal against her decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a comptroller to help the police department change its practices and associated training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments of the parties on the motion to stay the case.
The Court of Appeals called for the judge&#39;s disqualification because she violated the U.S. code of conduct for judges and did not consider the need to avoid displaying bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements publicly responding to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably reaching out to blacks and Hispanics in a stop-and-frisk program.
It has appointed an external monitor to oversee sweeping changes, which include policy, training and monitoring reforms, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras in police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York came to the decision to stop the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were dropped after a police check.
The city&#39;s appeal debate must take place after March 14, 2014.
The &quot;stop and frisk&quot; tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-and-search has been around for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has skyrocketed under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time high of 684,330 people in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four people, all from national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end bad practices, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and could impact how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale rather than crime rates, waste money, and fail to address the larger problem of difficult police conditions due to a few thousand fewer officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot;, which is constitutional, but changes the way the NYPD stops people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs duties.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
And this will mean that prices should also go down.
&quot;This applies to goods that come from EU countries,&quot; Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should not be a price increase there either.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not entirely true, or, to be more precise, not at all,&quot; Azarov summed up.
Tasmanian Healthcare $325M Rescue Package
The federal government is insisting that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania&#39;s weakened health care system will come with stringent conditions to ensure the state government doesn&#39;t waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanja Pliebersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to avert a crisis caused by the island state&#39;s aging population, higher levels of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The four-year funding decision was made after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
&quot;The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,&quot; Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325M package includes $31M for the Elective Operations Blitz.
An additional 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help close the gap.
There is also money for drop-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston to improve after-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services, and introduce personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“This investment will go towards bringing forward ideas from leading physicians on how best to help Tasmania&#39;s healthcare system,” said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in a regime of strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on how it spends these additional funds.
A three-person panel will be set up to make sure the state delivers services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will do nothing &quot;unless it is followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania&#39;s healthcare system on a more sustainable footing.&quot;
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first approached the prime minister in early May.
“I hope the federal assistance package will make a significant difference in bringing this state&#39;s health care system out of a critical state,” Mr. Wilkie said.
These additional selective procedures will largely offset recent cuts, according to the state government.
But opposition federal health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s announcement represents &quot;an Band-Aid-like solution.&quot;
&quot;The reason we&#39;re here is because the state&#39;s Labor government has ripped $430 million out of the healthcare system,&quot; he told ABC TV.
When the state government is pulling out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is putting in $300 million, you can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent on additional bureaucracy.
Obama Voter&#39;s Cry of Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine laudable efforts.
Obstructionism Can&#39;t Justify Problems With Obama&#39;s Reformed Healthcare Website, Drone Attacks
Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard University.
I&#39;m reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me through the gloom of my second year of medical school and revive my sense of hope.
It&#39;s called The Daring to Win, and it&#39;s a memoir of Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The electoral victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents cherished every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a rude awakening, like being pulled out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, things have really changed.
It was something I couldn&#39;t even imagine.
I give Obama credit for his great and varied accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act, to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, to the abolition of Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell, to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public healthcare options, and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base, among others.
But after countless times siding with the Obama administration in front of colleagues and peers, I&#39;ve run out of explanations to provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing wiretapping of foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the National Security Agency&#39;s collection of data on the private lives of Americans or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government misconduct.
He cannot explain the extrajudicial murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki or the failure to meet public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And lately, he can&#39;t justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don&#39;t know if I should have expected this.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that the leadership could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it?
Clearly, elective office is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newtown massacre.
Yet all the examples I have listed above show that they were largely the administration&#39;s own choice.
And that&#39;s what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, seemingly incapable of deciding on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we&#39;ve been hearing about for such a long time.
However, with Obama&#39;s approval rating dropping below 45% this week, going back to 2008 with this book has become much more difficult.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have vanished.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton dealt Obama a resounding defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a failure analysis meeting, he told his employees that they should get back to normal and stay true to their goal.
“I want us to get back our attractiveness,” he said.
“We have to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Egypt&#39;s first freely elected president is sworn in
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he took the oath of office, becoming the country&#39;s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world&#39;s first freely elected Islamist president and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 black-robed judges in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are aiming for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been a banned organization for most of its 84 years of existence. , which served as a target for tough actions by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, and, in contrast to the presidential pomp of Mubarak&#39;s time, traffic was only briefly stopped to let his convoy through the normally busy road that links the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as the Brothers&#39; uncharismatic &quot;spare tire&quot;, his personal prestige has skyrocketed since his victory and Friday&#39;s speech, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists, but of all those who want to see things through. the 2011 uprisings against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later headed to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army band playing the national anthem, during which he stood at attention.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;The army and the people are one hand&quot;, which was chanted by hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold for Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak&#39;s authoritarian rule last year, began and promised to return the presidential powers that had been stripped from him by a military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before a court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he is following the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature &quot;extracurricular texts&quot; to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English Literature and Language course will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate language final exam, with strong recommendations to choose English Literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is scheduled to release new curricula for English and math tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically overhauled.
He will be making changes to other core subjects next year.
Separate exam regulator OFQUAL will introduce a revised high school GCSE structure, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking over the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was &quot;a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system to regain public confidence&quot;, insisting that school leaving examinations will be &quot;more difficult, more ambitious and more rigorous&quot;.
Research shows that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during a term) than most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students study about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on math in the schedule, coalition sources said that the massive high school GCSEs in math, combined with a higher score on the leaderboard, would likely encourage schools to provide additional teaching in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on &quot;real life problems&quot;, including financial mathematics.
Football - the reason for discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the &quot;Open Tribune&quot;, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game - only scandals and strife.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulyovo and said that in order to reduce the &quot;degree of tension in society,&quot; politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit the birth rate there ...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which made the discussion chaotic.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulyovo were &quot;a model conflict that could have been predicted,&quot; but &quot;too many people and authorities are responsible for these issues,&quot; and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has practiced for a long time in relation to migrants, according to the public figure, has failed, and we must find our own way.
Historian Yury Petrov laid great hopes on the new unified history textbook.
&quot;We also need to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said.
Gennady Zyuganov suggested introducing criminal liability for &quot;calls for the dismemberment of Russia&quot;: &quot;If you say on the radio in the United States that Alaska should be given to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!&quot;
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to inflame.
As usual, he blamed journalists for everything, who bring painful and acute national problems to public discussion: &quot;In the heat of controversy, you never know what can be said!&quot;
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a &quot;charter&quot; and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that makes regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: it does not have &quot;clear ideas about what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
This means that the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no funds, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use ...
The head of the Duma&#39;s Committee on Nationalities, Gadzhimet Safaraliev, proposed the creation of a special department with the formidable name &quot;Ministry of National Security&quot;, which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar agency that was later abolished, spoke out against it.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a &quot;minister without a portfolio&quot; who could be contacted if necessary.
&quot;We are walking along the edge, shells are exploding nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy information support,&quot; said Vsevolod Chaplin, representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for public relations.
In his opinion, there should be no neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: &quot;We still need to look for more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, but they are being pushed onto the wrong path, the wrong road,&quot; he said.
“The wrong road” is the development of football: “Then a football player is beaten by the whole crowd, then flags are burned, then comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we do not need such football?

National Security Agency Confessions Reinforce Corporate Paranoia About Government Surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&#39;s domestic intelligence service, he was assigned to photograph the roof of the US Embassy building, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to find the eavesdropping antennas, and this action prompted talks between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot;
But ever since Edward Snowden - a contract employee turned whistleblower - began to publish his treasure trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director&#39;s word can be trusted.
Reports that the US National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data held by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by government surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If Europe&#39;s most powerful person can be targeted, then of course business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense collaboration between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it&#39;s likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consultancy EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, so far there has been no evidence that the US has passed foreign companies&#39; trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and opined that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
&quot;That&#39;s not an option,&quot; says Gasso Plattner, president of German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and sophistication of US spying agencies made famous by Snowden&#39;s revelations came as a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in the cloud, where European business leaders have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
About 10 percent of non-U.S. members have abandoned plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the US data mining program Prism was exposed, according to research by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association.
Jim Snabe, one of the chief executives of SAP, said: &quot;We see consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction.&quot;
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore this data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
It has always been there.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don&#39;t like to brag about the countermeasures they have taken, as this can give an advantage to the adversary.
Large companies have long adopted the idea that taking a free flash drive at a trade show or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is imprudent to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at automaker Audi, says it&#39;s been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can&#39;t be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to smartphone vulnerabilities.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacks and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in the report.
The US is warning its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence brief in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second tier of economic intelligence hackers after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot;
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;The services are well aware that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.&quot;
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to shooting at one of the terminals.
An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 Moscow time).
Security evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary data, the man fired from a high-powered rifle.
Several people, including a member of the US Transportation Security Administration, were injured.
The police returned fire and arrested the attacker.
He is slightly injured.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Secretary of Labor Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by that state&#39;s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changes to seaside leases at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned stakes in three properties on public land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew leases on Circular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without going through a tender after they expired. in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid&#39;s covert involvement in the properties, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi&#39;s former deputy chief of staff, Lynn Ashpole on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for public tender.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the Circular Key business leases, which brought in about $2.5 million a year to the Obaid family, were renewed without being put up for public tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who Mr. Tripodi acknowledged strongly advised changes to the government&#39;s rental policy.
Telephone transcripts provided to ICAC show conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who joined the Ports Ministry after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
“Was the issue discussed during these phone calls the development of a commercial lease policy?” Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley asked Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied. —
I can&#39;t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn&#39;t that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
UN announces new targets to end poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were set 12 years ago to end poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the &quot;sustainable development goals&quot; to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN&#39;s sustainable development summit kicked off in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit attendees the night before that now is the time to &quot;get above the national interest.&quot;
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals - SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the mandate given to me by member countries to realize our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
A new line of expenses will appear in the utility bills of Voronezh residents - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year, you will have to pay extra from 100 to 400 rubles a month.
The exact standard will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the entrance, put the stairwells in order or even replace the elevator - the residents themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: “In this matter, too, it is necessary to put things in order - to set the order for the overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings.
Equity construction is now under state control.
The law protecting from swindlers is approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born out of nowhere.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers.
Most problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “It is no secret that abuses also began in this area, connected with the fact that in 1998 the same equity holders got into the 2000s, the same equity holders. &quot;
People began to make money on this to cover up the loophole, among other things, they adopted these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center near Voronezh for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
There are more than enough problems with illegal migrants in the region.
So, last year a little more than 100,000 foreigners got registered with migration.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: &quot;They violated the law, but they are not criminals.&quot;
There is no court, but it is necessary to deport them - they must be kept somewhere.
The federation made such a decision that such places should be equipped at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place has been identified - this is Staraya Olshanka, Semiluksky District.
And finally, the regional parliament has endowed parents with many children with new benefits.
Firstly, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but parents with many children save the same amount.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt 3 or more babies will receive subsidies for housing from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, own child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state purchases housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-Western microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can already buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of guidelines for managing food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
Now one in 20 children in the US has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help if an allergic reaction occurs.
It also recommends that schools stock up on epinephrine — most commonly used for injections, the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to stock up on adrenaline with less hassle.
The notice also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have experienced an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is poking my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue tingles.”
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a scary place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” The newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya&#39;s most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said the new media judiciary &quot;will always be partisan as it is an extension of the government&quot; and content and advertising restrictions would hurt Kenya&#39;s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to &quot;take a stranglehold on the media&quot;, while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had &quot;taken a major hit&quot; and criticized the bill as &quot;draconian&quot;.
The passage of the bill is part of measures taken to boost national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at Westgate Mall.
The Kenyan media has drawn the ire of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of the troops that were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly looting an expensive shopping center.
Police Chief David Kimayo&#39;s response was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was canceled after widespread media protests.
Under the new law, publishing houses can be fined up to KSh 20 million and individual journalists up to KSh 1 million, with the additional risk of being “de-listed,” i.e. banned from receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the power to confiscate the violator&#39;s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, &quot;Even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.&quot;
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya&#39;s so-called &quot;busy blogosphere&quot;.
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
“Left to their own devices, politicians will bankrupt the country and return us to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse cuts imposed by the National Pay Commission and reinstate their massive salary of some 532,000 shillings a month tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in the city of Biysk locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
Currently, investigators are elucidating all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten employees.
After being accused of bad taste, Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Yevgenia Vasilyeva, who has been under the close attention of the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - her relationship with ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and addiction to valuables.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the Oboronservis case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: &quot;Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to get out of me any negative information regarding the former defense minister.&quot;
There was blackmail that I had to testify, otherwise they would put me in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure that we will win.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps, most of all, Vasilyeva was hurt by the words that she did not have good taste.
Probably, this refers to the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that fakes were found in the collection of paintings collected by the defendant in the Oboronservis case.
Among the seized property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, the art examination, appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,&quot; Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then, nevertheless, they admitted that they had not been stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just chaos,&quot; says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes imputed to her, Vasilyeva said: “Of course not.
There is nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They&#39;re just misleading people, that&#39;s all.
In addition, in response to today&#39;s statement by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is evading studying the materials of the criminal case, the defendant&#39;s lawyer said that &quot;the investigator does not allow him and his client to get acquainted with the materials of the case.&quot;
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not resist the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she &quot;fell into an even greater trance under house arrest&quot; because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
Well-known military observer &quot;KP&quot; Viktor Baranets in his article &quot;Serdyukov returned to his wife?&quot; wrote: &quot;Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative during interrogations.&quot;
Previously, Vasilyeva took on some of the accusations of the illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game in order to save him before the match of the 4th round of the Champions League group stage with Real Madrid.
Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe will also not take part in the duel with Parma.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from his injury and is ready to play.
The UK government has announced a study to improve the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 rail project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed links to Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Cramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together&quot;.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;thrilled&quot; at the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first Phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has tasked HS2 Ltd with considering further improvements to rail capacity and reduced journey times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include being able to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Cramer said: &quot;Our goal with HS2 is to create a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But we are also talking about the transport connection of cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected with HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; support Scotland&#39;s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: &quot;High-speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland&#39;s economic weight to the overall case for high-speed rail across the UK.&quot;
Therefore, we are delighted to be working in partnership with the UK Government to explore options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with UK ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
US cuts food allowance for the poor
Meal allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the United States has been cutting funding for food stamps, known as &quot;Food Stamps,&quot; as the corresponding government program ends.
Food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less a month than before, officials say.
This will affect the poorest 47 million Americans.
In fiscal year 2012, benefits per person averaged $133 per month, according to Reuters.
Food aid spending in the US has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid, given out under &quot;Food Stamps&quot;, which have been called so since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to boost the economy and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program&#39;s funds, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America worry that the cuts will drive down consumer spending.
US congressmen continue to argue about how to further cut government funding.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been queuing at the border with Russia for almost a week now.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install dry closets
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at the border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about innovations in advance.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Vladimir Denisov, deputy head of the Eastern Customs.
The new document is used in countries that have joined the convention on international transport.
Checkpoints are working in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of &quot;FACTS&quot; visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in a roadside shop-cafe at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are growing every day, as is the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, they were still allowed to enter until midnight, and then these rules were introduced, - complains the truck driver Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who is transporting cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
According to the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance it is being transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who go not far (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars pay somewhere around 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and drive through.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine if a driver is carrying a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow, he needs to pay 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) for transit!
There are no conditions for survival at the border, - truckers who have settled down to eat near their cars complain.
It is always expensive in border shops and cafes, but we have never seen such prices as here!
The sellers got their bearings and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnia is a loaf, seven hryvnia - a glass of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a bowl of soup.
And there is only one cafe.
And there is no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No shower, no shave...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for the road.
I&#39;ll last a week, - another truck driver Viktor Skotarenko consoles himself.
But will the queue reach my car in a week?
How much do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, a crystal bottle or water infused with silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there is something else, - the saleswoman retorts.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosievskaya and Novoazovskaya regional state administrations were instructed to provide everyone who is standing in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said Sergey Dergunov, Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Regional State Administration.
Ambulances are currently on duty at the checkpoints.
Also, for the convenience of people, dry closets will be installed.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 vehicles, respectively, were idle at the international checkpoints Uspenka and Novoazovsk.
&quot;FACTS&quot; will follow the development of the situation.
Sony expects lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, ended the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony&#39;s results for the period from July to September 2013 turned out to be more depressing than expected, which is associated with a drop in demand for televisions, camcorders and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony&#39;s TV business, which posted its first three-year operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter, fell back to an operating loss of 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially due to the decline in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony&#39;s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where the company&#39;s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen in operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of &quot;smart&quot; watches from a Japanese corporation was announced, endowed with a number of fashionable functions that will eliminate the need to get a smartphone out of your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its full-year profit and revenue guidance, the company&#39;s shares lost more than 11% at the opening of trading in Tokyo this morning, dropping to 1,668 yen per share.
How much do late celebrities earn - MK in the USA
Madonna topped the list of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013, earning $125 million.
But she was surpassed by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Noticeably behind him are other deceased celebrities, who last year &quot;earned&quot; several times less.
The second in the list of the most &quot;wealthy&quot; retired celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below Peanuts comics author Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Socialist-Revolutionary proposes to equate insult to patriotic feelings with extremism
For the legislative protection of citizens&#39; patriotic feelings from provocations and insults directed against Russia, A Just Russia proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the Izvestia newspaper, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by Oleg Mikheev, deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy, have already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude towards its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for desecration of the formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions that unfold annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media people allow themselves to question the heroic deed of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Nazis.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds every year.
Practicing wit and an &quot;alternative view&quot; of history, some publicists go so far as to argue that, they say, what a pity that cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main &quot;spiritual bond&quot; of the nation,&quot; Oleg Mikheev is indignant.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are much more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but at the same time, the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the people&#39;s choice, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe the appropriate punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years in prison.
The influence of jailers will increase in the new compositions of public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) may approve new members of public monitoring commissions (POC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, security lobbyists will increase their influence.
PMC - public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the unrest in the Kopeysk colony - it is through the POC that most high-profile incidents behind bars are made public.
There is a struggle between human rights activists and security forces lobbyists for control over the PMC.
At a meeting of the working group of the OP on the formation of the PMC, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities the criterion for selection.
&quot;He was not accepted, and lists were formed without developing criteria,&quot; says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights activists dealing with prison problems.
When he was a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the PMC.
The OP Council must vote for the composition of the PMCs in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants apply for 1,800 vacancies, and competitions could not be organized in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria due to a lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize additional recruitment for vacancies.
The POC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, there are 11 human rights activists and 9 security officials in the current composition of the capital commission, and in the version that is being voted in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to get into the capital&#39;s commission.
But the representative of the &quot;Combat Brotherhood&quot; Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the PMC for three years, but he never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman of the POC, will be able to make the work of human rights activists unbearable, so human rights activists do not rule out a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by POC member Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
&quot;I don&#39;t eat babies for breakfast,&quot; Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights activists from visiting arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list the OP was currently voting for.
He considers the disclosure of information by Borshchev to be a form of pressure.
A possible success for human rights activists is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk PMC.
Its former leaders will be removed because of last year&#39;s Kopeysk unrest.
The Public Chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the PMC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights activists to the security forces.
The human rights activist, chairman of the local commission, “disappeared” from the new lists, but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions &quot;revenge for Kopeysk.&quot;
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the POC of Mordovia, which is considered &quot;powerful&quot;: only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and her documents for the competition were not even accepted.
Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The compilation of the lists of the PMC was coordinated by the deputy secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Hryb told RBC Daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights activists and security officials and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough authority to hinder the work of its members.
The mushroom does not undertake to predict the results of the vote of the Council of the OP.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put up for a vote in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave issue.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining mogul, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made the announcement as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer&#39;s united party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be critical in deciding whether to repeal carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott&#39;s daughters would personally benefit from political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, then he will have a direct interest in whether they get the leave or not,” Mr. Palmer said. .
Two months after the election, the Board of Elections officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Fairfax constituency&#39;s Sunshine Coast seat by a recount margin of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the vote count procedure to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott&#39;s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn&#39;t we have a system where you can come in, enter your data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 18:30 that evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn&#39;t like it?
Using a pencil seems strange these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for e-voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job &quot;very seriously&quot;.
Public office involves serving the community.
“We are not seeking any award other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this county at a critical time,” he said.
Lawsuits filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei under Nortel patents
A group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it outbid in Nortel&#39;s bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel&#39;s patents for $4.5 billion, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords with their respective ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google&#39;s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google&#39;s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel&#39;s patents.
Google raised its bid several times, eventually bidding as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was partly driven by Motorola&#39;s patent library.
“Despite an unsuccessful attempt to purchase at auction the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it alleges that Google&#39;s patent infringement is willful, according to the lawsuit.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, said police officers who were present today at a meeting of the RFU FTC.
The ticket program is overpriced, in their opinion, by about two times.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved, with a regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were supposed to have 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the stadium&#39;s capacity, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
These data were announced by the head of the FTC Artur Grigoryants.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea drilling rig released back into the wild
A bird airlifted to shore after being found emaciated on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed on a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month and then rescued by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Scotland at a rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: &quot;This water shepherd is most likely a northern European winter migrant who has been caught in strong winds over the North Sea.&quot;
It looks like the bird was exhausted and was able to take refuge on the oil rig.
He added: &quot;She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.&quot;
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trading in Vologda will increase significantly
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and stalls.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes; the products they sell often do not pass the appropriate sanitary control.
And this means that the health of Vologda residents is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase six times from November - from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all those laid off received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, the question arises of reducing industrial production in the region.
The deputy of the regional legislature, Aleksey Etmanov, said at the meeting that about 600 people were laid off at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this happened back in September: then, under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to quit of their own free will were offered &quot;golden parachutes&quot; in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don&#39;t think this is the end of the matter.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation in the next two years,&quot; he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
Ford does not deny or confirm this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talk about laying off workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company&#39;s plans to lay off 600 people became known back in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of car production.
The plant cited a drop in demand for Ford cars in Russia as the reason.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad Region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia&#39;s GDP growth rates are insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers Russia&#39;s GDP growth rate insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned this year&#39;s GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
In reality, it will be slightly less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries, it does not seem to be very bad, but this is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done,&quot; the head of government stressed.
Ugra director Andrei Belmach noted that it is still difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so I’m not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, ”ITAR-TASS quotes Belmach as saying.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I would like not just to find some kind of coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
The snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the banknote is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively making fun of the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photobanks.
In particular - in the free photo storage StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial published on the Russian site Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue tones.
On the one hand, a snowboarder is depicted flying over Sochi, on the other, a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding, since this is a relatively young sport.
According to an Izvestia source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public&#39;s opinion regarding the wide distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak they are not too worried about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Natalia Nikiforova, head of the press service of the Gosznak, told Izvestia that all arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, in the photographs on the network - to the left, Nikiforova specified.
The person at the photo shoot to create the banknote was filmed from different angles, then the final image was chosen, on it is the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is positive at all.
Recognition of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichev, Executive Director of NP &quot;RusBrand&quot;.
It is rather difficult to prove the 100% similarity of images on a banknote and in photo banks, so claims to challenge intellectual property for this image are unlikely to be received.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Fashion Week in Sao Paulo.
At home, she is considered not just a fashion model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bundschen left work for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and for this week of the fashion show she came specially.
A months-long absence did not prevent her from maintaining her place on the podium and on the podium.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the fashion show of the Kolchchi brand.
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one organized by stylist Lino Villaventura.
The brand is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of luxury ready-to-wear, the fashion designer is actively working in the theater and in the cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous films.
In total, more than 30 thousand firms and companies related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the ending Sao Paulo Fashion Week.
It is one of the fastest growing industries, with over 2 million Brazilians employed and an annual turnover of up to $50 billion.
Driver fined £1,000 for driving at 130 mph with hot drink between legs
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howey, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a takeaway drink between his legs.
In Colchester Magistrates&#39; Court, Howie pleaded guilty to the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven demerit points to his driver&#39;s license resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howey was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and a £100 surcharge for helping victims of crime.
Belarus raises pensions in November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November of this year, BelTA learned from the main department of pension provision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
From November 1 this year, the average wages of workers in the republic, applied during the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted, with an increase in its value by 5.4%, and a corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be carried out in accordance with decree No. 478 dated October 21, 2013 &quot;On increasing pensions&quot;.
As a result of the recalculation from November, retirement pensions will increase, according to estimates, by an average of 5.3%.
The average retirement pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
Expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with an increase in the subsistence minimum budget per capita.
The BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force for the period from August 1 to October 31.
Accordingly, the size of the minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from November 1.
In Belarus, the payment of pensions, taking into account increases in 2013, has been allocated more than Br53 trillion.-0-
NSA blames &#39;internal error&#39;, not hackers, for site downtime
The shrouded National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers, as the network claimed.
&quot;NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The issue will be resolved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier tonight, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had been down for at least six hours, and the site is still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency&#39;s internal secret network was &quot;far from&quot; hacked.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hacker activists has said they are responsible for bringing down an NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target site with traffic until the servers become overloaded and the site goes down.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system&#39;s internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed &quot;No Such Agency,&quot; has come under public scrutiny in recent months following a string of revelations about its extensive foreign and domestic surveillance programs - all in response to classified NSA files stolen from agencies and published by disillusioned former NSA officer Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked speculation that today&#39;s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Gazprom chief Alexei Miller says Bulgarian pipeline heralds a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today, a milestone event took place: construction began on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia&#39;s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia&#39;s gas destined for Europe, raises the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated &quot;for good&quot;.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline&#39;s route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Agency &quot;Rosbalt&quot; was deprived of the status of the media for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to invalidate the registration license of the Rosbalt agency, writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact, denying the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is &quot;Rosbalt&quot;
CJSC Information Agency Rosbalt was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency&#39;s exclusive publications was (and still is) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talk about the closeness of the publication to law enforcement agencies continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, such assumptions were also supported by the fact that Natalya Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, the role of Chaplina in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: most often she is called the &quot;project manager&quot;.
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation, nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the ranking of Russian media website traffic according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months are notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the lead singer of the King and the Shut group, and pogroms in the capital Biryulyovo.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, prohibiting journalists from using obscene language.
The agency found prohibited vocabulary in two videos published on the agency&#39;s website (&quot;Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;Pussy Riot defiled oil rigs&quot;).
The rest of the story is described differently by the parties.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the discovered video materials, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law and filed a lawsuit demanding that the agency&#39;s license be revoked.
Rosbalt stated that the claims of the department were unlawful: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the swear words in them were disguised, and thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th, the justice of the peace ruled not in favor of Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20,000 rubles - 10,000 rubles for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled to invalidate Rosbalt&#39;s registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (an application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov spoke about the illegality of closing the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the matter would not come to revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today is a big question.
Speech gene turns out to stimulate synapse formation
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that makes the Foxp2 &quot;speech gene&quot; work by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, on the journal&#39;s website you can read its summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
It was possible to establish his role in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted in family members, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least part of its function as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in a region of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
He does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, while Foxp2 affects its activity only.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect vocalization was confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the gene activity was artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of emitted sounds was also restored.
An association with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself has also been shown previously in mice.
Animals injected with a human copy of the gene squeaked more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, SRPX2 controlled by it, is connected with purely &quot;mechanical&quot; properties of sound production or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left the &quot;Fair Russia&quot;
State Duma deputy from the Just Russia party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted an application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the &quot;right Russians&quot;.
We sit and drink tea...
“For some reason, many people want to see the picture “Ilya Ponomarev puts his party card on the table,” but there is nothing so epoch-making in this,” the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse the mandate of the State Duma deputy.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and, by law, cannot leave it.
Messages about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the Just Russia party appeared on October 30th.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the &quot;SR&quot; together with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Want some glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world&#39;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop a glowing food.
He came up with the idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream glows when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lick Me I&#39;m Delicious, says: &quot;It&#39;s an incredible thing, but it&#39;s still in its infancy when it comes to production, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of stuff.&quot;
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We&#39;ve been testing it for the past few months and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it on Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is possibly the most expensive ice cream I&#39;ve ever made because jellyfish luminescence is four times the price of gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
However, it tastes pretty good.
Based in Bristol, Charlie&#39;s Experimental Company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, &quot;I really want to develop invisible ice cream.&quot;
This is by definition impossible due to the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we&#39;ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM is recalling a number of new pickup trucks in the US for seatback rework
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address issues with manual seatback reclining, pursuant to a notice from US motor vehicle safety regulators introduced Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest tilt mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal motor vehicle safety head restraint standards.
“In the event of a rear impact, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” according to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM&#39;s pickup truck launch began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the leading American automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM informed pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to review the notice to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that dampened growth in car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 lineup, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
Shares of GM on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose 1.4 percent to $37.47.
A pedestrian zone was opened near the Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometer section from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square.
Street lamps, florists, benches, trash cans and toilets have been installed throughout, blank fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - Ordynsky dead end, Bolshoi and Maly Tolmachevsky lanes, Kadashevsky embankment and Bolotnaya square.
Traffic on Maroseyka and Petrovka streets is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the lobby of the Novokuznetskaya station to Klimentovsky Lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without stopping traffic and cutting the roadway, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Martyr Clement Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tverskoy proezd, Stoleshnikov lane and Kuznetsky Most street became completely pedestrian.
Bolshaya Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was decided to be closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Fans of &quot;Zenith&quot; on the club&#39;s official website recognized the ex-captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.
In October, Arshavin took part in two matches of the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, three meetings of the Russian championship and in the cup match.
He has 2 assists to his credit.
Second place at the end of the month went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player in August and September.
In third position is the attacking Hulk.
The Brazilian has two goals and three assists.
Recall that Arshavin returned to Zenit this summer.
A series of premiere film screenings &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings &quot;Art Mainstream&quot;, where viewers can watch one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Rolan cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program of &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be opened by the French comedy &quot;Paris at any cost&quot; directed by and actress Reim Kerichi.
This is a story about a model Maya (Kerici herself) working in the French capital, who, due to problems with a visa, is deported to her homeland - to Morocco.
In addition to Kerichi&#39;s film, the audience will also be shown a new film by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk &quot;Moebius&quot;, a melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirschbiegel &quot;Diana: a love story&quot; (Diana) starring Naomi Watts and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival held in May &quot;Adele&#39;s Life&quot; by Abdelatif Keshisha.
The only Russian participant in the &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be Alexander Veledinsky&#39;s &quot;The Geographer Drank His Globe Away&quot; film, which won at the Kinotavr festival, based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - was played in the film by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the Kinotavr prize.
Snowden ready to &#39;cooperate&#39; with Germany on US intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, on Thursday to discuss his testimony in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection.” .
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes the support of the international community can convince the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
Charges filed by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany&#39;s interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.&quot;
Relations between the US and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who chairs the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness &quot;without endangering him and completely destroying relations with the US,&quot; it should be seized.
Mr Ströbele, an MP from the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to a lawyer for the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a &quot;tough and persistent&quot; campaign of harassment that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the worldwide reaction to &quot;his political statements&quot;.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials - including in the United States - found the exposure of an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance beneficial to society.
The letter contains an offer to cooperate with the German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.&quot;
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas may be tested for &quot;authenticity&quot;
An &quot;identity&quot; test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it plans to expand crackdowns.
This test, if passed, would apply under criteria designed to prevent Class 457 visas from being used to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The government&#39;s discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKue criticized the government&#39;s rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&#39;s neighbors.
“The &#39;Foreigners back of the line&#39; and &#39;Australians work first&#39; rants represent a very nasty throwback to the days when unions demanded a secure labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he is meeting with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria for &quot;authenticity&quot; are adopted, the visa applicant could be examined as to whether &quot;the candidacy is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise&quot;.
Businesses may also be required to report the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as previously businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died, believed to be of a heart attack, after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man&#39;s heartbroken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his journey to Australia, and since his father&#39;s death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
The head coach of “Colorado” Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in the Friday match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas correspondent “SE” Natalia Shmeleva.
And what can we expect, - said Rua after the morning rolling &quot;Lavigne&quot;.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go on the ice today.
We want him to go on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the goalkeeper&#39;s condition in any way?
We&#39;ll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him protect the goal, as was the case in previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court sorts out this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali
The current board of directors of OAO Uralkali proposed the candidacy of the general director Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, to the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, which will determine the new composition of the board of directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of power.
However, later, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that the accusations against Baumgertner had been reclassified as &quot;embezzlement.&quot;
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are under way with the IMF for a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that their goal is to conclude an agreement as soon as possible.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of financing.
Nor does the international rating agency S&amp;P, which on Friday downgraded Ukraine&#39;s sovereign rating by one notch to &quot;B-&quot; from &quot;B&quot;, do not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive assistance.
However, EU officials say the IMF could be flexible on lending terms, given Ukraine&#39;s circumstances.
In addition to the country&#39;s financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia &quot;isolates&quot; Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
&quot;Negotiations are underway between the EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources than Russia, or from the same source, but through other routes,&quot; the source added to Reuters.
&quot;Dynamo&quot; organizes for fans a free train to Khimki for the match with &quot;Tom&quot;

Recall that the match &quot;Dynamo&quot; - &quot;Tom&quot; will begin on November 2 at 16.00 Moscow time.
Sovsport.ru will broadcast it in text.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during takeoff and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, the BBC reports.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout their flight, with the new rules coming into effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connection to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometers.
Due to the risk of interference from aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers on flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobiles on aircraft equipment and aircraft controls.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, Britain may also be reviewing the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
Run out on the field in the match &quot;Shinnik&quot;
Became known some details about the identity of the fan who ran onto the field during the match 1 / 16 finals of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl &quot;Shinnik&quot; and Moscow &quot;Spartak&quot;.
According to the head of the FCC RFU Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently under arrest.
“In addition, Grigoryants spoke about how the fan managed to break into the field: “It turned out that this one, let&#39;s call him a spectator, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed away the two escorts and ran towards the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North stands.
He ran across the field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the area of \u200b\u200baction of the stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the East Stand.
And at that time, riots began on the East Stand and on the treadmills,&quot; the head of the FTC said.
Let us recall that by the decision of the FTC, Spartak Moscow will play the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian Championship without spectators against Lokomotiv and Zenit, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Arshavin&#39;s ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov
The ex-civil wife of the football player of St. Petersburg &quot;Zenith&quot; Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends a vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiancé - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Pictures from joint walks of couples are published on Instagram by Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrei and Yulia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a picture in which the couple stands embracing on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit midfielder Andrey Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his common-law wife Yulia.
Recall that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
Arshavin&#39;s new girlfriend was married to a top manager of a corporation.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate ministry of construction and housing and communal services
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry in charge of construction and housing and communal services and offered to head it to the ex-governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu during a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men, the son of the famous Orthodox priest Archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Gubkin Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry.

From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Americans eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the American intelligence services, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the States were eavesdropping on telephone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that there are several listening points in the Land of the Rising Sun.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
None of the parties has yet commented on this information officially.
Recall that the news about the surveillance of the US secret services for the German chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have tapped Merkel&#39;s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that allies, which, in her opinion, have been Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel&#39;s telephone conversations with employees of the German prosecutor&#39;s office.
The German flew to Moscow specifically to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video hit the police
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The police of the Canadian city said that they have the relevant video and are ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said that he would not leave his post, according to CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford&#39;s drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference about this.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these frames with the public, but he vouched for their existence.
According to Blair, the video compromising Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press has already written about the existence of this video, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this matter.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video footage recovered by police is one piece of evidence in the case of Ford&#39;s 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of drug dealing, extortion, illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi acted as a driver for Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to mess around with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their education, but also entertains them as best she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook, which shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday she pampered the fans by showing how she dressed up Artyom and Martha for Halloween.
Ready for broom racing! our first halloween&quot; - this is how Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The source of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the website of the US Geological Survey (USGS).
The aftershocks were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 Moscow time).
No casualties or damage caused by the tremors have yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active regions of the Earth, so earthquakes of various strengths are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious happened in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960, a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
JSC &quot;Rostovaeroinvest&quot; recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the tender, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and beautification elements of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters. m, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the results of the tender were summed up, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny air terminal complex was determined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The design of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in implementing large projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new air terminal complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The Yuzhny international airport complex will be built in the Aksai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and integrated into urban development in the future.
The start of construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.
Experienced Italian workers make way for younger ones
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country&#39;s residents are now out of work.
Things haven&#39;t been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for long-term workers.
However, on the other hand, Italy faces the common European problem of an aging population.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all of its declared chemical weapons production capacity, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
Damascus completed this first stage of disarmament a day before the deadline.
Before November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of chemical warfare agents for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and reloading ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors on new sites to check if there is any reason to suspect that Damascus is not completely outspoken.
The US believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached through the mediation of Russia - to destroy or disable all facilities for the production of shells, poison gases and liquids and for filling shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been passed, the next step should be to destroy the Syrian army&#39;s existing chemical weapons.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, blister mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable of action - two weeks are allotted for this.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of equipment.&quot;
&quot;They don&#39;t have the capacity to continue producing or blending chemical weapons now,&quot; he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the factories for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
Smith said the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was &quot;particularly challenging&quot; because of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the inspectors have not yet found time to celebrate this - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: Break with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
It&#39;s time for stories about passport control at Berwick and the barbed-wire border along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
It is true that Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement throughout the rest of Europe, although - predictably - this did not make headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time twisting their formal rules to their advantage.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it&#39;s not a worthy story.
And so old that it has turned into a fossil: the first time I heard the “duck” that “independence means passport control” was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting point lost in the retelling of the old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland take orders from Europe at all?
Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here&#39;s the real European news: The great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally stalled.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as the single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded just this year - came out of nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (an analogue of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag. .
There has always been internal opposition to the plan for a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the retention of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are operating with excessive budget deficits - this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the eurosystem has blocked its members from exchange rates favorable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a disadvantage in terms of production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only saving grace is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper problem with Europe&#39;s productive capacity.
As a result of Brussels&#39; green energy package - a cipher for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
These are paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No amount of global wage freezes will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France&#39;s shattered economy in distress.
The result is that Marine Le Pen&#39;s right-wing, anti-EU National Front party has just won a decisive by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote, a timely warning to British Labor not to assume that a split on the right will automatically ripple in favor of the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use next year&#39;s EU elections to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, as is very likely, anti-EU parties gain support in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing anti-EU and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of the vague &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot; that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
My guess is that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific points to the possibility that the UK will be left behind in the cold of the Atlantic.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region of (essentially) Little Anglia.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can do well under a looser European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, garnering an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labor Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and resulting subsequently a coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence now, only to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian woman files appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket jail for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver filed an appeal and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false complaint after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday June 10 while two other men held her down.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Prior to her trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a general security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, not in an adult women&#39;s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who approached the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for their daughter&#39;s well-being and were looking forward to her return to Australia.
“Obviously it has been a worrying time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to restore its damaged tourism image, leading to an acquittal.

We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.

On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two gambling halls.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Vzlyotnaya Street.
At the time of the check, a game was going on in the institution.
The club counted 24 machines.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been drawn up under the article &quot;Illegal organization and conduct of gambling.&quot;
The equipment was seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver&#39;s license
Driver&#39;s license exams can be taken by private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
Kommersant writes about this with reference to the draft government decree &quot;On admission to driving vehicles.&quot;
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
It is assumed that the students of such &quot;privileged&quot; driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State traffic inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that students do not pass more than 30% of theory exams and more than 20% of the site on the first try, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft government decree come into force on November 5, 2014.
The draft also contains requirements for learning to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
Starting January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass an exam in urban traffic in order to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, studies show.
Physical changes don&#39;t mean puberty is near
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to develop breast buds and pubic hair at age 7 or 8?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics&#39; annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American girls and represent the new normal.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents — it usually doesn’t mean going full puberty quickly,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, and body odor appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5, down from 12.75 in 1970.
&quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it&#39;s at least two to three years before menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: How to Cope with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;premature&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in height before 8 years of age.
In most cases, the process will slow down or pause - this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may warrant testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and short stature in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child&#39;s age, developmental level, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is wary of medication, but admits that &quot;puberty suppression can mitigate behavioral problems and girls&#39; feelings of being different from their peers.&quot;
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don&#39;t want their very young daughters to menstruate.
&quot;They&#39;re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they&#39;ll handle hygiene issues,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many publicized theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, experience puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that carries the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped lead a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that links body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, everything from economic conditions and climate to genes seems to influence early puberty.
Another mystery: although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other clinicians attending the AAP conference have confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and toddlers.
&quot;We have to be careful about how we define true puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier-than-expected conversation,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need reassurance that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the anthem of the Kuban
A football match between Anji and Kuban turned into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, suggested that republican parliamentarians go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly smacks of calls for interethnic hatred, in particular, it calls for war with &quot;basurmans.&quot;
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, in our time in 1995 this anthem was approved.
It&#39;s a shame and no one does it.
&quot;Here we remember you as a mother, we are going to fight to the death against the enemy, against the infidel&quot; - why write such words into the anthem, poison some believers against other believers, &quot;Khizri Shikhsaidov, chairman of the parliament, expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
RBS Suspends Two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its FX division, according to two people familiar with the matter, in further confirmation that global regulator scrutiny of alleged FX manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world&#39;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world&#39;s largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an unfolding investigation that echoes the LIBOR manipulation scandal.
While declining to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it has received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, insiders said that RBS turned over email and instant message records received and sent by its former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, retired from RBS in 2010 and is understood to have been granted a leave of absence from his current position as head of European spot FX trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, retired this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Asher&#39;s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.
Bank UBS said this week that it took action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are considering allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal reviews or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the matter said.
Banks review instant messages and emails for several years looking for cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the checks has galvanized traders in what has been one of the largest sources of income for investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has struggled this year as low currency volatility reduces opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to play down the severity of the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
Despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of their internal platforms by banks means that “you can start to influence the market at very little cost,” according to a senior trader.
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders in its London Stock Exchange trading department this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama&#39;s health care bill
The US Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama&#39;s landmark health care bill is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate regulations under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government&#39;s taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of that 2,700-page law and further held that the health care law&#39;s requirement that states increase Medicaid compliance or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
A lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.

&quot;Russian March&quot; becomes more popular
On November 4, on the Day of National Unity, the &quot;Russian March&quot; coordinated with the mayor&#39;s office will be held in Moscow.
According to a survey by the Levada Center, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens, to varying degrees, approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens approve the holding of &quot;Russian marches&quot; to varying degrees: 11% of them are definitely positive about such actions and 29% are &quot;rather positive.&quot;
The popularity of the idea of &quot;Russian Marches&quot; is gradually growing - in 2006, only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010, twice as many citizens (28%) supported holding such events.
Only 7% of Russians have a &quot;definitely negative&quot; attitude towards the Russian Marches, while 19% have a &quot;rather negative&quot; attitude.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude towards this action.

This action of nationalists has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists, &quot;Have you heard that on November 4, Russian Marches are held in Russia under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?&quot; three-quarters (75%) of the citizens answered in the negative.
Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the &quot;Russian Marches&quot;.
Recall that three years ago on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which turned into riots.
Levada Center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4th.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the Day of the October Revolution on November 7th.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow Mayor&#39;s Office approved the &quot;Russian March&quot; in Lublino
On October 28, the city authorities agreed to hold the &quot;Russian March&quot; on November 4 in Lyublino.

Natives of Chechnya arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March this year.

Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economics Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information cited by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing prices for food and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of a black currency market.
This spring, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that US spying has &quot;gone inappropriately far&quot;
John Kerry demonstrated the softening of US surveillance tactics by making the unprecedented admission that, in some cases, US spying has &quot;gone inappropriately far.&quot;
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being &quot;on autopilot&quot; at the time of Edward Snowden&#39;s high-profile revelations about NSA espionage activities.
These leaks have placed the US government at the center of a diplomatic row with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on autopilot, because this possibility already existed - and during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 9/11.”
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone inappropriately far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted in good faith and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, blowing up buildings and killing people because we were able to know about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve alleged US spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the US, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to withdraw from anti-terrorist organizations out of frustration with NSA surveillance.
&quot;It&#39;s really important to US national security interests that the Europeans remain our supporters of our common counterterrorism efforts,&quot; said first-term Democrat Murphy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden showing that the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office is organizing a congressional trip expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating lawmakers are to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the trip program is still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip is to promote better relations, he said that some degree of &quot;well-meaning toughness&quot; would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what kind of spyware they themselves have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address hostility to US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
In the US, a school principal fired on teenagers.
The directors of one of the American high schools were literally driven to despair by teenagers.
The man, according to him, was forced to take a weapon and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at the man&#39;s house.
Because of this, the director of the school opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm.
Since the bullies were not on the director&#39;s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on $125,000 bail.
Note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the US state of California right at passers-by on the street.
After that, the offender took hostage two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of a car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was opened.
Adam&#39;s mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at an American school: a 14-year-old girl was injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta (Georgia).
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
Chinese newspaper that published call &#39;subject to reorganization&#39;
A Chinese newspaper that published a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of slander must be reorganized, according to the press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a surprise public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he accepted bribes to write false articles about a state-owned company.
New Express must now go through a &quot;full error correction process,&quot; according to the regulator.
The order to &quot;correct errors&quot; came from the Guangdong Office of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned New Express published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of Novy Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He says that a decision has been made to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his reporter&#39;s license.&quot;
He also &quot;instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a full correction of errors in the New Express, and recommended that it investigate the paper&#39;s responsible persons involved in the situation and immediately change the management of the New Express.&quot;
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper ran two front-page calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen&#39;s confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of extracting confessions in China is still rampant, despite recent law amendments that prohibit authorities from forcing someone to incriminate themselves.
Due to the rampage of evil spirits, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the fact that students were attacked by ... goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The story about goblins may sound like a child&#39;s fiction to a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing a school.
Adults are also afraid of evil spirits.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, a hospital was closed due to the fact that goblins also attacked the medical staff.

The pup was lucky enough to escape after fire brigades were called in to pick him up and take him to safety after he somehow got stuck 50 feet up on a dangerous ledge of a sheer slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being in a car accident Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after she ran into a quarry after a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dog breeder spotted Ruby stuck 50 feet up on a ledge in a quarry.
A tech rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene, rappelled down to rescue Ruby, and used a carrier to carry her up the slope.
Rescue Specialist Officer Andy Clayton said: &quot;She was in a dangerous position.&quot;
She was right in the middle of a sheer slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn&#39;t move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she&#39;s fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue Specialist Officer Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.&quot;
There was a possibility that she could get very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup and was found to be fine except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;Watching the rescue was terrifying.&quot;
I couldn&#39;t believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she had become exhausted and passed out, she would most likely have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave what they did.
We are so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson of Keatley added: &quot;We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.&quot;
The firemen were amazing.
I just can&#39;t believe she&#39;s there.
Think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
At Flight Center, the trend seems to be reversed.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and expects record holiday revenues in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its core full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 12-17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Center posted an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with strong numbers, especially in non-business travel in Australia and the UK.
“We have been operating profitably across our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and some of them are set to record full-year earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Center&#39;s leisure business did well, while corporate clients spent less.
Its US business has offset losses incurred during a seasonally weak first half and is expected to post a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Center shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the department reports.
According to Taimar Peterkop, Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our experts quickly adjusted everything, by now the site has been restored.
&quot;The damage caused to the ministry is minimal,&quot; Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
&quot;We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,&quot; he admitted.
Recall that on November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted an appeal online, in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be anyone&#39;s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
&quot;Hands off Ukraine,&quot; Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced that the company of the marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines would take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Japan to discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
&quot;We would like to frankly exchange views on issues of further development of the political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty,&quot; Kishida said at the meeting.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan halfway in resolving complex political issues, RIA Novosti writes.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of land lost after the Second World War to the country.
Cars drive around the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker hears: &quot;Return the northern territories!&quot;.
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and put on a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I look more like a curmudgeon.
I haven&#39;t volunteered for the past two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I probably won&#39;t this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will cost $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, sexual inanimate objects are at the height of fashion.
Women no longer have to be in the sex profession; they can also be sexual foods, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we&#39;ll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I&#39;m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we weren&#39;t the only ones.
What&#39;s more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means lots of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don&#39;t skimp.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That&#39;s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, hard candies, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.
According to the US Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-demanding kids who are poised to take over our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and - let&#39;s not kid ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don&#39;t want to consume is candy in the form of corn kernels; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, almost 35 million pounds of them are sold around Halloween.
That&#39;s about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing captures the essence of Halloween like a haunted house.
They have amazing titles like Horror Behind the Walls (which is in a real prison, by the way), Howl and Scream, and House of Shock.
Moreover, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $ 500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos of you almost peed that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can’t remove it, eh then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like &quot;great expression&quot;.
And finally, let&#39;s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a Jack O&#39;Lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we&#39;ve been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the baby pumpkin trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year, according to the US Census Bureau.
The Jack O&#39;Lantern slowly drying on your porch probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you&#39;re looking for a challenge, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and try carving their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Bayern Munich defender David Alaba has been named the best Austrian athlete in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
Alpine skier Marcel Hirscher came second and ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer third.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
In Kineshma and the region, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged men had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1:00 am, in the village of Lugovoe, at the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11:50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs &quot;Kineshma&quot; reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn&#39;t flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star revealed that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger&#39;s 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and noted, &quot;He flirted with me when I was 18.&quot;
She added, &quot;It was a long time ago and he was very kind.&quot;
In a statement on Thursday, a rep for the 70-year-old Jagger said he &quot;categorically denies he ever hit on Katy Perry.&quot;
The rep added, &quot;Maybe she&#39;s confusing him with someone else.&quot;
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
US-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel discovered, equipped with its own railway
Found one of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The US authorities have described this four-foot-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to sneak drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were surreptitiously smuggled through, authorities said.
Law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine upon discovery of the tunnel, according to court documents.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intent to distribute.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels have been unearthed in Central Mexico since the marijuana harvest in October, which presented drug cartels with the daunting task of getting their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found an approximately 700-yard walkway equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in &#39;ridiculous accident&#39; believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school&#39;s gymnasium believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 with an upright mat leaning back against the bleachers in his high school&#39;s gym.
Investigators from the Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Department have concluded that Johnson died by a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old&#39;s family disputes this.
&quot;They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,&quot; Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
&quot;They think it&#39;s against logic, against the laws of physics, and also against common sense,&quot; Crump said.
They think it&#39;s a front to protect the person or people responsible for their son&#39;s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
US attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
&quot;I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds&quot; for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia&quot;.
However, a second autopsy, according to Moore, showed a different cause of death.
“There are several issues that should be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence to warrant a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Department was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance footage that investigators viewed.
The teen&#39;s parents said they hope the videos hold clues to how he died.
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Prime Minister of Pakistan made a statement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of relations between Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
&quot;The Prime Minister said dialogue with the Taliban has begun,&quot; the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
&quot;He said he hopes and prays for the dialogue to work in accordance with Pakistan&#39;s constitution,&quot; the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country, bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad made attempts to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities would withdraw troops stationed in areas where the Taliban operate to their places of permanent deployment, and also release arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Pakistani Prime Minister and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Goalkeeper “Neftekhimik” Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor Nizhnekamsk.
The goalkeeper believes that acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great prestige among the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall that today “Neftekhimik” dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - RIA Novosti quotes Dalton.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations assigned to him - I have no doubt about that.
He enjoys great authority in the team, this young specialist definitely has a great future ahead of him.
Pawn shop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling
At a pawnshop in Singapore&#39;s Bendemir Mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter&#39;s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family&#39;s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its deal, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A jewelry-backed loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in Ms. Amirthalinga&#39;s case), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered at a branch of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can make loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressure from rising living costs and rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of solid growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in the advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to offset declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, a ratings agency, cited an increase in family leverage, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and bottom [of the income scale] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the rush for people to pawn their personal belongings as they seize the opportunity to cash in on their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pawned in the city-state&#39;s 200 pawn shops are gold items.
People say, &quot;The price of gold looks good, let&#39;s pawn grandma&#39;s gold chain and get it back next month.&quot;
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen a rise in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, chief executive of ValueMax. .
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week from a public offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have drawn fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also doesn&#39;t increase debt directly.
“Clients are pledging items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
Mortgages are gaining more and more public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And at the same time, not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation use pawnshops.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can yield up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include high net worth individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria may put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of state procurement interventions, can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the Minister of Agriculture of the republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there is demand.
&quot;Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year,&quot; he said at yesterday&#39;s press conference.
The minister recalled that this year crops under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were sown for the harvest of 2014 (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The areas under winter wheat and triticale have been increased, rye has remained at the same level.
In the Voronezh region, a football fan was detained for breaking a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o&#39;clock in the evening on October 29, at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed two football fans from the passenger train - natives of the Moscow region.
Having gone to the game of their favorite team, the guys staged a drunken brawl on the train along the way.
The young people were taken to the duty unit of the linear police department at the Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offense.
There, the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued an administrative file on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
At half past one in the night, the fans left the building of the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old guy, unexpectedly returned and kicked the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
An employee of the transport police and a security guard of the private security company &quot;Russian Railways&quot; rushed to the sound of breaking glass.
They managed to detain the attacker, who was trying to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are checking.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being discussed, said Sergey Olkhovik, senior referent for information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Russian security officials do not know anything about the Fraternal Circle group - Novye Izvestia
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
&quot;After the media reported that the US Treasury Department put Leps on the watch list on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate &#39;Brotherly Circle&#39;, we looked through all the databases, but did not find such a grouping,&quot; the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As NI wrote earlier, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the Fraternal Circle criminal group.
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as &quot;Grisha&quot;, posted the day before.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian artist.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five more people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
The United States is sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
Attached to this message is a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The department noted that they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps&#39; assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: &quot;It is difficult to answer the question of whether this is Grigory, whom everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States.&quot;
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I don’t know if they happen in such cases.
&quot;And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected,&quot; she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury Department, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Do you have a black box in your car?
As American road planners scramble to raise money to fix the crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in the little black box tucked neatly into your car&#39;s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and relay that information to officials, are at the center of a controversial effort by Washington and state planners to modernize America&#39;s outdated highway funding system.
The normally dull arena of highway planning has unexpectedly generated intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use little boxes to keep track of how many miles you drive, and perhaps even where you drive them, and then use that information when compiling tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not an issue where we can have a choice,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Association of Southern California Governments, which is preparing plans for the state to begin tracking the miles driven by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for this already exists.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government&#39;s Highway Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn&#39;t been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gas prices.
&quot;The gas tax just can&#39;t be saved,&quot; said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the mileage system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
The nerds call it a pardon user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, as taxes could change the way you travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are eyeing the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state&#39;s ambitious climate change laws.
However, Rep. Bill Schuster (R-PA), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free marketers at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay by the mile.
“This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former US Transportation Secretaries who, in 2011, called on Congress to move in the direction of mileage pay.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would involve about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal due to concerns from rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or the city.
Several states and cities, however, are pursuing this path on their own.
Enthusiasm is strongest in Oregon, which is recruiting 5,000 drivers to participate in the nation&#39;s largest pilot.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for driving miles instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, a pilot project has already been completed.
In New York it is considered.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments from 17 east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received general acceptance.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently fitted with the devices, drivers were concerned that the government might track their every move.
&quot;Concerns about &#39;big brother&#39; and things like that are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn&#39;t what people wanted.
As the tests were under way, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website, &quot;It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.&quot;
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states in the arduous search for low-cost technology that would allow state officials to keep track of miles driven by a car, but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology led some agencies in the state to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in assisting in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market for a form of auto insurance in which drivers pay based on mileage.
But the devices she&#39;s testing appeal to road planners because they don&#39;t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded via modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may choose to forego the device altogether, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public by making devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transit officials are aiming to develop a taxing device that would also accept parking meter payments, provide &quot;pay as you go&quot; insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be attracted to participate by the benefit that is offered to them,” the urban design document says.
Some transportation system designers, however, are wondering if all the talk of mileage is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the failure of the Highway Trust by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles don&#39;t use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the law and public relations commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a host of other things.
Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will ordain new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately be involved in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors&quot;.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as a consistory, would be held prior to the ordination ceremony.
&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,&quot; Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said that usually the pope names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Next year&#39;s consistory will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by an insignificant number of cardinals.
They will also be the first chosen cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, dad decided everything on his own.
“Francis has now chosen eight cardinals to assist him,” Valero said.
He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would look to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in such a situation before - all this is a first for us.
Valero said that popes usually made cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis &quot;is full of surprises - so we don&#39;t know who he will name.&quot;

A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has completed a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% stamp duty on homes over £2m and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in a partnership, and not as individuals.
At £708 million in 2012/13, residential property stamp duty in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber combined taken.
Mr. Cook said: &quot;With the increase in the state duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of high-value real estate is understated, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.&quot;
“But this move could result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
Prime property values - the top 5-10% of the housing market by value - in London&#39;s affluent southwest belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon have risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London continued to post a solid 5.6% year-on-year growth, according to Savills research, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” with price surges in the South West, North (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsk Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric-welded steel pipes was held.
According to Denis Gribanov, commercial director of the enterprise, in 2011, with the advent of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the sales market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric-welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of a pipe, which is used for a heating economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, when purchasing new equipment, it is planned to increase the staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit for slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the production managers, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
Forms of state support for industry are also aimed at this, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidizing agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
The next year&#39;s budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are being reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the tax on mineral extraction, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this, and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the regional government considers it a priority to directly support industrial enterprises, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many heads of enterprises expressed concern over the current situation in relations with the oil industry.
The subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete in price with central Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP, the Rosneft company, which has not yet placed its orders with Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
At present, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The question remains open whether taxes from the oil produced in the Uvat region will go to the regional budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The 2nd Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no disagreements and disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding,” says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theatre.
An exhibition of national-cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Syria destroys its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, watchdog says
Syria has destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring team said Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities believed to be storing toxic substances.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country&#39;s civil war almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The November 1 deadline set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed into poison gas and filled with munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus&#39;s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came during heavy fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facility, according to the UK-based Syrian Advocacy Center for Human Rights.
An activist group that tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a July 25 UN estimate, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad&#39;s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific figures.
The fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, spurred on by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all of Syria&#39;s declared critical production and blending/fueling equipment.&quot;
She added that &quot;no additional inspection activities are currently planned.&quot;
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two sites due to security concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program located there have been moved to other claimed sites that have been verified.&quot;
It was not immediately clear whether the site at Safira was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW&#39;s executive committee.
“I applaud the courage and bravery that you all have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Üzümcü, director general of the watchdog group, said in a comment released by the OPCW.
For the third year now, the civil war has pitted mostly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam.
As for other developments, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the center, said there was a massive explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria&#39;s coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Message: Obama campaign considered excluding Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama&#39;s closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most sensational of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&#39;s much anticipated book on the 2012 campaign, The Stakes Doubled: The Game Changed 2012.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president&#39;s closest aides conducted &quot;large-scale focus group studies and opinion polls in late 2011&quot; to assess whether Biden&#39;s expulsion could help raise waning re-election hopes. Obama.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book details an attempt by senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daly, to assess the effect on the vote of appointing former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret in the Chicago campaign and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president&#39;s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouff — knew a replacement was being considered.
The book Doubled the Stakes claims that Daly initiated the effort to replace Biden despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; but ultimately backed out of the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral ticket would not &quot;materially improve Obama&#39;s chances.&quot; &quot;.
In an interview with Martin, Daly confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I was actively in favor of looking at a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that at that moment the president was in terrible shape, so we were like, “Oh my God, what should we do?”
While Daly described the study as &quot;necessary validation,&quot; Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested heavily in examining whether the move would pay dividends on the ballot.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t spend that much money on polls and focus groups unless they&#39;re seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AK 360.
It&#39;s unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking into a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly if his then-boss was aware of the possible shuffling.
While Daly said he didn&#39;t think the president &quot;was aware&quot; of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff acknowledged that &quot;maybe&quot; Obama did.
Martin added that &quot;The Stakes Are Doubled&quot; does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether political soundings made it to the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn&#39;t know about the study to remove Biden from the ticket.
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Martin replied.
The head of the RFU Control and Disciplinary Committee, Artur Grigoryants, said that Kuban had been fined 500,000 rubles, according to SE correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for setting fire to the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during a home match of the 14th round against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, people from the Premier League.
We have researched all available materials.
For the inappropriate behavior of the audience, “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is unfortunate for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute &quot;Consumer Goods in Russia&quot;, which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, since in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and circulation of beer, a drink with a low alcohol content, Sheps told the audience.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical bans, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many of the legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks, introduced this year, has hit beer producers the hardest.
&quot;We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,&quot; said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two forecasts for the next year.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps spoke about: sales of the foamy drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - they will fall another 2-3 percent.
In order to maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from varieties designed for the mass consumer to the premium class: there will be less beer, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level,” said narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who are &quot;hooked&quot; on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like &quot;Jaguar&quot;, has grown, while ten years ago it was &quot;beer&quot; alcoholism that prevailed.
What will the construction of the transport hub in Moscow lead to
Every year, the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport interchange hubs (TPU).
Until 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 transport hubs.
What the project actually turns into, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the Smolenskaya metro station on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the arrangement of the transport hub was underway.
All this was very strange, since no land transport stops near Smolenskaya and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now at &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; almost everything is finished.
The flower stall disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by paving stones.
That&#39;s the whole transport hub.
Transport interchange hubs are planar and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital&#39;s Department of Transport.
There are no capital transport hubs yet.
And planar ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of retail facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, planar transport hubs are not even dealt with by transport workers, but by professional landscapers from the Department of Capital Repairs of the city of Moscow.
A transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a scoreboard announcing the time of arrival of the transport is enough.
For example, a completely full-fledged plane transfer hub was recently opened near the Yasenevo metro station.
Even without sheds, but with intercepting parking lots and scoreboards indicating when the bus will come.
But in pursuit of quantity, officials write everything down to TPU.
Back in 2011, the mayor&#39;s office planned to build 151 hubs for everything, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 include as many as 255 transport hubs.
Of these, one and a half hundred promise to hand over this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, no quality criteria have been identified, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot;.
They report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant at each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, a reduction in the transfer time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging TPU, sometimes it turns out exactly the opposite.
A striking example of the VDNKh metro station.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavskoe highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russian Exhibition Center.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl on Cosmonauts Street.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
In vain that the residents did not want the bus station under the windows at all and complained to all possible authorities.
Somehow it didn’t work out right away with the capital transport hubs in Moscow.
The first of them began to be built about five years ago near the Planernaya metro station.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be an example of how a transfer hub, given at the mercy of investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy so as not to walk from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 were not given a place in the Moscow TPU in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there is more space for trade.
There are 32 shops for clothes alone, and in general there is almost everything - from pet supplies to a car dealership.
Well, in fact, what if some of the bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
For some reason, when we build a capital transport hub, we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when it was decided to give part of the parking lot for the market.
Now, on the third floor of the Planernaya transport hub, among the parking spaces marked on the floor, there is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and security guards glaring at our photographer.
The interchange hub has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier there was a market near the Planernaya metro station, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, they took pity on the merchants and let them into the intercepting parking lot of the transfer hub.
Anyway, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place ... a new planar TPU.
Such is the castling.
At the Kaluzhskaya metro station, the approach distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping center, allegedly a transport hub, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the structures at Planernaya and Kaluzhskaya will soon look like flowers.
In mid-September, the Town Planning and Land Commission of the Mayor&#39;s Office approved planning decisions for the first eight capital transfer hubs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro station, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters. meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of the Russian Railways, who are responsible for the construction of the transfer hub near the metro, have already told reporters that the future high-rise buildings will house shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey parking lots will occupy from a third to a half of the area.
Let&#39;s take &quot;people&#39;s&quot; garages as an example.
Let&#39;s say a garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
This means that for parking for 2,600 cars, Petrovsko-Razumovskaya will need about 80,000 square meters.
This is less than a third of the colossus that they are going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of platforms for buses.
Remains at least 150 thousand square meters. meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUM.
If capital transfer hubs near stations and railway stations are being built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be developed by metro workers.
They also promised that there would be many &quot;functional facilities&quot;, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply directly to officials for obtaining a site for TPU.
Without any competition.
Because, they say, transport issues for the city are a priority.
An ideal transport hub is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadine station in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams go underground to the level of the metro and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as worries about stockpiling overshadowed a report showing that China&#39;s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
Benchmark US crude for December delivery fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late morning ET in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, adding up to a 5.8 percent drop in October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy on Wednesday said US inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports from the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China&#39;s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent from a twenty-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, the benchmark international crude also used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As Novy Region was informed by the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for the Sverdlovsk Region, the day before in the Kirovsky district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women were found with signs of violent death.

Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the KHL regular season match against Salavat, noted that Omsk had a thorough analysis of the defeat from Metallurg Magnitogorsk.
The specialist stressed that the &quot;Vanguard&quot; need to pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Metallurg Magnitogorsk, - the official website of Avangard quotes Chebaturkin&#39;s words.
– Missed a lot of goals, not a very pleasant moment.
They conceded because of their mistakes, because of failure to complete the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - we scored three goals.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account when preparing for today&#39;s game?
The guys and I carefully analyze every match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game task was carried out, and the score was 2:0.
We conceded a goal “to the locker room” – and in the third period we started to make mistakes.
Considering how difficult the game was, I did not see the point in including defenders.
The entire team must defend.
Now Avangard has a long home streak, matches go every other day - has the team accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of their moments and the fulfillment of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you follow the instructions, everything is not so difficult to solve.
Bombardier&#39;s profit falls as deliveries and aircraft orders fall
Bombardier Corp., a Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit Thursday, driven by lower third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its latest CSeries aircraft or provide new information on whether the aircraft&#39;s ambitious plans to enter commercial service by next September will be met.
The prototype aircraft has only flown three more times since its first flight about a month and a half ago, raising questions about whether the test phase is on schedule.
The results fell short of forecasts and sent stocks down more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, cut his estimate Thursday from &quot;above market&quot; to &quot;mid market&quot; on the belief that stock gains are limited for the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was broadly predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transportation department&#39;s earnings performance,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to carve out a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are still low at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to test the company&#39;s claims about the new jet&#39;s fuel efficiency and potential economy.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft entered commercial service.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program was moving forward as planned.
&quot;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft&#39;s downtime.
All manufacturers plan testing differently.
We decided to make the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will continue throughout the flight test program.
The second of five test units is due to fly in the coming weeks and the rest will soon follow, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the commissioning timeline and will provide new information in the next few months.
&quot;This slow pace of flight testing - while apparently in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross revenue declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts were expecting earnings of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace division&#39;s order book was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In aerospace, the results were in line with our goals, but the low number of incoming orders and general market conditions were a nuisance,” Beaudoin said.
Gross aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transportation division was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31.
The revenues of the transportation division were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google&#39;s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, the world&#39;s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier&#39;s closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
A certificate was stolen from the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court by hitting him on the head
Unknown people attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk regional court, Vladimir Dvoekonko, stealing his identity card.
According to &quot;Interfax&quot;, late on Wednesday night, attackers hit the judge on the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old chairman of the court came to his senses, he found that his official ID had been pulled out.
The criminals did not take money and other valuables.
Dvoekonko got home on his own, and turned to the police only the next day.
The crime is being investigated and the search for criminals is underway.
Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria, senior official says
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile shipments inside Syria.
Thorium - a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy does without both, but leaves behind a lot of waste that is expensive to dispose of.
Recently, scientists have turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
New automatic machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of sit-ups will be counted by a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Vystavochnaya station on November 8, 2013.
President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champion gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova will take part in the presentation of the new ticket sports facilities.

Two YMCA employees indicted for sex crimes before Jonathan Lord charges, Royal Commission has learned
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex crimes before charges were filed in 2011 against Karingbach childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse told the Royal Commission.
But the commission&#39;s opening statement said it &quot;has never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization.&quot;
CEO Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA worker was charged with child pornography offenses and another when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children under his care in 1991 year.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also made an inaccuracy in its opening speech to the commission, stating that &quot;there were external reviews of the YMCA that recognized that the YMCA is at the forefront of child safety.&quot;
The evidence presented to the commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and lower management made a mistake in hiring Lord and also failed to ensure staff clearly understood their obligation to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the suggestion that the YMCA&#39;s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord&#39;s child safety violations.
Employees testified that they observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally looked after them, sat them on his lap, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord&#39;s care and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, child care manager for the Karingbach YMCA who was Lord&#39;s supervisor, &quot;very intimidating and often inaccessible.&quot;
The chief executive said that he did not accept employees&#39; explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the need to report him.
Mr Hare said he presented to the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson for the organization from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was not &quot;about providing information&quot; by employees, and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was taken by YMCA Child Custody CEO Liam Wheatley.
He said it was intended to prevent corruption of evidence, but was &quot;overdone&quot; and poorly implemented.
YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization during Jonathan Lord&#39;s tenure from 2009-2011, child molestation expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and supervising staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Guillaume Nicloux&#39; adaptation of Denis Diderot&#39;s novel boasts exceptional staging and historical detail, but it&#39;s also heavier than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
As she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic abbess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never stoops to vulgarity or sensationalism - and that&#39;s the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story runs the risk of becoming a sackcloth test for the audience as well.
US intelligence agencies listen to the personal phone of the Pope
The activity of the Vatican is under the vigilant control of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that US intelligence was listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
What in the United States attached special importance.
The secret service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also tapped.
American spies bugged all the main contenders for the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of a figure undesirable for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the &quot;big ear of the United States&quot; continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12th.
It is alleged that since 2005, the United States has singled out the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio as the future Pope.
American intelligence also monitored negotiations related to the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the US embassy in Rome, extracting information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American &quot;wiretapping&quot;, even if it happens.
The holy fathers have no secrets from the US leadership.
Ben Greenman: New York Comedy Festival Tenth Anniversary: The New Yorker
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, entertainer Frank Fay, who worked as an entertainer at the Palace Theater on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public in a colloquial manner.
Fei&#39;s innovation has been picked up over time by others, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
&quot;Most of these headliners started out at the Carolines and then went on to become more successful, to the point where they&#39;re too famous to play at the club,&quot; Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as &quot;Standup for Heroes&quot;, an annual musical comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, among others. , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in unconventional ways, such as through shows on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence with his role in a comedy series on an obscure cable channel (FXX&#39;s deliberately smutty fantasy football-themed &quot;League&quot;) and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has joined the cast of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for the viral video series Marseille is a Shell in the Shoes.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the sly, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg&#39;s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian but went on to become a successful television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
“This city is by far the centerpiece of all of Larry&#39;s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks along some street between two houses and thinks: “Now, if I am completely without money, maybe I will live here.”
