From my point of view, the program in literature was formed by the ladies of the Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19 century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to portray a certain variety of them?

The Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexate coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a slab of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the effect of the "wave" or "gamak".
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to allocate breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, perfectly ventilated in a natural way, like couchau coconut.
This preserves a healthy microclimate of the bed.
The mattress is also subject to an extended warranty period.
The term of the official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and contaminants is entrusted to the removable case of the Jacquard, supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in a couple to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember these feasts and guests in the parents’ house with horror.
Guests are on the threshold, and on the stove there are still cutters, the mother is stroked at the floor.
God, I sat down at the table without strength.
And then the dishes are used, put the house away.
A week before the holiday, you carry food, two days of cloth, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are good, and the cake is bound to with them.
I don’t like the holidays since then.
Even for my family, I set the table on a minimum.
And I cook deliciousies for them, very often for a while forbid.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough to fully protect.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of General Practists Ulrich Vaigleddt.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert believes.
In addition, Weigladt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against influenza."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of the strains of Delta or Beta.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer by March 2022 plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron.
The companies emphasize that the two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with a new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain,” BioNTech and Pfizer said.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience very convincingly shows this,” the expert stressed.
Wolseer Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for fishing.
These vibes have more than those close in size analogues, a specific weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fins of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the Leaf of Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the headset up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when caught in a limited space, cluttered underwater vegetation, staining and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing in winter for a perch and a large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive bait is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in the plumbing is able to disperse a passive pike that does not respond even to the bait.
When catching, the Bet-A-Vib scores a range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, is well combined with logging and wicker cords even large diameters.
For catching a scorching of pike, perch, cherry or perch, in addition to uniform and "step", sometimes with "chicken" in the bottom.
If you catch in the enembreled places, you can change the front tee to a doppelganger, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lure of its Bet-A-Vib class is among the most stable in the work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success can be used both in relatively small and in rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with hooks Owner ST-36.

Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November amid depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s performance for the first 11 months was worse than last year’s result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate a strain of “ocmarine”
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmarine" can be dangerous.
The reason should be found in the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “ocmarine” originated in the body of infected with HIV or immunodeficiency sufferers.
That is, during the mutation, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate “ocmarine” more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body's strong response to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So this happens with pneumococcal infections, when the young people die 30-year-old, and the elderly 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze do it.
The immune response frenzied in the young, he is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to threaten the finger, he beats like from a gun on sparrows, ”conciled Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, only symptoms can be stopped - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, until the end of the year, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old can begin to vaccinate.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very active from covid.
In teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is as much as possible.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as pupils of kindergartens, - said "Moskve 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT.
A huge thank you to the author for this article.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of covid
The authors of the work studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, could become infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The researchers also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in fat surrounding various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in adipose tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin called the causes of dementia and spoke about the ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person is difficult to navigate even in a familiar setting.
Golosheikin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
“There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence,” the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of exercise, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic engagement.

Egypt returned about 30 thousand. Illegally Removed Artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return home about 30 thousand. artifacts that were illegally exported from the country by smuggling.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat main inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has recovered 29 300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad said that all the artifacts smuggled were registered in the archives.
Now the staff of the department is working to return them to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that on the return of cultural values will be restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find a bust sold at auction in London by Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
Auction house Christie's July 4 held auctions, in which a bust of over 3 thousand years old the years was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally taken out in the 1970-ies from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported from the country at different times of antiquity.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research of “black diggers”.
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is right, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) - this is an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see. Census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to access personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank enjoys the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the employee used it to meet with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote mode of operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline, until which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside any literary associations, spitted with imaginalism, he is in itself, but is known, in demand, at times we are firmly scolding critics, even maliciously, but reading the public is ready to wear it in his hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books, the collection "Stroy Russia" were published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Goszdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergiy Alexandrovich poets was such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, engineer - 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange family life, keep the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life has been established, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if the nightmare materialized from the poem “The Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin):
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Will the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
Just like a groan in September,
Drinks the brain of alcohol.
Many friends noted that Yesenin passed a lot, looks bad, clearly sick.
Increasingly, bumps, nervous breakdowns are repeated.
And the reason, probably, not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich was put by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan corrected his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again, Yesenin will get to him two years later, in Moscow).
But the evidence of the singers of the poet, scandals on this basis, drives to the police abound - scattered on dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20's, the terrible novel of the poet with a green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin for a short time settled with a friend, imamist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or friends.
Elders remember:
“I only came to sleep, and in most cases in an insane, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stairs...
Falling, scratching his face and wheezing.
A little in himself, he constantly began to coughing, spraying the whole sheet with blood.
And Yesenin himself after the voyage in Europe and in the United States (there was then a dry law in the United States, but Duncan took with it a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the taverns and the streets...
I'm already in the end and I stopped remembering...
Well, and drank, of course...
I drank because I gnawed.”

Why didn't he tell his daughter that it was not a school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?

The Polish foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons” against the EU
The Polish foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons”
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used the refugees as “weapons” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “stoped by Lukashenko”, but he “is engaged in an active search for new ways.”
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon “in many parts of the world.”
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched upon 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve.”
Minsk in response imposed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a mockery
At the communal events of 2021, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film “Not the Time to Die” he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional “Bondov” butterfly.
His example was twice followed by Prince William, who first wore the Green Tink Jacket, which did not match the Royal Dress Code, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried on by Lionel Messiah.
The player came to take the seventh “Golden ball” in the velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already celebrating the growing demand for velvet men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to buy them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand. RUB. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the velvet jackets segment, velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands – Brian, Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the model Gucci, in which the premiere of the film “House Gucci” embassador of the brand Jared Leto came out.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interverrection of threads, a dense tissue with a villous external texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not his model or style, but the relevance.
“Velvet requires an evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event,” explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases if the invitation lists the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should acquire the right advanced party with income,” the authors of the Telegram channel about the men’s fashion “Beauty Brammell” believe. Owners of velvet jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to time-stitched secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket made of velvet with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, lofers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashionable experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: the appearance in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate party will be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "the leader from among those who run this event, then - "yes", he is such a thing in the topic."
If a employee is lower than a lower rank, and his goal is to move up higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase “not in Sedka hat”, – said the editors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so tormented.
And absolutely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don’t understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it pays.
Billions of investments.
Are they in sorrow?
The price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not in the overhead - both gas and oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
The fuel is wild demand.
The penny drips.
Who's on the flyby then?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who “slept” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good buck.
I didn’t see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrities within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not get to such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “beauties (-City), but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, a “very big period”
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he was ill and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and sick, then he received “hybrid immunity”, that is, antibodies a lot and neutralize enough,” the expert said.
The “big seven” warned Russia about “large-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow a lot” but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement said.
Further, the ministers call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine their future.
We welcome Ukraine’s restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia will be subject to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “the single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine is considered 32 times less effective from the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of the study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicron variety,” said Professor Malik Peyris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality, if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev’s acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as a non-lethal weapon.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin the supply of weapons to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation of Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the Navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense,” the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Disclosed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get back the money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of future fraud.
They were disclosed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of major losses when these bank cards fall into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be postponed to the savings account and withdraw as needed.
Experts also recommend to enter a separate map for shopping on the network.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, you can start the refund procedure.
“As part of the rules established by payment systems, under unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility rests with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and returned the money.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client, if the order has not yet been sent to the delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, said that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU law
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline “Nord stream-2”.
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose the “Nord stream-2”, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay a fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make a public commitment to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany of stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the “Big seven”.

Found money in the wall of the church plumber will be paid 20 thousand dollars
Plumbing, who found money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas, will be awarded.
This is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a major evangelical church of Lakewood, where she preached by Pastor Joel Austin, promising that devout Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is associated with the theft that occurred in the church of Lakewood seven years ago.
Then disappeared about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals announced an award that amounted to 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Coley could not claim this amount, since the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars a gift from the church of Lakewood, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the church of Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
Therefore, the attitude to it is so negative.
And it’s not that “it is financially much richer than all the scribblers,” as they write here.

This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempted from the presentation of a certificate from vaccination.
Also, the list of exceptions includes persons who arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine is proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow,” Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Disclosed the scheme of complete protection against COVID-19
Virologist, MD, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and the use of the nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, a large amount of immunoglobulins A are formed. With the introduction of the vaccine, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination,” the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District, MD Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with the injection is the possibility of stopping being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be the maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that a new surge in the pandemic COVID-19 will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this picture is observed in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I and the male (died for a long time) talked like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and playing for the regular bitch, then forward.
But the pesel was trained and generally smart.
I chose my society and went home.
In the video, a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many of the owners so that they did not run for the dog, although they lamented that 200 thousand were running away (ground), directly picked up the hand and took away in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, the mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health authorities’ policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription “This is a false pandemic”, “I will not be vaccinated”.
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports of the authorities of a number of regions of the country was made against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, MD", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I believe that they both deserve this title.
That's just with one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only the death and looting of any country, wherever they appear.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the spread of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The pace of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
As of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is true that it has been actively spreading only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain according to preliminary data can bypass the prevalence of the “delta” strain, it is also an Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omicron” in the coming months will displace the “delta”.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is with the fact that officially the “omicron” at the moment in the Kingdom sick a few hundred people, and according to estimated data up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain "omicron", and at the peak in the hospitals will take more than 2 thousand people daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
About how the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "omicron" is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalea Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of ageing?
It would be better to see more about doing your exercises.
It is not clear in the first exercise, how to do: sitting on the heels or standing on your knees, as it is written, but then how do you rest your hands on the hips?
Or hands on the waist?
Curious Protein, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite another, communicate easily and easily, and in a personal meeting and nothing to say.
And live to see a person, perhaps this is not what you expected, did not catch - hence the attitude.
When he meets his person, then the views will change.
And again, the Soviet time is called the “time of demons.”
People believed in God more honestly than they did today.
And they were brought up almost according to God’s laws (love of one’s neighbor, do not steal, etc. d.)
What an ideology today is money at any cost.
Boltuns like Globa have little faith (yes there is no one at all), but even if so, then the time of demons came in the 90's.
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal with Bolshoy Zelenina maintains communication so far.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but the warmth of the relations of the older generation is trying to preserve.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and no one canceled the siege brotherhood.

The brother pushed, without calculating the force?
And you are always really so clever that never inadvertently touched anyone and never injured yourself?

Russians warned about a new scheme of scammers
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.

According to Ivideon, director of Ivideon, Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger, which is associated with the distribution of video communication tools, are deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural networks manage to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfeek, attackers can call a friend of the victim by video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for mailing for blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks in the case when it comes to technologies using video.

Listed five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - a decrease in the number of various drinks and the transition to ordinary water positively affect the metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous indicator when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
The food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the appearance of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and an increase in the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the “migraine of the day off” at the workaholics
To the deterioration of well-being at the weekend can lead several factors
The reason for the deterioration of health after working days is often the “migraine of the day before”, said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systems Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in his Telegram channel.

Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
Our lives change radically on the weekend.
“We take a long time, all day we lie on the couch, most likely eat more, and we drink less,” the doctor argued. Due to lack of coffee, a little breakage begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness. "
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you stand three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a crucial role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to trace what is most changed over the weekend.

South African scientists say low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “omicron”
In South Africa said about the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against “omicron”
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.

How much hidden sugar in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to calorie sugar, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other dug sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasas (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are related to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctoral sausages, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugars are dire taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. Initially, they contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues to switch to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that recorded support from Berlin from the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline “does not yet comply with the requirements” of the European Union.

In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on 12 December ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of residents of New Caledonia voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published published by local authorities, 3.51% (2 755 people) voted for the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75 762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, more than 80 thousand took part in the elections. residents of New Caledonia.
As the Intermediate Results of France-Presse commented, “the outcome of this election did not leave room for doubt”, as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents the conduct of a full-fledged and “honest” election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.

As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific.”
“The new Caledonia must remain French,” Eric Zemmoor said in a statement.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Peceres, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Kasteks, for his part, expressed “a strong desire for the choice of Caledonians to be the choice of France.”

Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “put a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
“In this article quite a lot of false information”, – quotes RIA Novosti the comment of one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to “lost” it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The U.S. and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine,” another said.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lies at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like,” Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it “in all characteristics”.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by the Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, who arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown, from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were heading.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the nearby protective net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized lions with the help of rods with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer because of vitamin B9
Studies show that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence of whether people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less at risk of getting some cancers, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a greater or lesser direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fein called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocado, Fine recommended that men after 50 years more often eat this fruit.
In the UK by April, due to the omicron strain, about 75 thousand may die. Man
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England may die up to 75 thousand. person, if you do not tighten the restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand will be recorded in the country. deaths due to the strain of omicron, and in total will be hospitalized about 175 thousand. patients.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence of the hospital, more than 2 thousand will be taken. Infected every day.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent congestion of the National Health Service, if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and the existing vaccines will not be able to eliminate infections,” said the mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, the strain of omicron could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure may reach 10 thousand. cases.

Demand for superyachts increased in the world by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for the next year are hitting all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $ 50 million and above will not decrease, writes “Gardian”.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that such a hype in the market has not been in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford the yacht are afraid of contamination on land and are preferred to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held on zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose to introduce new taxes and rules for super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do this.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a feed length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Reckke is building a yacht REV Ocean with a length of 183 meters.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht provides a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, platforms for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, as, for example, on the yacht of the wrestler McGregor - a platform for martial arts.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon footprint produced by super-rich, is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that multi-billionaires in the world are a little more than 2000 people.
This is just another example of overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the trace of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then Roman Abramovich, the largest polluter on the planet, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint was tingched on his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and let the command drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superyachts do not speculate the sympathy of other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinhard, who owns the continent’s mines, complain through YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to have a berth.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the use of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
What’s more, moderately in moderate men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women’s.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists cannot determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not know how tetrapod pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to surely learn how the intellect of animals is developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, however, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or compose poems, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of the ability to learn, are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “distlicit” about Ukraine’s accession to NATO, said analyst Oleksandr Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but just send a offer.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a bargaining, ”the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparation is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and not wait for the group to be discovered and deployed forces of countermeasures,” he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Equipment Production in 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said the representative of the company Khou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running along the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and performance of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed “Chinese velocity”.
In May of this year, the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first double-developed high-speed electric trains designed to export to Europe in China came off.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the company for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport of the city.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“The China Railroad Equipment Industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Jaosyan, head of the China Trade and Investment Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCCMT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-quality equipment production in the global market," Feng said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of auxiliary tools and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Golosheikin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairment, such as inability to concentrate, planning, a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease, and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective methods of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, to reduce the risk of developing dementia will help the study of foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory engagement and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still discussed in the scientific community," Goloshikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” said Golosheikin.
Earlier, the charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarm sign can be considered to be vision problems, because of which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia – a condition where a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervenous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the doctor’s consultation created under the ombudsman of Georgia, told reporters.
Its [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character,” the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
“We call it neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia,” Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after the prison staff was subjected to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore itself in the same rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia there were protests against a mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the Agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants of the action was approximately 3 thousand. man.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
They accused the state of totalitarianism by slogans on their posters and urged to respect the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city said a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic revealed more than 5.2 million cases of infection with coronavirus, over 88 thousand. The patients are dead.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated.
Bills on a unified system of QR codes were submitted by the government to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a medical leave for vaccination.
The same rules will be set for travel by train and plane.

Cool rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow you to collect 1 trillion yuan, which is designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taivu in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
But that is still far away.
Game Advisor Justin Downs says since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
Gao Maong, 70, lives in Chunley, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was held from Beijing to Chunley, now none of the locals suffers without work.
The country opens more and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of catering with dishes of national cuisine.
In Taiwan, there is now even a testing station for COVID-19.
China is committed to creating a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to pandemics, WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and WB published two complementary reports on 12 December.
They stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930’s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have little to have social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disconnected from broadcasting on the “Summit for Democracy” at the request of the White house
The speech of the Minister of digital technologies of Taiwan Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the US-organized “Summit for Democracy” was put into mode without video, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was allocated in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which was shown by Mrs. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries in the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was singled out green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
The PRC was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could go against the policy of “one China” adhere to Washington.
One of the sources of the agency said that after the map of the map, the US National Security Council angerically contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a separate country.
The summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

Do not need one pile - bad people are, you may have claims to them on a specific matter ...
But what about the number of children, age, pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "Blessedsters, did not return the money."
But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if this is the only thing you can, so what right do you have to condemn them?
It's probably just in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their rules, frankly spitting on existing ones.
And if this will concern other spheres of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
For them, the laws are not written.
And if the father still introduces his method of upbringing and education?
It’s a bad example for others very much.

The foreign Ministry told about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that a long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion following the long journey that we have taken with the current administration, with Trump and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in the position of Washington.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress was not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug against COVID outside hospitals
Those who are vaccinated with the Nasal Vaccine against COVID-19 may be allergic and they will need the help of doctors, so the first points for instilling with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with the nasal vaccine at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that operate in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, ”Natesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when the experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated with nasal congestion does not lose its nose after injection.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer himself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Rossiya 1 television channel.

WHO Preliminarily Deems “Omicron” Less Dangerous Than ‘Dalta’
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein strain “omicron” suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it (“the severity of the disease” – ed.) could be less heavy than the “delta”,” the WHO said in a technical statement.
The organization notes that while all reported cases of infection with the “omicron” in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the “delta”.
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalea Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal “Glavred”.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition to the authorities with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", - added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which it is possible to confront domestically.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the groups of the population and the president who disagreed with Zelensky, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this scenario of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting the authorities,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into a “father of the nation.”
This can lead to a certain event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This option of developing the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low values, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine for Zelensky would give their vote only 21.8%, while for the ex-President of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% expressed support for the president among all respondents.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For a quote of Yevtushenko give 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #Poetrosi Bigmmenpost was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander under an administrative article on a repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the culture of the common in Russia and the just little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and reveal the message in more detail.
How did the police officers contacted you during the arrest this time and earlier?
What did you ask in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention as polite as possible, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkin took riot police and took hard.
Asked standard, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, looked, if not approved, then understanding.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all 4 sides of the monkey, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going on.
And if after the action under this hashtag they begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, the language of others is spoken, so that it is clear to everyone what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is carried out according to the old-fashioned pen, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help to function to the body systems.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.

However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to extinguish or cook, and not fry on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with high glycemic indicators.
These are products containing carbohydrates that quickly break down on sugars such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned about a possible shortage of Russian canteen potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of “Yandex”
Candidates for departure
In 2015. copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster made a list of the 100 largest pirate sites of the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, director general of the Institute for Internet Studies.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks, among other things, to a regular change in domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series “Game of Squid” and “Tenderness” directed by Anna Melikyan – the original series of the largest video service ivi in Russia (part of the AIB).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the issuance of search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (filmed in the cinema pirated copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available for the series "Univer. 10 years later" TNT (part of Gazprom-Media) TV channel.

Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions for Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for the life of the clouds of Venus, and then the search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest to the Earth planet, were too acidic to exist there, but probably Venus was originally a planet of the earth.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like an earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life has not begun on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth, ”said Mihkel Payusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Vienna Life Finder project.

Metauniverses will change the Russian business
The theme of the meta-univers became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as all over the world, will invest in the creation of their own meta-univers and their subsequent monetization.
Metauniverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards the creation of remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of dissolution and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
On the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money turn into a digital format.

You can eat by spoon, try it, and enough.
After all, there are really ten days ahead, you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it’s time to return to relations, where interest rates, taking into account inflation, would correlate with the expected GDP growth rates.
O’Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of the ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing the level of poverty and climate change, O’Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department “Opening Investment” Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations at the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The growing percentage of Hyundai related Kia is even more significant - more than 35%, and the proceeds from the sale of cars are estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand is also to increase the weighted average price of the car - for the year Hyundai it has grown by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz were stronger than the dynamics of the rise in price.
At the same time, sales volumes from Korean brands have not increased so much: according to the statistics of the committee of automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The three leaders in terms of sales in monetary terms, the Japanese Toyota is closed - on the cars of this brand, the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand also increased the volume of sales (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Merchestra-Benz has a good increase in sales and weighted average price - for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth of financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabaji. -
In terms of sales growth, fantastic figures are demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada in terms of income growth dynamics demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand, the Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles for 10 months.
At the level of last year, the financial capacity is the companies whose sales in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and at all in the red - for 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickup trucks of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, which covered the entire world automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AVTOVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price by 8-10 thousand. ruble) happened at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is making its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recoup past losses, experts say.
In a car shortage, I think many automakers were even able to partially shift the costs of past periods to the consumer, which they could not put in the price of cars earlier.
says VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers feel very good now, maintaining a high margin of sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow in quantitative terms, and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth of the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to receive their income from volumes, said independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the greatest profit from each car sold, Burgazliyev notes. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - the car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert says.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” of Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans,” the White House chief said, answering a journalist’s question about whether the U.S. abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not worth it on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries against which we have a sacred commitment to protect them from any attack from Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of Kiev drones supplied by Kiev, as well as that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
