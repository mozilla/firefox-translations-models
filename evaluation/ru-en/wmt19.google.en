Named the number of recruits preparing to be sent to the Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People&#39;s Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People&#39;s Republic (LPR), Andriy Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kyiv plans to &quot;at least somehow understaff the units.&quot;
&quot;The unwillingness of the citizens of Ukraine to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing levels,&quot; Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later changed to the Joint Forces Operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of the Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the assassination of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The authorities of the DPR qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
US authorities forced Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will leave the position of chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla company he founded at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the department allows Musk to remain in a leadership position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $ 20 million and leave the position of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to replace him.
It is specified that the agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders with a statement about the availability of sufficient funds to buy back shares of this company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
We are talking about the publication of a businessman on Twitter, where he announced his desire to buy back Tesla shares at $420 apiece, but never did so.
After the tweet, the company&#39;s shares rose nearly 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Office compared the EU with the Soviet Union and a prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, in this way, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, then the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only increase, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,&quot; the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations had stalled.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
Brexit was decided in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

The head of the Altai village council stopped the hunger strike in defense of the interests of residents
The MP said on his Facebook page that he stopped the hunger strike for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation has reached a dead end, the district administration does not respond to his demands, and he needs to do his job.

Also, the residents of the village council compiled and took away to the governor of the Altai Territory a mass collective appeal, &quot;regarding the current catastrophic situation.&quot;
Boronin himself said that he felt fine, he fulfilled his duties as head during the hunger strike to the fullest.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Sibirsky and Rogulichny have centralized heating systems, which means that the administration of Pervomaisky district should carry out the authority to prepare them for winter.
However, no one has started this work so far.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of settlements for the winter, Boronin demanded &quot;immediately organize a full-fledged independent section of public utilities with the appropriate staff units on the territory of the municipality.&quot;
Named new buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a cost of up to four million rubles were bought in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of these transactions were in two residential complexes, according to the materials of the Urbanus portal (available to Lenta.ru).
The leaders in terms of housing sales in the budget of up to four million rubles were the Nekrasovka residential complex, located outside the Moscow Ring Road, in the Kotelniki district (South-East Administrative District), and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibirevo district (SVAO).

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users complained about the problems in the Telegram messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The user&#39;s phone number can be found by his username
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after updating the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic app updates until the issue is resolved.
On April 13, the Tagansky Court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, telecom operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on the terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a court order.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk forced to step down as chairman of Tesla&#39;s board of directors
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud dispute.
It is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to keep the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
A similar amount will be collected from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is included in the list of the 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, the neurotech company Neuralink and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible company buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla private and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set allegedly &quot;due to the significance of this number in marijuana culture,&quot; Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the co-director of the commission&#39;s security department, Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the allegations of fraud to be unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
&quot;Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way,&quot; the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman&#39;s posts brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman&#39;s tweets were misleading, because of which the sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy securities at artificially high prices in order to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk&#39;s careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk was also accused of stock fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with removal from the leadership of the company and even prison.
This, in particular, was stated to CNBC by the former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt.
Musk is &quot;a nice guy who can&#39;t run a car company.&quot;

The ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, a possible church schism and its political overtones
According to him, now, when &quot;the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage,&quot; renaming the church is the same as &quot;putting on a yellow six-pointed star&quot; in Nazi Germany.
&quot;This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this very purpose,&quot; a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the air of the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since &quot;the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.&quot;
UOC urged exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: full house, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak, summing up the results of the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
In the foreseeable future, the result of our meeting with automakers should be the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We must stimulate our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don’t think it’s possible in such a time frame.
I think a more realistic timeframe is within the next ten years.&quot;
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team performed in Formula 1 under a Russian license.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a national team in the Formula 1 World Championship.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team,” he said.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let&#39;s hope we have such a team.
I suspect that thoughts about creating a team appeared, among other things, because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi.&quot;
Tomorrow Sochi Autodrom expects a full house.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications, the stands were almost full, - the vice-premier noted.
I can say that this year&#39;s revenue has grown by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of using Sochi Autodrom&#39;s infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not bypass the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniil together and wish him success in the next season, the Deputy Prime Minister told Izvestia.
He is a promising racing driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton at once.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the &quot;Royal Races&quot; is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results so far are not impressive: he took 18th place in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let&#39;s hope that next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, that is exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the isolation of penicillin from fungi was not Fleming&#39;s first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he sowed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish (this is such a glass lid in which experiments are carried out with bacteria) and after a few days found that the bacteria there were destroyed.
Almost as accidentally, he discovered penicillin.
Fleming&#39;s name was included in the list of 100 most prominent personalities in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the most ancient diseases that were previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, the Parisian newspapers wrote: &quot;To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions.&quot;
According to experts, Fleming&#39;s discovery of the world&#39;s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated and a week later his ashes were buried in London&#39;s famous St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral.
Where, by the way, my wife and I paid attention to this talkative Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, we happened to observe the full-length statue of Alexander Fleming in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main bullfighting arena, Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man who, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me in the same place, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all on this occasion.

Although there were rumors about their wedding back in April, the couple officially concluded only now - on September 29.
According to People magazine, the private ceremony took place at Paltrow&#39;s house on Long Island.

Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple&#39;s Safari browser.
According to Business Insider, payouts will rise to $12 billion next year.

In early August, Apple became the first US company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.
From previously published reports, it follows that the net profit of the corporation in the III quarter increased by 32% compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

Trump spoke about the &quot;fall in love&quot; with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK have almost fallen in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump famously joked about his success on the North Korean crisis front.
Having started with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have straightened relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama&#39;s team launched relations with the DPRK so much that they could not even get through to the country&#39;s leadership - they simply did not pick up the phone there.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes &quot;beautiful letters&quot; to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also &quot;cruel&quot; to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders &quot;fell in love with each other.&quot;
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and also closes military training grounds.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
As a result of the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still stalling.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them &quot;gangster.&quot;

Nitsa urged to replace &quot;Moscow language with Ukrainian product&quot;
Ukrainian children&#39;s writer and fighter for the purity of their native language, Larisa Nitsoi, called for the expulsion of &quot;the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language&quot; from Ukraine.
She proposes to do this with a Ukrainian product - &quot;a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught.&quot;
Nitsa shared her thoughts on &quot;the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine&quot; with the Ukrainian publication Obozrevatel.
According to her, a corresponding Ukrainian product is being prepared now - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will &quot;recover&quot; from this &quot;Moscow language,&quot; she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian was widely used on television and radio, but it has practically disappeared in public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only &quot;expanding the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level.&quot;
Earlier, Nitsa shared her experience of maintaining the &quot;Ukrainian-speaking regime&quot; in a children&#39;s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which spoke to her in Russian.
Not having achieved her goal, Nitsoi threw change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians &quot;linguistic schizophrenia&quot;, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently Nitsa claimed that the name &quot;Rus&quot; was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The wrath of the writer could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she arrived there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.
During the break, we had a male conversation, and it bore fruit
Defender &quot;Ural&quot; Denis Kulakov - about the victory over &quot;Arsenal&quot; (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
&quot;Denis, due to what, in your opinion, did you manage to win?&quot;
&quot;It seems to me that we wanted to win more,&quot; Ural&#39;s official website quoted Kulakov as saying.
&quot;It turned out to be such a difficult game, during the break we had a serious men&#39;s conversation, and it paid off: we scored two goals and did not concede.
&quot;You missed a few matches because of the injury you got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?&quot;
“If you endured 90 minutes, then everything is fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end I saved a little strength so that nothing would happen.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
&quot;What can you say about the atmosphere in the team?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s no secret to anyone that after victories it&#39;s easier to recover, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.&quot;
&quot;Missed the game during the time you didn&#39;t take the field?&quot;
“There is such a thing, I got a little bored, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But once again I repeat, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
Everything else is secondary.&quot;

Citizens in a referendum on Sunday are asked to answer one question: &quot;Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?&quot;
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which is the same as the name of the northern Greek region.

The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.

Elections to the Armenian parliament may take place as early as 2018, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
&quot;It is possible that before the end of the year,&quot; the head of government answered a question from journalists about the timing of their holding (quote from Interfax).

I hope that they too are set for a constructive dialogue,&quot; Novosti-Armenia quoted the prime minister as saying.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are &quot;the demand of the people&quot;, as well as part of the government&#39;s program, which the parliament voted for.

At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after returning to Yerevan to start &quot;negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of early elections.&quot;
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA), which is in opposition to Mr. Pashinyan.

According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, speaking of the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support, following the example of Syria.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
&quot;The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years regarding Russia has now been an order of magnitude more subdued,&quot; the senator said in an interview published on Sunday. Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes &quot;designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, either along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which was quite unanimous on this point.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, &quot;the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent.&quot;
&quot;If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British now, in any case, there was absolutely no chorus,&quot; the politician drew attention, noting that Russia &quot;is more was not some kind of wall against which tennis balls are practiced.&quot;
The head of the profile committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, &quot;will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three.&quot;
&quot;I do not rule out that the current session in some sense can be a turning point,&quot; Kosachev admitted, explaining that &quot;there are too many examples of how, with Russia&#39;s involvement, it is possible to move forward in international affairs.&quot;
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
&quot;So far, unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,&quot; the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is &quot;an adequate, sensible perception of Russia as not just a possible, but an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time.&quot;
&quot;I would not like to be mistaken, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement back, it will be a movement forward,&quot; he added.
Another &quot;interesting and important feeling&quot; in this context, Kosachev called &quot;a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.&quot;
&quot;I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if even a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in In the world, by and large, no one was interested, but now the situation is different,&quot; the chairman of the committee of the Federation Council said.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that &quot;the so-called new liberal order, which is personified by the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration&quot;.
&quot;And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,&quot; Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers &quot;the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia.&quot;

There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, would not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all, all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea,&quot; Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will temper every Ukrainian, making us &quot;angrier, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.&quot;

On October 7, he was charged with spying for the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
The Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
“It was as if I had been hit on the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They put me in the hospital.
I couldn’t hold a spoon there, I couldn’t stand, I fell all the time.
They started to do tests, it turned out that things were bad, the artery did not let blood through.
They brought me to Moscow, where they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently performed an operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst,&quot; Kikabidze said in the Odnazhdy program.
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to their idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor&#39;s wife did not allow the living actor to be buried, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and did not leave the bed of her beloved husband for more than a year.
If not for Irina, I would not be alive now.
Whenever I had critical situations, she was there like a rock,&quot; the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he refutes rumors either about his illness or about an untimely death, which now and then appear on the Web.
The creators of the &quot;Peacemaker&quot; website have added Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó to the &quot;Purgatory&quot; section.
The reason was &quot;an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.&quot;
In addition, the head of the Foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was convicted of &quot;direct threats of invasion of Ukraine&quot; and &quot;support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine&quot;, as well as participation &quot;in organizing a provocation aimed at massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by citizens of Ukraine.&quot;
It should be noted that in front of Szijjarto in &quot;Purgatory&quot; the vicar of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy) Onufry pleased.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities named the amount of the &quot;golden parachute&quot; of the Voronezh deputy governor
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh Region, Yuri Agibalov, was made on the basis of the regional law &quot;On Public Positions&quot;.

Thus, the press service emphasized, the size of the lump sum payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, minus income tax, and not 1 million rubles, which was written about by the media.
The official has been receiving an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.

State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the committee on education and science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that adolescents are provoked to masturbate by harmful information that they find on the Internet.
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station &quot;Moscow Speaks&quot;:
As part of the general sexual education of children, this must be done, explaining the harm, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it consists in the fact that the maturation of children occurs quite early, and then there are big scissors between their puberty and the possibility of officially entering into intersexual contacts.
According to Onishchenko, &quot;prudence&quot;, hushing up of &quot;problems of sexual age&quot; and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children are hindering the solution of the problem.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face masturbation.
The deputy believes that lessons about the dangers of onanism should be practiced primarily in schools in &quot;hyper-urbanized&quot; regions.
&quot;If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, they will simply not understand us, to put it mildly,&quot; the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is an acting academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor.

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel are falling.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to seriously tire of Angela Merkel&#39;s immigration policy, thanks to which the country has become a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest opinion polls show this most clearly, according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the rating of people&#39;s sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of their popularity, managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but one cannot but note the established fact that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists, managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings is still held by the ruling block of the CSU / CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, support for Angela Merkel&#39;s bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let&#39;s add that after the Social Democrats settled &quot;green&quot; (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
The evolution of &quot;Alternative&quot;
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government&#39;s course, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany&#39;s &quot;sponsoring&quot; of the weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country&#39;s complete withdrawal from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the political platform of the AfD expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party, which occupied the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to get into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; get seats in the European Parliament.
Published a video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine &quot;a nation of idiots&quot;
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted on the air that he considers his compatriots a &quot;nation of idiots.&quot;
They believe in TV and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
&quot;We are not instilled with a culture of reading and accepting texts from childhood,&quot; the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov&#39;s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of Nezalezhnoy began to crack down on literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kyiv authorities, banning as many as 201 publications from being imported.

Canadians have created a car in case of an apocalypse
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defense Solutions said it was already accepting applications for its new armored car.
Armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
It&#39;s not just video game makers, film studios, and book publishers who make money on the apocalypse theme.
Now automobile companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defense Solutions presented its armored car of the apocalypse Senator APC.
In their free time from fantasy, the engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who, without much comfort, but in complete safety, are accommodated in an all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise you can’t name the design, since the level of its armor meets the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
So that even the blast wave from a shell that exploded next to the car does not harm the passengers, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For a safer view, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with an all-round camera system with night vision, as well as an armored observation tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
The front of the cabin of the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
So that the weight of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower hardy 6.7-liter turbodiesel engine, all the power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There is no chance to get stuck at the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
You can see the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will be held in October.
Called the death of the universe
The universe will continue to exist for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observable world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study by an international team of scientists has been uploaded to the arXiv.org electronic preprint library and submitted for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports.
Experts came to similar conclusions by observing with the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists, working within the standard ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model, estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru observatory notes that the observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the inclusion of data from the European Planck space telescope has clarified the limitations imposed on the ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the observable world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Rip.
Failed another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
Opportunity to know people&#39;s opinion on pension reform postponed indefinitely
On Saturday, a meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: “Are you in favor of the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens become entitled to an old-age pension , did not rise?&quot;
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but they considered it the simplest and most legally capacious.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Just Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (15 other subgroups supported her wording), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and did not plan to come: &quot;We did not understand who is friend and who is foe.&quot;
Blues singer Otis Rush dies

He died as a result of complications after suffering a stroke in 2003.
Rush&#39;s work has influenced such musicians as Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.

Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: &quot;Admiral&quot; has created big problems for us
Ak Bars head coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the KHL regular season match against Admiral (4:2).

&quot;We have our own program, according to which he works.
Therefore, there was such a decision,&quot; the press service of the club quoted Bilyaletdinov as saying.

In the Loko-Akhmat match, Turbine&#39;s mistakes rained down like from a cornucopia
Former referee of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian Championship &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; - &quot;Akhmat&quot; and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you evaluate Evgeny Turbin&#39;s refereeing in the match &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; - &quot;Akhmat&quot;?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unsuitability to officiate matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that neither Turbin himself nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualifications during the meeting of the fifth round of Spartak - Dynamo.
The result was not slow to tell in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, frequent omissions of rude tricks rained down like from a cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railroad Eder fills up with the help of his hands in his own penalty area, the defender of &quot;Akhmat&quot; Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idovu, who was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
– I believe that there was a deliberate handball defender in his own penalty area.
Turbin was next to the moment, he sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three overslept and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the very case when refereeing by concepts displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guests&#39; defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
It was necessary to show the second &quot;yellow card&quot;?
– At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams are given penalties for such violations, as in the episode with Idovu, but some are not.
What do you evaluate the words of a football player?
- It depends what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
It was not given.
This means that the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee is watching who is playing.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and Akhmat has serious complaints about Turbin&#39;s work, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon plays accused rapist Judge Cavanaugh at SNL launch
American actor Matt Damon played US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared on the first episode of the new season of NBC&#39;s Saturday Night Live.
During a small skit, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention for his emotionality and the detail of his stories during an interview with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he never got drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh stated that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows this,&quot; said the referee, played by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh was previously elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand discovers strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her deceased dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
&quot;They don&#39;t look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it&#39;s impossible to clone a soul,&quot; the 76-year-old singer said.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so tiny.
The United States thought about the naval blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world&#39;s main energy suppliers.
The head of the US Department of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke&#39;s statement came out completely within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not devoid of a political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the US Navy, the US controls the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
It followed from Zinke&#39;s words that the need could be related to Washington&#39;s desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion&#39;s share of its income from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow&#39;s activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The Minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push back Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along this path, Zinke believes.

Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the Director General of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute. Zhukovsky Kirill Sypalo.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortiums and in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

A club appeared in Russia that I follow
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry on why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian Championship &quot;Spartak&quot; - &quot;Rostov&quot; (0:1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I&#39;ve been watching recently and it was interesting to see it from the outside.
I can’t say that I am a fan, since my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision made, ”the Chelsea fans website quotes Terry as saying.
Recall that “Rostov” with 18 points climbed to third place in the standings, and “Spartak” is in fifth place with 15 points.
In the next round, the red-and-whites on October 7 will play on the road with Enisey, and Valery Karpin&#39;s wards will host Orenburg the day before.
Expensive violin handed over to a pawnshop for next to nothing
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop employee offered only $ 50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive instrument, and turned to an expert for advice.
It was then that it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Violin bows alone are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is still unknown how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he does not have any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, is not at all a stranger to the &quot;people&#39;s team&quot;.
This meeting is especially piquant because the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind the far-riding Zenit and being one point away from Krasnodar, which plays tomorrow with &quot;Dynamo&quot;.
The red and whites are now having a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League Massimo Carrera&#39;s team unexpectedly flew into Rapida, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat Chernomorets in the Cup with a minimum score and not without difficulty, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has come close to overcoming the crisis.
“Rostov” could not win three matches in a row, but it has not known defeats for five matches already.
Let&#39;s see if Karpin manages to extend his unbeaten streak with such an important match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky &quot;Rostov&quot; with &quot;Spartak&quot; ended in favor of the capital&#39;s team.
Start - at 19:00.
Indonesia rocked by aftershocks after powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake struck a few days ago, which triggered a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, according to the TV channel &quot;Russia 24&quot;.
The death toll exceeded 420 people, and more than five hundred were injured.
The authorities notified the population about the tsunami threat in advance, but later it was canceled.
The fact is that the instruments did not detect the approach of the wave.
Until now, the fate of dozens more residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the embankments of the city of Palu, which was the most destroyed after the disaster, is still unknown.
London burst into accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
There are more and more threats, Iran and North Korea are more and more dangerous, enemies are operating in gray areas with the help of cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, ex-GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a name change.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which is the same as the name of a neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today&#39;s voting.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled around the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the preparation of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparations for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Fay Dulgheri: &quot;About 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting process.
The monitoring teams record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions in order to then set them out in the final report.&quot;
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
On the International Day of the Interpreter, September 30, this was told by a professional simultaneous interpreter Berbel Sakse.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
&quot;The Germans like to calmly plan events, and the Russians, as the proverb says, &quot;harness for a long time, but they go fast.&quot;
But it seems to me that this does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of a translator,&quot; the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, in order to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, &quot;it is enough to know history.&quot;
And in the future, Saxe noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,&quot; she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to &quot;establish relations&quot; with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin mania.

In 2009-2014 he was the Russian Ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians donated one ruble for a deputy with a low salary
In Yekaterinburg, the Human Charitable Foundation opened a fundraiser for State Duma deputy Vera Ganzi, who complained about her low salary.
The progress of the campaign can be tracked on the organization&#39;s website.
&quot;The Charitable Foundation &quot;Chelovechek&quot; expresses the hope that we will be able to save the servant of the people with the whole world.

Ganja lamented that parliamentarians are not compensated for representation expenses.
After that, the State Duma announced that they would consider the possibility of paying representation expenses to deputies.

Comedy &quot;Night School&quot; tops US box office
The comedy Night School, which debuted in U.S. theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its opening weekend at the box office.
This result allowed the uncomplicated picture starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the US box office for September 28-30.
Internationally, the film, which has so far only been released in 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million, including $2 million from UK audiences.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is noteworthy, quite noticeably outstripped another newcomer to Western distribution - the cartoon &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig, grossed $23 million over its opening weekend, generally living up to the expectations of experts who predicted the film would make $20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, at the moment they are $ 38.6 million (at the same time, he made his debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, replenishing the film&#39;s treasury by 3.6 million.
The top three this time was closed by the children&#39;s fairy tale &quot;The Secret of the House with a Clock&quot; from the horror master Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director can make high-quality films for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the adaptation of John Bellairs&#39; book with the adorable Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide to $53.8 million.
Despite the departure from the top 3, the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick &quot;A Simple Favor&quot; continues to amaze with the &quot;+&quot; sign: for 17 days in the American box office, the picture of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not initially expected from the word &quot;absolutely&quot;, raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million in total revenue.
The last member of the top five this week was the horror film The Nun, which grossed $5.4 million during the reporting period.
The spin-off &quot;The Conjuring&quot; following the results of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has on its account $ 330 million in total earnings and, more recently, proudly bears the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of &quot;The Conjuring&quot; itself. and two tapes about the creepy Annabelle doll.
Right after the horror movie by Corin Hardy, following the results of the past weekend, there is another representative of the genre - the debutant &quot;Hellfest&quot;, one of the main youth horror films of the year.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of acclaimed editor (and more recently director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including Happy Death Day, which Hellfest bears a strong resemblance to in places, earned $5.1 million in the US.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh was Crazy Rich Asians ($4.15 million), which does not seem to think of dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for the seventh week, is the sixth highest grossing in September genre tapes in history with a figure of 165.7 million.
It is this amount that the picture has currently earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million rubles.
As for the last three lucky winners who hit the top ten in terms of fees in the US for September 28-30, they were &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;White Boy Rick&quot; and ... &quot;Crimson Mint&quot;, which earned $ 3.7 million over the past weekend, respectively, 2.38 million and 1.1 million
We add that already next weekend in the USA the long-awaited &quot;Venom&quot; with Tom Hardy will be gathering with might and main, which - there is no doubt about it - without any problems will take the lead in the American box office following the results of the first weekend of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical-melodrama A Star Is Born, winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama Your Hate.

Valery Belov: God helped Sibir today
Vityaz head coach Valery Belov speaks about the defeat from Sibir (3:4) in the KHL regular season match.
“A colleague was talking about the fans of Siberia, and I want to mention our fans,” Belov quotes the official website of Vityaz as saying.
“Hopefully they will support the same, because now the stadium is full almost every game, it’s a great atmosphere.
According to the game, probably, the Lord helped Sibir today, because it was very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro-match 0:3, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
However, I will still take the blame.
Because, apparently, they missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an ugly nepotism&quot;
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show &quot;Voice&quot;
Spectators of the show &quot;Voice 60+&quot; accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of &quot;ugly nepotism and impudent fraud.&quot;
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor for bias at the first stage.
But the &quot;joke&quot; dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were indignant at the nepotism, the ugly and outright dragging of our close relatives onto the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the very end to the first place, &quot;Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program&quot; Man from TV &quot;.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin &quot;leaked&quot; wonderful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience would continue to want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
&quot;I sympathize with the participants of the &quot;Voice&quot; from Agutin&#39;s team - they were doomed.&quot;
&quot;Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself to be a professional.&quot;
&quot;The competition has lost its meaning.&quot;
&quot;Remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can you name a mentor after that?&quot;,
&quot;I like how dad sings, organize a concert for him in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert.&quot;
This is the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
&quot;It was unprofessional on Agutin&#39;s part.&quot;
&quot;Then you need to offer your dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show that is done for the money of Channel 1.&quot;
&quot;It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone&#39;s place.
And I don&#39;t understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other member with real vocal abilities.
Why was a worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merged, and Agutin&#39;s father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because you can’t break through nepotism!
&quot;What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
All around blat and nepotism.
Yes, and money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of the absurd continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional &quot;Voice&quot; Gradsky&#39;s son came out on blind auditions.
Then it never occurred to the meter to take his son to his own team.
Moreover, he said: &quot;Come on, get out of here, everything is clear.&quot;
Agutin could not act like a professional.

In Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction
From tomorrow in Russia they will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction, the channel &quot;Russia 24&quot; reports.
Punishment threatens companies and officials if they do not transfer data about the house under construction to the Unified Housing Construction Information System in time.
The innovation will help those who decide to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the bankruptcy of the developer.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to take full credit from the bank.
And many experts have already started talking about a possible strong rise in prices for apartments.
But as it turned out, not everyone agrees with this.

The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the expedition of the Russian Federation to the moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible scientific research program for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing directions for such work.
&quot;There is no consolidated opinion yet,&quot; the scientist stressed.
He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
&quot;This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic sources of radio emission,&quot; Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth&#39;s satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos corporation said that in an optimistic scenario, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumped faeces basket at 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, had a grudge against a 7-Eleven convenience store manager who kicked him out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past one in the morning, he went into the store and dumped the contents of the basket he had brought with him on the floor and on some of the goods located on the shelves.
The basket contained faeces and urine that Simms &quot;borrowed&quot; from a nearby mobile dry closet.
Arriving at the scene, the police arrested the &quot;avenger&quot;.
He was jailed and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and misdemeanor charges, and was banned from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms&#39; crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the sentence could be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law in the past: grand theft, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, drunk driving and cruelty to animals are listed. .

There were two teams that had two defeats before this meeting.
Came out &quot;on the teeth&quot;.
The special team played well, scoring two goals.
It can be seen that the guys have a very large psychological burden.
They are in a hurry to complete attacks, so it doesn&#39;t work.
You have to go through this time and move on.
- German Mikhailovich, how do you like Erofeev&#39;s game?
- You know, I really liked the game.
Emotional, nothing more, as we asked.
He climbed on the goal and created chances, as in the episode with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he did not score into an empty net.
Very impressive for a first game.
I think that we will involve him in the games further.

There was nothing I could do and it hurt a lot
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn&#39;t do anything, and it was very painful
The Russian pilot of “Williams” Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I was between two cars that immediately squeezed me.
I lost all those positions that I won back at the start, in a moment, right away.
I was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of the pit stops, we will get into the &quot;clean air&quot; and the pace will return, but there was no rubber.
Plus, I fought with my partner, I also had contact with him.
As I understand it, he made a mistake.
We found ourselves in such a situation on the most non-passing track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” RIA Novosti quoted Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin finished 18th in the race at the Russian Grand Prix, the winner was the British driver of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the basis of Spartak absurd
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of the players of the Moscow &quot;Spartak&quot; Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yeshchenko from training with the main team after liking the criticism of the team&#39;s head coach Massimo Carrera, Sport Weekend reports.
Carrera&#39;s actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is utter stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
Firstly, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
If I were Carrera, I would not have reacted to this in any way.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to dress up.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko put likes, this does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartak has no game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartak has a lot of things wrong in different lines, there is a lack of teamwork after being introduced to the youth team.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match,&quot; Tarpishchev is sure.
The game between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously denied &quot;Spartacus&quot; John Terry led the youth team of &quot;Chelsea&quot;.
Pupils of &quot;Sirius&quot; discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the educational center &quot;Sirius&quot; in Sochi, participants of the School of agrobiology and plant genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center &quot;Kurchatov Institute&quot;.
The presentation of the researchers took place as part of the program of the Global International Forum of Converging and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary &quot;Kurchatov&#39;s Codes&quot;, during which Mikhail Kovalchuk, President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, spoke about global challenges as the driving force behind the development of civilization.
The scientist&#39;s lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Schoolchildren learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today, will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal boon.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, this is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a downside - targeted intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I am creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction,&quot; REN TV quotes the scientist.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
The speakers were Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-nature-like technologies of the National Research Center &quot;Kurchatov Institute&quot; Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early detection, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the All-Russian online competition in information security Cyberchallenge would be sent to study at Sirius.

&quot;We face a tough potential adversary.
It is enough just to look at Severodvinsk,&quot; he said, pointing to Kazan&#39;s predecessor model.
According to James Foggo, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy in Europe, Russia has focused its efforts on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to &quot;North Macedonia&quot;.
Greece objected to the use of the name of their historical province by the Macedonians.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic a path to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the turnout at the Sunday plebiscite &quot;did not reach&quot; the constitutional threshold of 50%.
At the same time, since the referendum was only advisory, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the republic&#39;s name change, said that if there were more &quot;yes&quot; among the votes cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the quorum not reached.

Kemerovo residents outraged by a herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovo page on the social network, a message appeared from an eyewitness that horned animals roam freely in one of the local cemeteries.
Animals in a considerable herd walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the area from weeds and grass thickets, however, some of the residents of the city did not have to soul:
&quot;These are graves, not pastures.
There is nothing for sheep to do there.
About rams, of course, you can’t say that they blaspheme, but still this is not the case.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Press and press - how to?
The word press does not exist.
That&#39;s right - crush.
The word &quot;pressure&quot; in the meaning of &quot;gravitate, influence, influence&quot; exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word &quot;press&quot;.
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word &quot;pressure&quot;.
But &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;pressure&quot; are etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
See for yourself.
To prevail (church.-bookish, obsolete) means &quot;quite, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy.&quot;
To be content, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning &quot;not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient value&quot; - &quot;to satisfy oneself.&quot;
Old Slavonic &quot;please&quot; is related to the words &quot;command&quot; and &quot;will&quot;.
To crush, to suppress - completely different.
These words have really frightening &quot;relatives&quot;: daos - &quot;wolf&quot; (crushing sheep), deyja - &quot;to die&quot; and dvaidī - &quot;oppress&quot;.
The similar phonetic appearance of the words &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;pressure&quot;, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we got this very “d[a] to fly in”, which is also used in writing through “a”, which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, right - to dominate.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word &quot;push&quot;.
You can also use the &quot;apply pressure&quot; construction, but remember that this is clerical.

Our car is noticeably slower than the Mercedes.
Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen on qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix, following which he finished fourth.
&quot;Kimi, did you have a chance to take pole today?
How well did the car behave?
“It looks like the Mercedes were much faster today,” F1News.Ru quoted Raikkonen as saying.
But the behavior of our car was the best since the beginning of the weekend.&quot;
“In the course of qualifying, you were not inferior in speed to Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the gap still turned out to be noticeable.
What is the reason?&quot;
“My attempt was going well, but then one of the Mercedes drivers was in front.
He prepared for the attempt and still managed to let me through, but it looks like I lost some time on this.
However, this is unlikely to have much effect on the result.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult to overtake in Sochi, will the start of the race be a key moment?&quot;
“Probably yes, but you never know how things will turn out.
It won&#39;t be easy anyway, because our car is noticeably slower than the Mercedes cars.&quot;

Volunteers work here along with the rescuers.
One of them says that he helped save three people and heard the voices of those who have not yet been reached: “We tried to cheer them up so that they would not lose heart, although they were trapped between life and death.
They must be there in complete darkness, without light, but we could only support them with words...
I am a simple volunteer and I want only one thing - to save lives

A friendly person gave the baby an exclusive parking
Miracles do happen in our lives!
German journalist Christie Dietz tweeted about one of them.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son parked his balance bike (children&#39;s bike without pedals) near the same lamppost all year long.
And one morning, a nice sticker appeared on the pole with a photo of a green bike and the inscription: &quot;Only for him.&quot;
The delight of mother and baby knew no bounds.
Christy thanked the anonymous well-wisher and praised him for his interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made many people smile.
The comments were also great:
&quot;How wonderful it is!&quot;
&quot;Thank you for the wonderful fellowship in this world.&quot;
&quot;I think there are many people in the world capable of such an act.&quot;
&quot;Unfortunately, they do not attract the same attention as the antics of villains.&quot;
&quot;This is the World we need!&quot;
Readers asked the journalist, if suddenly she still manages to find out who was the author of this idea, to tell about it.
After all, this man, apparently, is somewhere nearby: he has repeatedly watched the baby park, since such a thing occurred to him.

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state duty in the amount of 200 rubles.
This is reported by &quot;Ural Meridian&quot;.
In mid-September, the relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan bailiffs&#39; department, informing them that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.
According to the court&#39;s verdict, the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax office.
After receiving the letter, relatives of Slepneva turned to the department for clarification.
The Department of Bailiffs promised to deal with the situation.
Social media users, having learned about the incident, advised relatives to file counterclaims for non-payment of pensions and social benefits to the old woman for the years &quot;lived&quot; after her death.

His full namesake should have been marked dead, but they mistakenly made the entry to the wrong person.

Vucic upheld the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army
Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić ordered that the highest level of combat readiness, which the country&#39;s Armed Forces were brought to, be maintained due to the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.
&quot;The president has ordered that the highest level of combat readiness be maintained, and there will be a separate order to cancel it,&quot; Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin said on Sunday, quoted by TASS.

According to reports, the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and should take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace, and noted that he would like his country to be a peaceful, economically successful country of the future.

Refugees and migrants should not be considered different, and migration itself is the mother of this society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racist organizations sent an open letter to the minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists destroyed the Aerospace Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the Aerospace Forces, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons from the air: Aerospace Forces delivered and continue to deliver all strikes precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria over the past three years - we are talking, for example, about ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadist defenses were hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about 4,000 militants from among Russian citizens and about 5,000 citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of IS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise this evil &quot;would have gushed to us.&quot;
Phones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers were exposed to the public
The personal data of a number of former and current British ministers were exposed to the public due to a security failure in the application created by the Conservative Party, reports Sky News.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond and former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were made available.
According to the channel, several politicians received &quot;unpleasant calls&quot;.
The technical issue has been resolved and the application is now safe to use.
We are investigating the cause of the failure and apologize for any problems caused,&quot; the Conservative Party said in a statement.
During the failure, users could not only see sensitive data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
So, in the profile of the Minister for the Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his photo was replaced with a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accuses US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it targeted, it has massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law,&quot; he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided &quot;direct support to the terrorists,&quot; since the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied &quot;sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path.&quot;
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost completed, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of Warring Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft attacked the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus ammunition.
The US has denied all allegations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state stated this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of Hungary&#39;s passports in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am protecting the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,&quot; Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Berehove.
&quot;I fully share every letter that was said by the Foreign Ministry,&quot; the President noted.
As FAKTY reported, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment when Ukrainian citizens were issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary aloud.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears in the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor&#39;s office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing Hungarian passports.
The incident is qualified under the article &quot;Treason.&quot;
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian &quot;board number 1&quot; on the Flightradar website indicates that at about 6 pm Tajik time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the plane&#39;s transponder was switched off.
The direction of its flight suggests that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 agency, the president was personally met in Abakan on the night of September 29 by the head of the region, Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the site&#39;s sources believe that the real reason is &quot;the problem of the second round.&quot;
Next Sunday in Khakassia, the second round of elections for the head of the region should take place.
Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the incumbent head of the republic Viktor Zimin (United Russia) entered it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrey Filyagin (&quot;Fair Russia&quot;) should take part in the upcoming round along with Konovalov.
The Khakass media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president&#39;s favorite vacation spots.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, speaking at the UN: &quot;At present, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict must be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in dieselgate in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group&#39;s losses are estimated at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June next year, the automaker is required to buy back or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company&#39;s management announced that the obligations had already been fulfilled in relation to 83% of the cars, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
&quot;Volkswagen&quot; is trying with might and main to compensate for the losses and regain the trust of customers.
Thus, recently the management of the concern changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system were announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: the authorities received such a right in February this year.
Approaching typhoon paralyzes traffic in Japan
Japan Railways, Japan&#39;s largest railway operator, has announced the suspension of high-speed trains due to the approaching Typhoon Trami.
The restriction from 17:00 (from 11:00 Moscow time) will be extended to routes between the central region with the western and southwestern parts of the country.
Due to the approaching elements, the movement of regular buses running between the major cities of these regions and Tokyo will also be suspended.
Local television spoke about the cancellation of more than 1,126 flights at Japanese airports, the RIA Novosti agency clarifies on September 30.
The country&#39;s authorities also announced the suspension of the ferry service.
According to the main meteorological agency of the country, Trami is now located 90 km from the city of Miyazaki, on the island of Kyushu.
He was assigned the serial number 24.
The wind speed in the center of the typhoon is 45 m/s, with gusts of wind - up to 60 m/s.
Meteorologists qualify it as &quot;extremely strong&quot;.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kyiv&#39;s decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis against the Jews.
&quot;It&#39;s like putting a yellow pointed star on a Jew in fascist Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this very purpose,&quot; the metropolitan said on the air of the Russia-24 TV channel (quote from &quot; Interfax&quot;).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and &quot;put it outside the law,&quot; the clergyman believes.
&quot;This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,&quot; he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Viceroy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Volodymyr, the Vicegerent of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, issued an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in our history, Christians, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit, had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Considering the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something,&quot; the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the governor of the Lavra stressed that, probably, &quot;your physical presence will be needed.&quot;
The clergyman added: &quot;Lenin&#39;s grandchildren - in spirit, threaten with reprisal, and therefore we will protect our shrine.&quot;
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, must be ready to defend it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status, determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make Bartholomew the Catholic Pope dependent on the new-time patriarch and friend.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,&quot; the abbot of the Lavra noted.
He recalled that since October 1990 the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, our church already has Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?&quot; - said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves if other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers to some extent figured out and decided which temple they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are jealous that the domes on the temples that they want to destroy are shining,&quot; the clergyman emphasized.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

The socialite posted another sad post on Instagram, which angered her followers.
&quot;I never thought feelings could have a price.
Life still continues to teach me ... and when will I start to understand people, &quot;Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that in fact the singer &quot;didn&#39;t see real life.&quot;
&quot;You haven&#39;t suffered yet.
You cling to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family,&quot; wrote @nataliamama37.
There were also those who advised Buzova to turn to psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
&quot;Maybe you should read the literature on psychology?
What should I do in order not to play the victim?&quot; - wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were those who supported the singer.
&quot;Olya, you, most importantly, do not be upset.
Your man will not say big words all over the country and then just not follow them,&quot; @arina_prostyle supported Buzova.
&quot;You are a queen and you need a king, and the one who exchanged you for pieces of paper is simply not worthy of you.
Keep your nose up and move on,&quot; wrote @kreszentia_f.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and abandon Buzova by the fact that the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we continue to play the right way, the victories will come
Dynamo Moscow head coach Vladimir Vorobyov speaks about the defeat from Avtomobilist (0:1) in the KHL regular season match.
&quot;It was a good game, interesting, although it went all the way to the goal,&quot; Vorobyov&#39;s official website quoted Avtomobilist as saying.
&quot;We tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
Didn&#39;t use a few good points.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little, we held out.
But the deletions &quot;fed&quot; us a little.
The guys played great, carried out the coaching instructions.
I think if we continue to play well, the victories will come.
Not scored, games are not won with zero goals, but the content of the game itself was correct.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.&quot;
&quot;In your opinion, Avtomobilist added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?&quot;
&quot;Then the foreign link did not play.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other problems, many young guys played.
I think it was a completely different game, different hockey.
&quot;Motorist&quot; is a good solid team.
It is clear from the standings that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are many good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were ready.
We knew that the team was going unbeaten, we wanted to reverse it, but it didn’t work out.”

Main Macedonian oppositionist refuses to vote in referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is being held on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: &quot;Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?&quot;
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mickosky, said he would not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers &quot;harmful.&quot;
According to the press secretary, the current referendum decides the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in an independence referendum. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
&quot;A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created,&quot; Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes.
This agreement should resolve the longstanding dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje&#39;s path to NATO and the EU, recalls TASS.

In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission sent its experts to the region.

US happy with Afghan opiate production growth
A sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record year in terms of the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed,&quot; Patrushev said.
Afghanistan&#39;s troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan, was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
17 years have passed.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more illusory than then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money - as long as they are not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country&#39;s territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% belongs to ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing fast.
The goal is to create a barbarian pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
It also suits the fact that over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
A colossal increase in the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor&#39;s right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: &quot;Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises and cannot make absolutely everyone happy.&quot;
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have partnership relations with it: &quot;Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country .
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.&quot;
Fay Dulgheri, Euronews: &quot;The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.&quot;
