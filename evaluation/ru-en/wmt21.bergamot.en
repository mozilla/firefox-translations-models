Semilarski against prosecutors: the cassation of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances to consider the claim of Semilarski refused, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since her permission is not within his competence of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint contained a claim for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the county court should regulate such issues,” Anett Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu Courts, told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to the defender of Semilarski, a jury Oliver Nyaez, his client for about two years unreasonably was under suspicion of bribery.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the wrong allegations in his address and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor’s office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another Deputy Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu – one of the most influential bodies of local government – are corrupt.
These public suspicions hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to talk about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The claim of bribery and venal turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as in Lithuania, that at the investigative stage, state representatives should be careful when choosing words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is also obliged to do so with the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Nääs said.
“The public submission of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly against the applicant,” the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed against him in July.
At the same time, the former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated in the meetings of the city government more than thirty times in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or leaders of which Semilarski actively communicated at the personal level outside of the time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to distance himself from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor’s office presented Semilarski suspected of receiving a bribe and violating the anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then the prosecutor’s office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia expectedly again reduced the key rate.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step of the rate cut, as well as the tone of the statements of the Central Bank and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of easing monetary policy may soon stop.
“We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily taking into account that the risks of inflation deviations down from 4% in 2021 still remain,” said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were restored, the annual rate of decrease in cargo turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (before that, 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s forecast for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
So, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point due to the low rate of inflation due to the suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has stirred due to the pandemic and the associated restrictions.
The chances of conding of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The set of pro-inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of the pause in easing interest policy - disrupted supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top up the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, by the mortgage, senior economist of the analytical department of the Bank “Opening” Maxim Petronevich.

Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, the economist of BCS Premier Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they can fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4%, if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, says Pokatovich.

Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the company of sociological research Vilmorus to order the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margins of error, and yet the rulings stopped lagging behind the conservatives.

In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which is now ready to vote for 7.1% of respondents.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the workshop, which took place today, on July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agrarian territories.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-ORDynsky Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported their execution.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the delivery of the building is 2022.
And this year should be commissioned a school in the village of Bayandai.
The decoration of the premises has now been completed.
Of the remaining works - the improvement of the territory.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your county.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we must create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the work on the development of general planning of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution of milk by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the place, study the structure of the sale of milk, analyze the experience of other territories and determine the solutions to the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the field are being modernized in modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for each landfill - many of them have overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the polygon is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soils, degassing and infiltrate withdrawal systems are mounted.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not exude stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to rise a useless bunch of residential buildings that set it.
Why not make it useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill has ended just the other day, the authorities are considering the option to make a heap a ski slope.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto for long overwhelmed by garbage.
“Some time will pass, the polygon will “sit down”, will gain strength, and we will think what can be done so that it begins to benefit.
Directly catches the eye - the ski resort, "- told reporters the head of the Ruzsky district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two sites will become renewable energy facilities
The Torbeevo ranges in Lyubertsy and Tymokhovo in the Bogorodsky district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet its own needs of the landfill - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
"Timokhovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino", which was closed after the complaints of residents on the "Seak line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills of the Moscow region," - said the deputy chairman of the government - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia-Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - the text of Voldimir Zelinsky was caught, which, they say, should be protested.
First, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I haven’t been to Istanbul, but it’s better to enter the House of God than a paid entrance.
Secondly, the Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Ok interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in Grozny) and landed apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered the American.
Are we going to get everyone back?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which the Tithe Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it is theirs as well as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and the other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so that it’s all of them by the right of the progressors.
Beautiful high minarets adorned Ayia-Sofia very much, very.
There was a silly inkwell, became a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are prudes, uniting faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of a British Foreign Office Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And the faithful everywhere the place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're koloboks, not gloomy stones.

The authors “understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “Rise”.

It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the boy’s father, who changed into women’s clothes.
He stressed that he is “probable to work” and does not consider it propaganda.
