India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation agreement between the two states.
FASO Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO of Russia), together with the Russian Academy of Sciences, will hold the third Expert Session &quot;Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations.&quot;
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release received by the editors of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the work of the Expert Session for the year and form the final list of indicators for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is being approved.
Based on the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,&quot; said Elena Aksenova, Head of the Expert and Analytical Department of the FASO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes in Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will make it possible to search for related stars among the stars, that is, those that have arisen from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and a brief summary of them can be found on the university website.
The reason for the similar chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that precedes the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of relative stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical abundance from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of simulations carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two flows of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object over several million years, under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added paint markers to the initial gas streams and found that a high degree of chemical uniformity was achieved due to the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for relative stars by chemical composition, as well as determine possible regions for the formation of such objects.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after chasing motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed limit zone and through bushland to escape police in the Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karrat this morning attempted to stop a blue motorcycle after finding it traveling at 125 km/h as it exited a service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued down Burgess Road, then turned into bushland, causing police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver&#39;s description were seen outside a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police charged the 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the Karratha Magistrates&#39; Court on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The academic year in the DPR will not begin until October
On September 1, the school year in the DPR will not begin, since there are only 10% of children in the region.
This was announced by the Minister of Education and Science of the self-proclaimed republic Igor Kostenok.
According to him, 11% of schoolchildren went to other regions of Ukraine, 20% - to Russia.
Education in schools in the territory controlled by the DPR will not begin until October 1.
However, teachers will return to work on September 1st.
Investigation of TU-204 crash at Vnukovo in 2012 completed
The Investigative Committee of Russia has completed a criminal investigation into the crash of a TU-204 aircraft at Vnukovo Airport in December 2012.
This was reported today in the RF IC.
&quot;The Moscow Interregional Investigation Department for Transport of the Investigative Committee of Russia completed the investigation of a criminal case initiated on the fact of the crash of a TU-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline at Vnukovo Airport on December 29, 2012, on the grounds of a crime under part 3 of article 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation / violation of the rules of traffic safety and operation of air transport, which negligently caused the death of two or more persons /&quot;, the ministry said in a statement.
The cause of the disaster was the failure of the crew to comply with standard procedures and an increased approach speed.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, is charged during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was &quot;unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent.&quot;
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, which is located in the Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has set a High Court hearing in Edinburgh for 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not &quot;slam the door&quot; in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not &quot;slam the door&quot; on new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I won’t even argue, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will be worthy of this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be connected with slamming doors, some insults, falsely understood, - the minister emphasized.
First of all, we will proceed from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners regarding their adequacy, negotiability and reliability.
By the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, one can very well judge what the partners are striving for, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If they say out loud that &quot;these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do this in order to punish Russia,&quot; this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe are discriminatory EU anti-dumping policies.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are being applied against the sectors of the Russian economy.
&quot;We are ready to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the EU&#39;s third energy package retrospectively,&quot; Lavrov said.
How to use lilac in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers questions:
Since lilac loses its main attractiveness after flowering, it is advisable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
Moreover, next to the lilac, it is possible and necessary to plant both plants that are decorative at other times, and blooming at the same time as it.
Another plus of lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a standard tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a semblance of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best suits your garden design.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for the sale of counterfeit money
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal trade in the Olonetsky and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to leave a legacy in the Vologda region, where this spring he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezha.
During the investigation, guilt was proved in several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with serving in a penal colony.
The verdict has not entered into force.
It should be reminded that last week two more distributors of counterfeit money were convicted, who paid with them in the stores of Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan came to Karelia also from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet entered into force.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy &quot;Dervish&quot; was celebrated in Arkhangelsk
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
&quot;Dervish&quot; delivered military aid from the USA and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial meeting was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants in the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today&#39;s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not returned by the sea,&quot; said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Shipping Company.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and pupils of the cadet classes presented the veterans with flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers at the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool, and a host of other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board the ships - 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy was 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
In total, out of 848 ships that took part in vital caravan operations, 126 transport and about 50 warships perished.

Next year, its participants plan to exhibit at the Russian level, the press service of the city administration reports.
Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect unionization as a civil right.
&quot;Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs,&quot; says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m proud to present the Workers Empowerment Act, along with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal options to discriminate against union organizing as they do to other forms of discrimination, stopping anti-union forces
Changing the Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for organizing unions to seek justice in civil courts - and receive damages and penalties - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the bill&#39;s co-sponsors are proposing is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have come under in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country pass a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo&#39;s paramilitary autocracy was replaced by a democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions have a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included text that explicitly recognized that &quot;the right of workers to organize and to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed.&quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler&#39;s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that explicitly stated: &quot;The right to form associations for the purpose of protecting and improving working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe on this right will be null and void; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chair of the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that &quot;everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests.&quot;
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and for this union to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as we should.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the expansion of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against union organizing - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are resurrecting the ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks legislation that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the US, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the passage of a Louisiana law that its supporters say would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Ginadle in June and due to take effect September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have admittance to hospitals within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge&#39;s decision means doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being while continuing to seek such authority.
&quot;Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate legally while continuing to act to obtain credentials,&quot; Judge John deGravells wrote in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within the month in which the judge makes a more permanent ruling on this law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital credentials.
&quot;Today&#39;s decision ensures that Louisiana women are protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,&quot; said Nancy Northup, president and director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to physicians from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in this case and also applied for admittance authority.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would shut down most of the state&#39;s remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights activists, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws place restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are intended to protect women&#39;s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not penalize abortion doctors as long as their applications for admissions authority are pending.
What will the introduction of quotas on domestic products lead to?
At least half of the products for each type of product in the assortment of retail chains should be Russian-made, said Oleg Nilov, State Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the Izvestia newspaper writes.
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. &lt;...&gt; For the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers,&quot; Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article &quot;On the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trading Activities in the Russian Federation&quot;, the draft law provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of products manufactured in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the stimulus package for Russian manufacturers.
Several times more domestic goods will appear on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company &quot;Nalogovik&quot;, a member of the independent expert center &quot;Public Duma&quot; Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
In the black will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to scale up their operations and sales, which will result in higher taxes being paid than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will develop faster, and will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia&#39;s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, though not immediately,&quot; the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been vacated and we can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now there is a &quot;moment of calm&quot; when the old players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products,&quot; said Tamara Kasyanova, First Vice-President of the all-Russian public organization &quot;Russian Club of Financial Directors&quot;, Ph.
Definitely, the idea to sell at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow the sector to be secured to local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper due to subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are far from being able to satisfy 50% of their compatriots&#39; domestic needs in all respects.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to &quot;reach out&quot; the share of Russian goods to half of the assortment.
In this regard, fears are growing that low-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of those produced in Russia,&quot; the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large retail chains, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in this situation, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported counterparts, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter, as for a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February of this year due to the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of refusing imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is intended to oblige retailers to take into account domestic manufacturers when placing orders with suppliers.
Then we will follow the path of import substitution much faster and more confidently, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time,&quot; MP Oleg Nilov says.
The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also receive a powerful impetus.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still falls on Russian products,&quot; Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, by itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full-fledged import substitution will not occur, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas; it is also necessary to organize the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees,&quot; the expert states.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean more ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those who live in cities.
The researchers analyzed the charts of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that just 35 percent lived five years after they were diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research said that those who live in the regions and outlying areas of the state are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who live in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women&#39;s medical path for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said a woman&#39;s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current medical conditions, and socioeconomic status also affected survival.
Older women and those with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regions or outlying areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women who live outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
&quot;This disease is best treated by surgeons who specialize in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in big cities,&quot; she said.
While improving telehealth services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing outreach services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people receiving treatment away from home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer funded study will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaybelyak began in April this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of the work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the constructed medical institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the village of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncherumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new feldsher-obstetric station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
Novocheboksarka who killed her four-month-old son while intoxicated will stand trial
A resident of Chuvashia will be on trial for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, a criminal investigation has been completed against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation established that on July 26 of this year, the accused, along with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her godfather&#39;s child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the Novocheboksar woman decided to stay and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
While sleeping, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Investigative Committee of the ICR for Chuvashia, has been sent to court.
Inflation is out of the holiday.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts at VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, and even less next year - 6.5%.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the Ministry of Economic Development should make &quot;small but fundamental&quot; adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of income growth.
The forecast assumed that Russia&#39;s food sanctions would be in effect for a year, until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change,&quot; a source in the Finance Ministry said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic bloc of the government regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflation will peak at 9% in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after the Russian Federation introduced &quot;neat sanctions.&quot;
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex FC:
The rise in prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiate price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had been kept under control, the cost of the minimum basket of food would not have jumped 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are unable to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of an increase in the inflationary component.
If we add here the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsened prospects for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of the analytical department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in the 2000s it was also higher than the current level, but it is another matter that at that time this was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Asset Manager of Managing Company &quot;Maguta Fund&quot;
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has been successfully contained so far, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector, this may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which usually traditionally manifest themselves in purchases of cash currency in order to to secure your savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer lull and, perhaps, this fall will become more noticeable.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to survive, since the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Horticultural centers grieve over declining number of homeowners
Such a drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could see gardening centers lose tens of millions of pounds a year as today&#39;s young consumers reach the &quot;basic gardening age,&quot; according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend, on average, 55 percent of what homeowners spend on gardening.
It cites the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting front yards for parking and shrinking gardens as other threats to an industry estimated to generate £5 billion in annual sales.
Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, has the UK&#39;s lowest level of spending on gardening supplies per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have said that renting a house and not having space for a garden doesn&#39;t mean people can&#39;t grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at the RHS, said: &quot;Growing plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.&quot;
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot;golden age&quot; of horticulture retail, as a result of an increase in homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a massive purge in the Fund &quot;Agriculture&quot;
Three of the four heads of the &quot;Agriculture&quot; fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the &quot;Agriculture&quot; fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria announced only the dismissal of Atanas Dobrev, the executive director.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were also quietly replaced on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who until then was in charge of state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, BGNES reports with reference to the Trud newspaper.
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund, because by law we are not members of the management, but I was informed later that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not announced on the foundation&#39;s website.
I am on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday,&quot; Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of Investment Lending at the central fund in Agriculture in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Up to this point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
He will be replaced by Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the &quot;Agriculture&quot; fund in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atije Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
She is currently in charge of the Rural Development Program.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Türkiye Summons US Diplomat Over Spy Report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called the country&#39;s most senior US diplomat for clarification on a report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d&#39;affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and the online magazine &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey has been a priority intelligence target for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany&#39;s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target drew a more angry response from the Turkish government.
Biggest Chinese Companies Team Up Against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China&#39;s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China&#39;s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register a company in Hong Kong.
The JV will combine Baidu&#39;s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) to build a film studio and theme park in Qingdao, a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea.
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring in $960 million in revenue.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be developed by the emerging rival Alibaba.
Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year, according to Dong Ce, who will lead the new company.
The new site should become the world&#39;s largest online-to-offline platform, said Dong Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
Coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru are a classic example of O2O.
&quot;O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce,&quot; said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin (Bloomberg cited).
&quot;Currently, there is no real O2O platform in China, and in this situation, everyone&#39;s chances are approximately equal,&quot; he said.
China&#39;s e-commerce market is the largest in the world and McKinsey &amp; Co. estimates it will more than triple by 2015 from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, Bloomberg cites official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng was China&#39;s richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma&#39;s net worth is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes from his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu chief Robin Li is now the third richest person in China, while Wanda&#39;s Wang Jianlin is fourth.
&quot;This battle is very exciting to watch as the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,&quot; Cao Lei, director of China&#39;s Hangzhou e-commerce research center, told Bloomberg.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation: &quot;Rome cannot be built in one day.&quot;
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for the deserved leaders of global e-commerce, is evidenced by the report on Alibaba&#39;s financial performance for the last quarter, published the day before.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its US rivals combined.
Alibaba&#39;s net income for the period is almost double that of its peers, up nearly three times year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
&quot;Alibaba still has huge potential for generating money, thanks in large part to its mobile apps,&quot; an analyst at Hong Kong&#39;s Arete Research Service told Bloomberg.
According to Alibaba&#39;s updated prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company&#39;s services in July was 188 million, which significantly exceeds the March figure of 163 million people.
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
Alibaba&#39;s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16, according to Bloomberg sources.
The road-show of the company preceding this event starts on September 3rd.
Alibaba&#39;s IPO is expected to be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
Until now, the record for the volume of funds raised on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held an initial public offering of its shares, earning $17.9 billion from it.
At least half of the food products in retail chains should be Russian-made, State Duma deputies believe.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
It is about amending Art. 8 of the Federal Law &quot;On the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation&quot; and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so a &quot;discount&quot; will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products whose country of origin is Russia, the Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law amending the Federal Law &quot;On Retail Markets&quot; was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers&#39; markets in Russia, where small producers can sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous center of rampant drinking, Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been taken into custody following allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials from the Municipality of Calvia to the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#39;s Office of Mallorca on Friday.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with allegations of corruption and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say government protectionism is taking a toll on their business.
&quot;It&#39;s not about making money anymore, it&#39;s about surviving,&quot; one of the businessmen told the court.
We must not jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker giving blowjobs to 24 men during a bar run.
The island&#39;s authorities have since been trying to stop drunken disorderly behavior among Magaluf&#39;s holidaymakers by minimizing the number of infamous bar runs.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage Bar Run organizers together were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
Mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, the tourist resort of Magaluf has also been the site of numerous drunken accidents related to the crazy game known as &quot;balconing&quot;, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
First day of spring marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has a cold surprise in the south of South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The latest rain was preceded by a couple of short downpours with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that started just before 8pm and poured nearly 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squally conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m. on schedule, but hit a wind shear—a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance—and was forced to climb.
Wind gusts were reaching 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to climb during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay on this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A high of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday with a chance of one or two showers.
The calculation of estimates for construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connecting to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
An expert council for the development of competition in the construction industry has been established under the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
At its meeting, Vadim Solovyov, head of the department for control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, said that &quot;today&#39;s calculation of estimates for construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible.&quot;
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, according to the FAS.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals have been included in the &quot;road map&quot; and are now under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.
&quot;Replacing traditional estimate documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,&quot; Vadim Solovyov explained to RSL.
Indeed, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, therefore sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury &quot;whole tractors&quot; in the documentation.
The Ministry of Construction agrees with the FAS.
“The first developments on the transition to cost calculation by structural elements are already in place: methods have been developed for calculating prices for structural solutions, drawing up estimates for these indicators,” Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Construction, told RSL.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot project.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
Anatoly Demyanko, the head of the construction company Profi-invest, told RGB that the estimated standards are outdated long ago, but no other mechanism has yet been offered to business.
&quot;As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings,&quot; he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to government orders.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, chairman of the board of the NP &quot;Expert community of state order professionals&quot;, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director for Engineering at Rosatom’s Industry Center for Capital Construction, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone&#39;s control influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state orders in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case, it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the customer&#39;s staffing level and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer&#39;s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, this breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of the site as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to lack of interest in obtaining a state order for an incomplete scope of work and a small contract amount.
Alexander Yevstashenkov, deputy head of the Expert Advisory Center of the Procurement Institute, believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the contractor&#39;s attentiveness.
And he gave such an example: &quot;when filling out the application, the participant must indicate&quot; specific indicators &quot;without specifying the words: &quot;or equivalent&quot;, &quot;should be&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;analogue&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;similar type&quot;, &quot;not lower&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;higher&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;may have&quot;, &quot;may be&quot;, &quot;earlier&quot;, &quot;not earlier&quot;, &quot;not higher&quot;, &quot;not allowed&quot;, etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Yevstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the participant&#39;s &quot;paper&quot; proposal even at the stage of filing an application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even been started yet, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed upon acceptance.
It was also proposed at the expert council to shift marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors disappear.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovskiy believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the well-known reprise of Arkady Raikin&#39;s &quot;Atelier&quot;: &quot;Do you have any complaints about the buttons?&quot;
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the area was recovering from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-hit communities in southern Israel, but the marks of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh Kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed debris from the walls and slides before the students arrived.
&quot;We&#39;re a little scared, but we&#39;re looking forward to the future,&quot; said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was &quot;a little weird&quot; to suddenly start going to school again.
&quot;It was a difficult time and we didn&#39;t leave our homes at all,&quot; she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before a ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of people in border settlements like Sa&#39;d stayed out or fled their homes to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine fragment, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools during this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza that has been badly damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said: &quot;We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.&quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas&#39;s demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of whom three-quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, he did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands still in shelters and fighting going on, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
&quot;I hope the school opens soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,&quot; said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
By popular yardstick, real estate prices posted their biggest winter rise in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 percent for June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12-month increase to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data director of research Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney have risen 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen 11.7 percent.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five to six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hit by government spending cuts, where prices rose just 1.4 percent for the year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a &quot;real test&quot; for the market.
&quot;Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate environment, it is likely that home values will rise further over the next three months,&quot; he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
There are 18 apartments in the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution Street 57/1 (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya).
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since its construction, except for dilapidation.
Outsiders go here as if on a tour, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
An old courtyard, an always open door, a creaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in places through the gaps from the peeling plaster.
Everything seems to be based on honesty.
And the locals assure: &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s true.&quot;
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is under state protection, but no money has been allocated for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum pieces that the authorities have simply forgotten about.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still somehow holding up, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet outside and wash themselves once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road passes right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatyana pushes back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only audible before: a stream of cars rushing under the windows.
You see, the windows rattle all the time, we can’t open the windows, but we’re used to the noise.
A person gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, the three of us live with our son.
And other families have much worse conditions; on the second floor, the ceilings are generally a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit her neighbor from apartment No. 6, Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the doorway offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m² for four people, and we live like this: my husband and I and my daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila looks around the room: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter &quot;g&quot;; on one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very crowded and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, &quot;historical&quot;.
But it regularly flows from the ceiling: the plumbing system is no good.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment in a casual and surprising way, like an Italian whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a nook and a toilet from a former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lodged, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says that privatization does not matter.
All the same, we will get only a one-room apartment, we cannot claim more.
Already four months ago they promised to resettle us, but things did not go further than promises.
I&#39;m not used to complaining and I won&#39;t.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment (room!): my grandparents, mom and dad, me and my husband, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened during this time.
For example, hefty rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed with eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house was built thoroughly, thanks to the Demidovs!
This is probably the only reason so far no one has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like into a well.
They say it is - under our room there is a secret hole and a passage to the Belaya River, which the Old Believers who once lived here specially made so that they could hide from danger, in which case.
They were being pursued.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them and begged them to let him start excavations in the apartment.
And then he urged them to give them a living space in exchange for his odnushka on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are we four in one?
And here there is at least a tiny hope that they will give more spacious housing.
If we had agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the Starostin family did not win anything.
Lyudmila&#39;s biggest dream is to be resettled, and her daughter and her 16-year-old granddaughter are given a separate room.
That is, two families were allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins in which two generations live now.
Pretty, petite girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two cramped little rooms with a total area of 23 m², called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
The plaster is falling off in pieces, as are the window frames, there are through holes in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms.
The tap water is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can see that the Lavrentievs from apartment No. 4 were the most fortunate.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the ground floor.
You are right, there are many places!
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live just in those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One thing is bad - everything around is bursting at the seams, falling apart, collapsing.
The neighbors must have already told you!
We have the most torment with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally left from under our feet.
I put props, wedges; there is nothing in the hall yet, but in the other room we walk, as if we are swinging on a swing, everything is so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any guide.
He treats the gold miner as if he were his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was outstanding: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, and kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables and guard houses around, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they also wanted to clean our house, but something got in the way ...
History repeated itself in 2014: again they beckoned with new housing.
We, as if on command, collected all the documents, ran around the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don&#39;t believe in any of this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent them from one table to another, and then, as if in mockery, they gave out a piece of paper without a signature and a seal: &quot;The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the resettlement of the tenants.&quot;
I even got the feeling that our house has long been gone from the city plan, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
Looks like it was demolished in the 70s.
&quot;Russian Planet&quot; turned to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the Department of Land Resources of Ufa, Vladimir Barabash.
The house on October Revolution Street 57/1 is included in the program for the resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, I only know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on October Revolution Street, which are of architectural value - is being successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice will restore the Demidov House.
Now an architectural biennale is taking place in Italy, and the project &quot;Old Ufa&quot; is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazanskaya Street will be restored,” the official says.
Houses will take on the proper form, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov&#39;s house is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level, a decision was made to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, there is too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Just from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorye due to a thunderstorm
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Okhotnichesky district forestry in the Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and means is being built up.
According to the leadership of the Primorskaya Air Base, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the Air Base:
The fire, which broke out in a remote area, was discovered by an observer pilot from the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood residues on an old burner.
The strong clutter of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire landing sites for paratroopers create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft at the disposal of the air base is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, 4 paratroopers-firefighters were promptly landed at the place of extinguishing.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the lunch area, an additional 3 paratroopers-firefighters were delivered by helicopter to the area of the village of Okhotnichiy.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be transferred to the extinguishing site, according to the website of the Primorsky Territory Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said &quot;I love you&quot;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrant parents at Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, which is loosely based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are upbeat.
However, Henry had to wade through some difficult childhood memories.
There has been &quot;a lot&quot; of treatment since his mother&#39;s death, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: &quot;Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of hitting cricket.
I never spoke to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions are better than in his father&#39;s days, he got a glimpse of what his life must have been like.
Now it&#39;s a little better there, but it&#39;s dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My dad would get in the tub and just lay there and you could hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he wanted to get away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn our living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, &quot;I love you.&quot;
Only when my mother became ill at the very end of her life did we begin to say: “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Dawn French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this &quot;I love you&quot;?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn&#39;t I be friends with her?
She is a great mom
They are still great friends with French, to whom he has been married for 25 years.
Don is a good person.
Why don&#39;t I be friends with Don?
She is a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really good and got diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, &quot;You need to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious fitness training, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It&#39;s very hard.
And it&#39;s boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry&#39;s change in career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his dignified, close-cropped beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theatre.
A Comedy of Errors followed, and then August Wilson&#39;s Fences.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral part of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed how he parodied on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies: &quot;For quite a long time I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television.&quot;
He studied on the job.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a TV star, and it was very hard.
Lenny in &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to the &quot;Black and White Minstrel Show,&quot; a light entertainment program in which people &quot;blackened their faces,&quot; Henry found himself performing on it for five years.
My family didn&#39;t like it very much.
I kind of wish this never happened to me, but I don&#39;t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in big venues and learned how to work with the crowd.
But what was &quot;an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years&quot; was also &quot;a grotesque parody of black people&quot;.
Representing characters that both mocked and sang about black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, television series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series &quot;LennyHenry.tv&quot;, he thought: &quot;What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little that you are playing for time or are slowly turning aside.
What followed was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called &quot;What&#39;s Good About...?&quot;
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can&#39;t say that I was really taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, &quot;You have to try.
Don&#39;t scold it until you know what you&#39;re talking about.
Say some of these words out loud and you&#39;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello&#39;s last monologue for the documentary and was hooked.
I got the feeling that I can do it.
As if my head was straightened.
&quot;That&#39;s what it is, it&#39;s serious business, take it seriously, learn your lyrics, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough and I had been reading this piece for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it did not happen.
Soon we started The Comedy of Errors.
All of a sudden I&#39;m at the National Theater and I just couldn&#39;t quite believe it.
There was one moment when I thought, &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve changed.&quot;
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
&quot;A small voice inside me said, &#39;You&#39;ll have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer.&#39;&quot;
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the issue was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, &quot;Oh, thank God.&quot;
It&#39;s not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with it.
&quot;You&#39;re in a play, stay in the role.&quot;
Henry in &quot;Fences&quot; at the Duchess Theater
Learning the lyrics for &quot;Fences&quot; was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also received well, so it was like a sign from above, showing: &quot;This is what you need to do.&quot;
He says it, of course, in a THAMMER voice.
So I&#39;m holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the mindset of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts and finishes parodying.
I just decided not to work in stand-up because this whole room full of strangers instant gratification thing is pretty dangerous I think.
If you strive for this all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don&#39;t have as much fun as I used to.
I ask if he will do a stand-up tour again someday.
The joy of sitting indoors with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the journey - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It&#39;s good fun.
You&#39;re always telling a story, and here&#39;s a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify &#39;invisible workers&#39;
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove &quot;invisible workers&quot; from the government&#39;s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to reduce government corruption after he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was being wasted in payments to &quot;invisible workers&quot; and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves government service, reports BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All government employees must report to ID centers within the next two weeks to ensure their data is collected through a biometric registration process, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without good reason will be struck off the payroll, it says.
&quot;This procedure will go a long way towards streamlining the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government - hence putting an end to the invisible worker problem,&quot; said Anne Vayguru, cabinet secretary for planning. and structuring of power.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested in connection with &#39;conspiracy&#39; against government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of &quot;conspiracy against the government,&quot; according to local news agencies.
Police officials did not immediately comment on this information.
Among those detained were 14 high-ranking officers, Hurriyet Daily News reported.
Some of them participated last December in a corruption screening exercise that targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized crime group and wiretapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) identified their actions as part of a crackdown on him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer break.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On the first of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk&#39;s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that the children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their later life.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated with children putting on embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rhona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable leader it needs
Behind her is a trail of fame from the worlds of banking, media management and the inner circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co and then moved on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a lower-ranking male colleague took a senior position at parent company Pearson&#39;s.
She is said to be earning close to £1 million.
Her political rating is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he was trying to bring professionals from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman&#39;s job a poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an inherent paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inward as the top level of the BBC&#39;s own management hierarchy, but also outward as a voice of public concern and unrest when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs a complete radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in, trampling and destroying an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, if he put himself out of a job in the process.
This is a difficult decision.
If it weren&#39;t so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over license costs pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British are buying a stake in what is by far the world&#39;s greatest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims its results reach 96 percent of households and cost each of them as little as 40p a day.
What&#39;s more, it&#39;s clear that Beeb&#39;s popularity is on the rise: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
Watching and using the BBC has changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the programs I missed on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and imposing institution.
It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one.
Perry from Texas says humiliating tweet was written by someone else
A tweet from the verified account of Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for alleged abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry&#39;s account, which disavowed the post.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
&quot;I don&#39;t approve of this tweet and I took it down,&quot; a later entry says.
Perry&#39;s aides did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
While the entries were uploaded from Perry&#39;s verified account, it was not clear who was actually posting to the feed.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon of County Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving under the influence in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her agency when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.
The caption of the tweet reads: &quot;I don&#39;t always drive 3 times the legal blood alcohol level... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me this.&quot;
I&#39;m the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the allegations a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is vague and unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funding for the Travis County-based Public Compliance Division that prosecutes corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted an official complaint from a left-wing public watchdog group.
Perry&#39;s verified account feed is frequently updated - and occasionally famous.
Coming in fifth at the Iowa convention during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running next to a lake and the words: &quot;Here we are, South Caroline!&quot;
Berkeley says real estate market is back to &#39;normal&#39;
One of London&#39;s most prominent property developers has warned that the property market in southeast England has &quot;returned&quot; to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and skyrocketing prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of luxury construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday: &quot;Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its 2013 peak,&quot; adding that it provided &quot;a stable working environment.&quot;
The London property market did well during the downturn as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, well ahead of the 6.7 percent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes have risen by about one-fifth in the past year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stymied by new property taxes and political rhetoric surrounding a potential &quot;mansion tax&quot; ahead of next May&#39;s general election.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April&#39;s mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher lending conditions, would also dampen market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed mortgage approvals falling in June, suggesting a further chill in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its 2015 London property price growth forecast to 3 per cent on the basis that property price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes meanwhile fell by a quarter from the previous year in London&#39;s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital has proven to be very beneficial for Berkeley, pushing sales in excess of £2.2bn.
Mr Pidgley added: &quot;Demand for the right product with good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, long-term sales have held up.&quot;
The company said in June that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April, almost a third more than it had during its 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40% year-over-year to £380m, with revenue up 18% to £1.6bn.
Speaking before the company&#39;s annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pidgley said Berkeley&#39;s estimated earnings for this year will be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts are unanimous in forecasting full-year pre-tax earnings of £450m.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been posted online by a hacker who claims to have a &quot;catalogue&quot; of photos of 100 more rising stars.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence&#39;s photos were real and condemned the hacker for &quot;brazenly invading privacy.&quot;
Law enforcement has been contacted and they will prosecute anyone who releases stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a flaw in Apple&#39;s iCloud online storage system, and the purported &quot;catalogue&quot; of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It&#39;s unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim vs. The World star Winstead also denounced the hack on Twitter.
&quot;For those of you looking at the photos my husband and I took a few years ago at home, I hope you&#39;re proud of yourself,&quot; Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon series &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; denied that she was in the photos, tweeting: &quot;These so-called nude photos of me are FAKE, folks.
Let me nip this in the bud. *intentional pun*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos believed to be of her are genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson&#39;s critically acclaimed new novel about love and the letter &quot;J&quot;
They dissolved, that&#39;s the best way to say it, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, difficult to communicate with, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was prickly as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this pricklyness was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, getting rid of a lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some kind of satisfaction.
Eilynn Solomons was a quiveringly fragile beauty with tousled hair and a fluttering heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion whom Cavern believed to be her aunt, the latter inheriting a house in a damp but paradise-like valley, cheerfully called Paradise Valley.
No one has lived in the house for several years.
The pipes leaked, spiders sat motionless in the baths, slugs left their marks on all the windows, sure that the house was theirs; the garden is overgrown with weeds that look like giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage in a children&#39;s book, both frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.
Author&#39;s perspective: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot;J&quot; was longlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
Shortlist will be announced next week
Kavern and Eilynn sat hand in hand in broken deck chairs among the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly plugged into a cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, glancing at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black artist that his father liked to listen to while pulling down the curtains in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren&#39;t banned - nothing really was banned - they just weren&#39;t played anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word &quot;archaic&quot; itself.
Public taste did what orders and prescriptions could never achieve, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing of Eileenn&#39;s big feet in a gruff comic voice.
Eileen didn&#39;t understand.
&quot;It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,&quot; he told her, putting two fingers to his lips automatically.
That&#39;s what his father always did to stop the &quot;J&quot; from leaving his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with &quot;J&quot; and forget to put two fingers to your mouth and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn&#39;t a very fun game then, and it&#39;s not a very fun game now.
He knew what was expected of him, that&#39;s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with wit.
His unpredictability got on people&#39;s nerves.
And jazz was wit expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Cavern knew about jazz from his father&#39;s semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn&#39;t have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were temperamentally and physically well-suited for entertainment and sports—and they sang and ran.
Natives of Hindustan, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, undertook to ensure that not a single family was left without a working electronic telephone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was engaged in plumbing work; what was left of the Greek beat the cymbals.
GCC and Levantine people whose grandparents did not leave the country in a hurry when WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED AT ALL, in fear of being accused of starting the flames, in fear, in fact, that the flames would consume them next, opened restaurants with labne and hookahs, did not stick out and yearned for idleness.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult for Eileenn to understand how the insulting words that Kavern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music is an expression of love.
&quot;They&#39;re not really offensive,&quot; Kevern said.
Unless, maybe, for people who have big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He had said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Not a single word could penetrate the soundproofing of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen still didn&#39;t understand.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say that this was a joke, but he did not want to press two fingers to his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
&quot;He thought it was funny,&quot; he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern&#39;s view.
There was nothing in the whole world but a mop of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he wants to look at.
&quot;Well, if you say so,&quot; she said, holding her own.
But that still doesn&#39;t explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at them again.
Can&#39;t say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don&#39;t hate you.
It&#39;s just this stupid song.
He could say, &quot;I love you,&quot; but it was too early for that.
&quot;I like you precisely because you have thick ankles,&quot; he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
It didn&#39;t sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that calming charm that could soften the cruelty hidden in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eileenn Solomons blushed and rose from her sun lounger, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Elderberry wine, so drunkenness was no excuse.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
&quot;And I like you precisely because you have a stupid head,&quot; she said...
Even though you don&#39;t like it.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn&#39;t talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she&#39;d grown up, but he had no doubt that she was similar in basic features to her here.
The same huge icy ocean crashed down on them both.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED AT ALL, than their forefathers, the smugglers and destroyers, roamed furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand against any woman who dared to refuse or tease them. their.
Dumb head?
They would have shown her a blunt fist if she hadn&#39;t been careful!
First they would kiss - the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the insipid ballads the console was throwing out was to kiss her first, then slap her.
An over-elaboration, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed with her body that he needed to leave.
He got up from the deck chair like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn&#39;t the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the upper window she watched him go, her companion - a man who took on the hardships himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a pang of compassion for him and men in general, even though some of them raised their hands to her.
The man who turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, smitten, all ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen such ?
Alone again, Eilynn Solomons looked down at her feet.
Twenty or so years before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Offnau, an unofficial Public Mood Control service, produced a short report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in those very parts of the country. , where it was expected that it would be reduced, if not completely stopped, given the funds and forces that were allocated for its eradication.
&quot;Much has been done, and much is being done,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow clefts of the country, where, despite the hovering spiers of churches , the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in all of history.
However, some qualities, it turns out, are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it generates.
The populace sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcoming obstacles, and proclaims their fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, yet not only does the old rudeness retain its strong grip in both rural and urban communities, but there are also reports of that a new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, on the roads, and even on playgrounds.
&quot;You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much,&quot; her supervisor said after reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have to answer,&quot; Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
&quot;I&#39;m asking,&quot; Luther Rabinowitz finally said, &quot;not because I&#39;m against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call &quot;spiteful&quot; and &quot;rude&quot; others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to whine about WHAT HAPPENED, if it happened at all, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-pink LED letters echoed the advice Offnau had given the country for the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
&quot;I fully understand what you mean,&quot; Esme Nussbaum replied softly as she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to say anything other than that we haven&#39;t healed as effectively as we make ourselves believe.
My concern is that if we are not prepared, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED AT ALL, in the first place.
Only this time we will take out our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
&quot;You are going too far,&quot; he said, &quot;by calling &#39;mistakes&#39; the actions that our grandfathers did or didn&#39;t do.
You are going too far when you say that they took their &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;distrust&quot; out on &quot;others&quot;.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that in understanding the past, that is, in defending the present, we do not talk about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;
There was no &quot;us&quot; and there was no &quot;other&quot;.
It was a time of confusion - that&#39;s all we know.
&quot;For which, to be honest with ourselves,&quot; Esme ventured to put in, &quot;no part of society can justify itself well.
I don&#39;t blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what&#39;s done is done.
Then it was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - here we agree.
And just as there is no need to blame anyone, there is no need to make excuses if it were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I can add one word to this -
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovitz collapsed.
&quot;I will review your report,&quot; he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in what passers-by described as &quot;in a vicious rage.&quot;
Matches happen.
The Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho army officials denied plotting a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane left the country, saying that the country&#39;s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming he had received a threat of an attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from &quot;political fanatics&quot; whom the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police force who are really planning to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were ready to wreak havoc &quot;, he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clason Moniela said the army&#39;s actions looked like a coup.
&quot;While no one has made claims of taking power by force, by all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,&quot; he said.
Lesotho army officials said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital is calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in Thabane&#39;s absence.
Thabane said he believes he is under attack for trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at AC Milan, according to the Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours to undergo a medical examination.
Last season, he entered the field as part of the London club only three times.
We will remind that earlier “Milan” rented from “Liverpool” striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone manufacturing at lowest in 13 months
Eurozone output growth slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the index of business activity (PMI) for the manufacturing sector of the eurozone Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will look to the bank for a clear plan on how to deal with stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation as low as 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give further signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
&quot;While some growth is better than no growth at all, the drag on manufacturers from rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty is becoming more apparent,&quot; said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia&#39;s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc&#39;s second largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy&#39;s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has faded in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,&quot; Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire of analysts who are waiting for the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One piece of positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The best thing to say about the August Eurozone Manufacturing PMI survey is that it shows the sector is still growing.&quot;
He added: &quot;Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially those related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it &quot;looks more and more&quot; that the ECB will eventually need to implement some form of quantitative easing, &quot;although we suspect it will be limited.&quot;
Residents of Mariupol put up a human chain against the militias
Everything was calm in Mariupol until last week - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People&#39;s Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the &quot;militias&quot;.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol in order to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which before that was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
Mariupol residents decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, had few forces against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a human chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They&#39;re going to do the same in the event of an offensive.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, and publish a newspaper.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten years of hell for survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of the school, how the children who ended up in it still suffer
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united east and west in disgust, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future in the midst of the greatest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during a school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who stood up to adversity, though the memories of terrorist hell will live on forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now stop.
The girl in the photo is trying to climb back into the shelled sports hall
She was captured in a picture by famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in only her underwear she tried to climb back into the shelled sports hall after a mine explosion.
At a loss, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
&quot;The woman told me to run with all my might, but I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Aida said then.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and crawled back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and carried her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I&#39;m afraid I may need more surgery.
A few splinters are left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
&quot;This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn&#39;t break it,&quot; she says defiantly.
&quot;It happened to me and you can&#39;t change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed that we would go to school together.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I&#39;ll think about my family later.
She says the grip stays with her, though the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I climb into a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that this does not happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets believing his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture while hugging his mother, Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said: &quot;Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand.&quot;
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, &quot;Run.&quot;
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way he saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t save her.&quot;
In fact, Tamara got free and was in the hospital with wounds on her legs, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said, &quot;I cried with joy.
I couldn&#39;t believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the now defunct News of the World) where he was honored as Barnardo&#39;s Children&#39;s Advocate by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
&quot;This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,&quot; he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that my memory is fading.
I remember right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer shooting games and it&#39;s not a problem for me.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don&#39;t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say that they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and the open top car ride.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of grief that he and his friends endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
&quot;I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,&quot; said Damir, who volunteered at the convent last week.
I so want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope to be enrolled in a training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: &quot;37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And only a month has passed since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: &quot;I keep thinking this world hasn&#39;t gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people war is a news report they listen to when they&#39;re bored or when they&#39;re doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can&#39;t stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it&#39;s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not angry.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn&#39;t like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember him lying on the couch, turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember that I shouted to him: “Damir, run, run away,” but then again I was so sure that he did not hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The Boy Whose Shocking Post-Capture Photo Became Determinant of the Beslan Tragedy
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right Georgy today
His bloody face was marked with fear as he fled from death as Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the head physician, took him to school on his first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
&quot;I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,&quot; she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don&#39;t think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days are always before my eyes.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
It sinks into the soul: the photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in sculpture (right)
I remember that George was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of weeping George in San Marino.
George doesn&#39;t like to look at this photo and it is hidden in a bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It is important that this never happens again.
&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is heading towards something very bad.
&quot;I can&#39;t understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to pass in order to forget her a little.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had nightmares about the seizure, but now it&#39;s better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That&#39;s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It&#39;s hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don&#39;t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won&#39;t forget it, but I don&#39;t feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be in the military, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won&#39;t happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The Boy Who Survived Despite Being at the Feet of a Killer Terrorist
Incredible: Georgy Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the assassin.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
&quot;We feel like it was yesterday,&quot; says Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer with the FSB but couldn&#39;t because of the damage he suffered during the capture.
It&#39;s still with me, it&#39;s not something I left behind.
I&#39;m older now and they say that kids deal with bad events easily - I have to say that&#39;s not true.
&quot;In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can&#39;t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I fainted.
I would never go there again and please don&#39;t ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with a photo of himself open on his laptop in the hospital after being captured
My pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don&#39;t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
In terms of physical condition, I am healthy.
I have to be careful with my knee, which was damaged, but now I am walking normally.
But still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals &quot;from cats to cows&quot;.
He said, &quot;I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: &quot;This pain never leaves me.
She&#39;s in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know that George will not go.
For him, she must be even stronger, because he was there and I was not.
I was waiting for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he returned to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint lies on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It&#39;s hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but he cannot do it because of his knee.
He&#39;s had multiple surgeries and can walk but can&#39;t play sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the takeover and this only adds to my pain.
I have lost many people whom I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and this is the best gift that God could give me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never remarried.
It&#39;s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don&#39;t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only it were possible to grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby touchingly taken to safety by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Alena Tskayeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
Now she is ten (on the right), and she has no memory of the monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was carried in her arms from a seized school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alyona&#39;s mother and sister died in a mortal massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter whom he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, now ten, remembers nothing of the capture and has blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
&quot;They are a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both wonderful kids,&quot; says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he is looking forward to being able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will play for Borussia again, ”Kagawa quotes Bild as saying.
I feel very good.
I am full of positive emotions and look forward to when I can again enter the field in the form of Borussia.
Recall that Kagawa moved to Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English Championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man charged with running over girl at pelican crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will stand trial on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at a pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a crossing at Pittenveen in East Newk.
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, pleaded not guilty in Dundee Sheriff&#39;s Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair QC has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not shop in Vladivostok
The Duty Free shop at Vladivostok Airport posted a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from shopping at this shop.
Do not stock them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Timoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other well-known comrades will not be able to stock up on vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And posted a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on appearing in an institution even less accessible to him by the nature of his service - Diet canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president ever cherished the dream of eating in a dietary canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to launch the production of cheese varieties that are in demand among buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Yugpticeprom enterprise of the Agrocomplex company.
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to switch to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
A year-long embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia from 7 August.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes &quot;All Sport&quot; Maslakov&#39;s words.
The third place is a confirmation of our rather high team level.
It&#39;s nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It must be taken into account that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not forced our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become second in this tournament, but this season our team has been updated.
The French, on the contrary, put up a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They made no secret of their intention to win this year, which they publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed at a good level in such a representative company.
But the results in some events were an order of magnitude lower than in the same &quot;Diamond League&quot;.
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is not so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it reached the point of absurdity, when at 1500 meters the men were so fond of the tactical intricacies of running that they showed a result below the average level ... of women&#39;s races.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or shoot videos underwater, there are a number of options available to you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for around $300.
I took these pictures at a family reunion with several cameras, all priced around $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow in order to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you&#39;ll be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have shooting or subject type modes that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer&#39;s guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose shots, while action cameras usually don&#39;t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see it underwater and framing will be a random process.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a burst mode that takes multiple shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to your subjects.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it&#39;s even more important underwater due to the darker lighting conditions.
Especially important if you&#39;re shooting with an action camera: These gear often have a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you&#39;ll have to get closer to your subjects if you want to fill the frame.
Freestyle wrestling bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games Bilyal Makhov may move to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the Dagestan freestyle wrestling team Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the athlete&#39;s participation in the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilyal Makhov is at the training camp of the &quot;classics&quot; team, - R-Sport quotes the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, in juniors, Bilal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize-winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that our heavyweight will spend a new stage of his career in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can already perform at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the estimate.
But the final word is always with the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose strength of personality could shake things up, even in an organization as gigantic as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to relieving patients of both the pain of disease and the anguish of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, those under treatment are mainly concerned with something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
&quot;I didn&#39;t feel like I used to,&quot; he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself irritably chiding his wife, Juliet.
&quot;I want things to happen faster, not later,&quot; he noted.
When Juliet was away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to take a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The x-ray results are back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers develop lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material once called a &quot;miracle&quot; but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a voluntary industrial ban came into effect.
Even when it was in use, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe fitters, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it&#39;s hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of approximately 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial engineering.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, wealth, profession or age.
Bastions of selectivity, from trendy London department stores to private schools, have proven to be no salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are meant to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe fitter.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
&quot;It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy&#39;s Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship,&quot; he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could only give a partial answer.
&quot;Of four doctors who have interned at Guy&#39;s Hospital and subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years,&quot; he noted in a letter in 2010, &quot;I am the only one left alive.&quot;
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Living this long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of being diagnosed.
She is always deadly.
Thus, now we can only repeat Lawson&#39;s question: &quot;How many of us will get this same disease?&quot;
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pitot, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK should have died out, about 90,000 people will die.
Most now do not imagine that they will die this way.

A quick scan of reports from courtrooms, where victims often go to seek compensation, reveals just how far the mesothelioma scourge has spread.
This June, for example, Marks &amp; Spencer admitted to having overseen Janice Ellen exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working for M&amp;S.
Now she has two children over 20 years old.
“Before this happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that this would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Strictly speaking, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word &quot;asbestiform&quot;, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler joints, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a &quot;serious source of harm to health&quot; that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the world&#39;s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that &quot;there are strong, albeit indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK].&quot;

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pitot&#39;s work suggests her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that &quot;a significant percentage of mesotheliomas, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.&quot;
Much of that impact, he says, is due to &quot;typical usage and weather exposure&quot; to our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he&#39;s safe.
A Goddard Consulting report that looked at the Palace of Westminster demonstrates how people, even at the very heart of government, could be affected unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shafts and pipelines behind parliamentary committee offices were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be set in motion by something as harmless as &quot;strong air currents&quot;.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster received a &quot;clean health certificate&quot;, it has now acknowledged that £1bn worth of work needs to be done to refurbish the Parliament, with electrical upgrades and asbestos removal, and that after the 2015 general election Members of Parliament may sit at the QE2 Convention Center nearby rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that &quot;the asbestos situation has not been managed according to various rules.&quot;
There is no way to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
&quot;I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos,&quot; he says, &quot;but I can&#39;t prove it in my case.
It&#39;s so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck down by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45 and was in the middle of an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I started to have a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took chest X-rays and inserted pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he exercised and panted.
In 2011, one of Abbott&#39;s patients came to his waiting room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott&#39;s condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT scans and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped transducer was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I&#39;m an optimist.
I usually just move on,&quot; he says.
I didn&#39;t worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: &quot;They told me it was mesothelioma.&quot;
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott was immersed in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
&quot;It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos insulation on pipes,&quot; he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients were unlikely to be harmed.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement canteens (like Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly did get exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were places where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It still continues to be removed today.
Schoolchildren mounted their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it&#39;s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its amazing insulating and fire retardant properties.
Schools too.
As a matter of fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren set up their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have sprung up that draw attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things like floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
&quot;It&#39;s an industrial poison in a lot of our buildings,&quot; said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in Guy&#39;s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact the sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when demolishing garden sheds.
The effect of a diagnosis when a disease is known to be incurable is enormous.
&quot;It takes quite a long time to realize this,&quot; says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue but realized that I couldn&#39;t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won&#39;t see Christmas again
One of the most difficult things was the transition from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being bewildered by the amount of information he had to take in.
&quot;It was hard to grasp everything,&quot; he says.
&quot;I asked my doctor, &#39;What time do I have?&#39;
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to see Christmas again.
That&#39;s all&quot;&quot;.
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we keep alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
&quot;The problem comes from breathing in the needle fibers of asbestos,&quot; Prof. Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy&#39;s Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he had been exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading mesothelioma center.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while probing at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed out by the breath to the periphery where the sheath is.
It is, at its core, an invasive process from the start.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it&#39;s worth a try.
Treasurer disagrees.
&quot;You can&#39;t cut out the pleura,&quot; he says.
It is impossible to approach her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer &quot;does not respond well to chemotherapy&quot; which &quot;works&quot; but does not cure.
&quot;From time to time there are patients who live long,&quot; Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after being diagnosed, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he contracted mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became the single-handed support and advice bureau for mesothelioma patients.
&quot;Hello, Cancer Central,&quot; he said cheerfully when they called.
&quot;He was very positive,&quot; says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and is still very energetic.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
&quot;I was desperate,&quot; he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, &quot;managed to make things a little more positive.&quot;
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lange-Lazdunsky, Professor of Thoracic Surgery at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
&quot;We had the advantage that I didn&#39;t need a referral, I just called them and they took me in,&quot; admits Graham.
The average patient would have to get a referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a critical role for mesothelioma patients to receive the best available treatments.
However, when such treatments finally fail, many sufferers face yet another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they turn to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
&quot;Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,&quot; says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that they started talking about the dishonesty of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy&#39;s Hospital eventually settled, but it was not a &quot;full cost settlement&quot; according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to definitively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, Guy&#39;s hospital spokesman confirmed, however, that &quot;the asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s.&quot;
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
As a matter of fact, tying a fatal asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients demanding compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed.
Insurance archives could be lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that time is on their side, which plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, major new legislation came out this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to claim compensation, even if their former employers can&#39;t be traced back.
Under the law, a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of what a court would award in a normal compensation case - around £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350m represents &quot;very good work&quot; for the insurance industry.
&quot;It&#39;s a deal written by insurers for insurers,&quot; he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time lag hadn&#39;t intervened and mesothelioma patients could track down the companies and file a claim in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Secretary of Works and Pensions, admitted that the law was &quot;imperfect&quot;.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
&quot;People are suffering so much and they need help today,&quot; Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he finds effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasts a whopping 40 percent of surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt energized.
&quot;It&#39;s certainly one of the most important things,&quot; says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is some power that is holding you up.
When you give up, the condition can worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were several spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It&#39;s not a life threat.
This is the end of life.
Once again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how the timer on the boiler works.
When you receive bad news, you become bleak.
We need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it&#39;s not always easy.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult for a parent,&quot; he says.
It&#39;s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I would not live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very outgoing and energetic.
She told all her friends and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn&#39;t say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of possibility to survive.
This disease brings with it (even as it eventually did for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a life threat.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China&#39;s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run candidates in the 2017 election despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People&#39;s Congress, in effect, allows the communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
&quot;It didn&#39;t disappoint us, but it&#39;s still infuriating,&quot; said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China&#39;s decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee, said it would be too &quot;chaotic&quot; to allow a popular nomination of Hong Kong&#39;s leader.
Since 1997, when the UK handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote on their head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday&#39;s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to keep a firm grip on the process with a nominating commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who &quot;love the country and love Hong Kong&quot; will be admitted.
The decision came after a summer that saw some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong&#39;s financial district unless Beijing guarantees true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement &quot;contemplated taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we report that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for several days, and on Sunday, security was stepped up at government headquarters with the involvement of police and barricades.
At the heart of the riots is the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong&#39;s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put Hong Kong&#39;s lifeblood business at risk.
&quot;The protest they&#39;re talking about, it could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,&quot; said legislator Regina Yip, who has long been a critic of the movement.
We don&#39;t want to spread anxiety that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a view that is detrimental to investment.
Chinese state media have also been reporting in recent days that portrayed Hong Kong pro-democracy activists as saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on suffrage that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong&#39;s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took to the streets in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region&#39;s history.
American prom culture extends to university life: Freshmen encouraged to arrive by private jet
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK&#39;s first luxury travel service for current students.
To make your arrival at the university a vivid experience, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year&#39;s students get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the service has just launched, no orders have yet been received, but added that &quot;students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.&quot;
The company also said that while students have to pay £9,000 a year in tuition, they still hope to find a market for the service.
Today&#39;s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it&#39;s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: &quot;This project appears to be incredibly out of touch with the lives of most students.
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis in which affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants has not kept pace with soaring spending on basic necessities before they can even begin to think about take out thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival at a hostel.
Feminists Raise Race and Police Behavior After Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those attending raise their hands, chanting &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot&quot; as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in white feminist conversation online.
In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender over race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and gained national attention, Perez saw responses from white women that focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women shortly after the Aug. 9 assassination, personal essays with titles such as &quot;Thinking about Ferguson from a white woman&#39;s point of view&quot; and &quot;Feminism is not just about the oppression of women&quot; came relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
&quot;In feminism, I don&#39;t think there are many people who talk about whiteness and privilege at such a high level,&quot; she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
It&#39;s very emblematic of the crisis we&#39;re facing, and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially tied, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Ohio State University professor of English Corita Mitchell, Ferguson laid bare the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as &quot;women&#39;s problems&quot; in the cultural realm.
&quot;I can post something funny on Facebook about what&#39;s going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,&quot; says Mitchell.
When I write something about how people of color are being attacked in my own country, the silence is deafening.
&quot;Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships in public but not safety in the public sphere?&quot; she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these issues; they face complex realities every day.
While white women are now integrating issues of race and gender into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women&#39;s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
&quot;Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,&quot; Hattery said.
It needed a white woman to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery&#39;s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony looked into the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for suffrage would only be effective for one of the groups: women or blacks. .
&quot;They made the decision to put all their eggs in the women&#39;s voting rights basket, and black voting rights would come later,&quot; Hattery said.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don&#39;t trust white women.
We didn&#39;t do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to organize against lynchings into the Southern Women&#39;s Association to Prevent Lynchings.
The group comes almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell&#39;s point of view, the rise in white feminist reactions to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to &quot;catch up&quot; with issues that black women had dealt with for generations.
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to contraception?&quot; Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
Prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown&#39;s assassination, took to Facebook to post a scathing op-ed by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll demanding that white Americans become more involved in protests over racism.
&quot;I hope women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will lead the change,&quot; Steinem wrote.
While Steinem vouches for a more cross-cutting feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are &quot;much more vulnerable than their sisters,&quot; but Steinem&#39;s remarks about Ferguson contradict criticism. which she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother&#39;s Watchman, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, there was an outcry from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only issues pushing the front lines of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Patrol arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country&#39;s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has resurfaced - this time as a women&#39;s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said all she had to do to make the issue as important to women was to share the stories of immigrant women.
&quot;They speak for themselves,&quot; Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], the women who come with them are in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
&quot;These stories resonate with women&#39;s organizations,&quot; she said.
Ipswich house &quot;with a pig&quot; for sale
A photo of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by estate agents when it appeared to show a large pig lounging in the living room.
Listed for sale for £120,000, this one-bedroom detached house sits on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description differed by a photograph of the living room of the house - which showed a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner&#39;s pet.
&quot;However, the photo was posted in error and has since been removed,&quot; a spokesperson for the company said.
In a detailed description of the home, Connells described the former meeting house as &quot;a unique one-bedroom detached home.&quot;
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily Osipov reports from New York.
In general, how would you rate your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I&#39;m glad that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the endings of some matches.
Now, of course, I&#39;m upset.
After all, she could not even reach the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After a disappointing defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on and I&#39;m going to do my best to end the year with dignity.
The Asian Tournament Series starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses for entering universities for fulfilling the TRP standards.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pulling up, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 constituent entities of Russia will begin to implement TRP norms on their territory from September 1.
I also offered schoolchildren who passed the TRP to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, they can add a little points to the exam.
There are also proposals to give an additional day off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
The town of Harvey in South Wales has a new millionaire after winning the lottery
Lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky person will take home almost $1.1 million from Saturday night&#39;s lottery draw.
The newsstand in Harvey brings gold in the grand prize draw for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a prize could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the grand prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state&#39;s players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of August&#39;s five millionaires, following a huge $7.5 million win from the Belmont couple just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and said the win has given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey Millionaire brings Western Australia&#39;s top prize winners to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Oleg Pluzhnikov, deputy director of the department of the ministry, at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles running on natural gas fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (Vedomosti has a copy) is designed for 2014-2017.
Evaluation criteria for electric and hybrid vehicles are to be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be ready by December 2014; the preferential lending and preferential leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015 it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend during 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such vehicles.
Finally, by October 2014 the Ministry of Economic Development will add to the list of indicators for evaluating the activities of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly vehicles, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is just being formed - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was reset to zero, so sales will amount to about 500 units, Andrey Pankov, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, predicts.
But even a five-fold increase does not make electric vehicles any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Nicolas Remis, director of strategic planning and partnerships for Renault in Russia.
The majority of other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Russian manufacturers also have developments of electric vehicles - &quot;&quot;, GAZ, &quot;&quot;, but the output is scanty.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ACM Holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, AvtoVAZ director for engineering Sergei Amanov admits, there will be no breakthrough in this segment without state support....
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average, are twice as expensive as their counterparts with internal combustion engines), is constrained by the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (gas stations - a few), sighs Avtostat CEO Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rates of cost reduction, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, Mikhail Podorozhansky, editor-in-chief of Autoreview, predicts, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say some EV models are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that &quot;electromobility&quot; is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of more and more charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of filling stations are also underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofyin, director of the Rosseti department, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build filling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a grid company, does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the possibility of doing this in relation to charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of an electric car market in Russia is the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being considered.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangibly as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The vehicle tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike in Norway, for example, where tax cuts have boosted sales of electric vehicles, which now account for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along dedicated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
Private jet crashes in Colorado
A Piper PA-46 single-engine plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it died, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport in Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, captured militants of the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion are dealt with.
The punishers were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security officials died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the real situation is in southeastern Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion remained alive after the &quot;meat grinder&quot; in which they fell near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When they were informed from the headquarters that it was possible to leave the &quot;ring&quot; along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all sides.
“Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave,” says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign Lermontov.
And when we descended into the lowland between Mnohopillye and Chervonoselsky, a crossfire began from anti-tank guided missiles, from Zushki, 30-mm grenade launchers, BMD automatic cannons, and small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three behind me, as a result of which there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign &quot;Lermontov&quot; says: at least 60 people died almost immediately, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now receiving medical care from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called &quot;terrorists&quot; treat them well, give them food and medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
A column, an entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion, like many of his comrades, Aleksei volunteered, because the Ukrainian news talked about the atrocities allegedly committed in the southeast by &quot;separatists&quot;.
Already here, Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - and not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that mortar shelling was going on, that most likely it was the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Oleksiy.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
They did not let us out of Ilovaisk, they said that we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, I have already written a report about leaving.
From the training camp from Zurakhovo we were immediately taken to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people got stuck in the &quot;cauldron&quot; near Ilovaisk.
Now some of the survivors admit that if they could turn back time, they would never join the punitive battalion.
The militias handed over all the prisoners to the security forces of the DPR.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
Headquarters set up in the region to limit food prices
A headquarters has been set up in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, which, if necessary, will limit the rise in prices for products in the region&#39;s market.
The decree on the creation of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters included members of the government of the region, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory departments.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Vesti Ekonomika ― Will Kyiv reimburse Rosneft for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk oil refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
&quot;We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation,&quot; Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansk refinery was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
&quot;There were no battles, there were no&quot; dug-in rebels &quot;, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil pumped into the pipes disappeared,&quot; he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisichansk Oil Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel, as well as batches of Euro-5 standard diesel fuel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its unprofitability.
The company decided to start renovations.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
North Korea launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 am local time from the province of Chagando, which is located on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose at the opening of 3 kopecks. to 37.15 rubles, the ruble fell against the dual-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
Trades on the UTS on the dollar started with transactions within the limits of 37.11-37.2 rubles/$1, on average for two minutes the exchange rate was fixed at the level of 37.16 rubles/$1, which is 4 kopecks. above the previous close.
The euro exchange rate amounted to 48.79 rubles. for 1 euro, this is 3 kopecks. above the previous close.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42.395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading at 23 kopecks. above the official rate, the euro - by 16 kopecks. above the official rate.
On Friday, August 29, the Russian market continued its rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
The ruble also continued to fall in price and even renewed its historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing out the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia in advance.
However, so far it looks more like an artificial hysteria, inflated through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not so many options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade &quot;At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the dual-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both Russian indices and the positions of the national currency may correct.
&quot;Orenburg Airlines&quot; will sue &quot;Ideal Tour&quot;
Orenburg Airlines filed claims against Ideal Tour for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, the hearings on which will be held in October.
Cases will be heard by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on 14 August.
Its amount is slightly more than 425 million rubles.
A meeting on it is scheduled for October 7th.
The second application was submitted on 18 August.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
A meeting on it is scheduled for October 2.
As journalists were told in the Russian Union of the Tourist Industry, different judges were appointed for the cases.
In July, information appeared in the media about the debts of Ideal Tour to Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The general director of the airline, Viktor Zyukin, talks about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
The general director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, names an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Microblogging service Twitter has changed the user registration process in order to quickly involve new members in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandoned their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will browse a large number of recommended accounts during registration to immediately create their own reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated during registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically checks the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually uncheck the boxes so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service only saw avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger&#39;s popular tweets to help give an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter signup page in three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on modernizing the service.
Such activity is connected, first of all, with the ongoing attempts of the service to break even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company is currently in desperate need of more loyal customers who, once logged in, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the suburbs - 13-18 degrees.
If the weather is cloudy with clearings, it will rain in some places, the wind of the eastern quarter will be rather weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The car recycling program resumed from September 1
From September 1, Russia resumes the program for the recycling of cars.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all vehicles older than six years.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 rubles for a passenger car to 350,000 rubles for a truck.
Previously, a similar car recycling program has already been operating in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is planned not only to dispose of cars to receive a subsequent discount, but also the opportunity, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one at a discount when handing over the old one in a &quot;trade-in&quot; at the dealer, Interfax reports.
Over 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (an increase of 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it&#39;s only now that it&#39;s become widely known.
The inspiration for the game came from the events in Ferguson, where there are now protests that began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The project, which has yet to be named, will focus on how the media coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he filmed the scene so that the cops look like heroes and the protesters look like thugs, the police will treat him better and let him go where the average person cannot go.
If he reports differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored using the hero&#39;s twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there turn out to be popular.
The game does not yet have a name.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image demonstrating how an event can change depending on how a photo of it is taken and edited.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to the protests in the United States, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from the biography of Case himself, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to open up about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletey draws Ukraine into the continuation of the bloodshed
With a call to prepare for the next &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey is drawing the people into the continuation of a bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
&quot;In Moscow, of course, they paid attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Heletey, who announced the &quot;completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists&quot; and the beginning of the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot;, the losses in which will be in the &quot;tens of thousands&quot;.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field,&quot; the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian defense minister wrote on Monday: &quot;Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.&quot;
At the same time, he said that &quot;the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine&quot; was completed.
Perez Hilton has deleted all the intimate pictures of the stars and apologized
Today, the horror has gripped more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers cracked primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
True, not for long.
Recall that the official representative of the star of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all the pictures that &quot;shine&quot; on the Web are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid website of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their candid shots, writes The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do this.
I have not been contacted by their agents.
And now I will delete candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice,&quot; the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already scattered across the Web.

It happened in Los Angeles at the corner on Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer escaped with a bruise and a muscle strain in his right hand.
Beckham left the tattoo parlor where the paparazzi were waiting for him.

Tony Stewart crashes back on track
Tony Stewart&#39;s return to the track ended a little more than halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172, ending his run.
Stewart drove his beat-up car to the garage and then got out without speaking to reporters.
His team principal Chad Johnston said the 14 team members were upset but would now focus on next weekend&#39;s race in Richmond, Virginia.
&quot;I wish there was a better run and a better finish for him,&quot; said Johnston.
We&#39;ll go to Richmond and hopefully we&#39;ll do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the Sunday night race after colliding with Kyle Busch, requiring repairs to the right side of his car.
&quot;I started today with a pretty high hope of finishing well,&quot; Johnston said, adding, &quot;It just didn&#39;t work out.&quot;
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart&#39;s car was loaded onto a tow truck and the crew packed up and got ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and needed to win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work while investigating the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to complain to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
A decision on whether Stewart will be charged has not been made.
The three-time champion was met with cheers and applause as he was introduced before the race.
Starting in 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, finishing in fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart, Busch&#39;s number.
car 18 went off track at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued but fell back to 21st position.

The picture shows that Maxim is cooking something with diligence, and pickles and baked chicken are already served on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the return of the old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Salary increases are also on the list of demands to be discussed with Acting Minister of Justice Khristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the old 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison employees met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement was reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The negotiations are ongoing, the head of the Main Department for the Execution of Sentences, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BPR.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will join the protest of the prison employees&#39; union.
Army controls new Thai government
General Prayut (right) appoints Prawit Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defense
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the country&#39;s new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are occupied by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-o-cha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to this post.
The 60-year-old military man who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for the premiership.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed MPs.
According to Prayut Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra&#39;s government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-o-cha will be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were put under temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country&#39;s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when Yinglik&#39;s brother Shinawatra Thaksin was ousted as prime minister by the army.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the metropolitan elite joined the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 has practically paralyzed the country.
Nobody said that mussels would be better in a salad, I didn’t promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie laughs off.
We have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has long known: we say &quot;Belgium&quot; - we mean mussels, we say &quot;mussels&quot; - we mean &quot;Belgium&quot;.
Restaurateurs like to sagely state that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location, and again location.
There are places that are located not so well, but even excellently, but somehow unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe &quot;Gorodok&quot; (in honor of the same TV show), then &quot;Odessa-mama&quot;, and also the restaurant &quot;Beaujolais&quot; and the beer &quot;Friendship&quot;.
Now there is a pub here again, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg is located above the ground: a bar counter and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in a children&#39;s room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows there are TVs where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottled beers (170-1550 rubles).
The sociable-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, saying that &quot;mussels are hearty big seeds&quot;, and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, can foresee that the meatloaf with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, which is also cut so thinly that parchment paper seems ugly thick compared to it.
You can feel at least some taste only if you rake half a plate at once.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of withered iceberg, potatoes boiled a long time ago, sour Kenyan beans, stiff bacon chips plus pickled onions for some reason.
With such a Liege salad, you will not wish a meeting with anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not very positive.
If you could still close your eyes to unripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons, then why do mussels look like they have been thawed and boiled several times in their lives!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal White Sea mussels here!
They are served in saucepans &quot;in a sauce of your choice&quot; (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not work out.
There are vegetables, but there is no aroma, and whether there was wine there remained a mystery.
But frites with homemade mayonnaise relying on mussels are good.
Chicken waterzoi here is not a soup, thick to such an extent that, depending on your mood, you can decide whether the first or second course is in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the local chef cooked the rabbit in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned out everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during its lifetime, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful pear was attached to the rabbit leg - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery and the waffles were a bit dry.
But the manager who came up to the table in a very informal way asked about the dining impressions.
So it&#39;s worth visiting again.
The dollar exchange rate rose on the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
By 10:29 Moscow time, the dollar in settlements “tomorrow” grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro exchange rate rose by 30 kopecks to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks against the level of the previous close and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, and paired with the euro, and paired with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says Anna Bodrova, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, the rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed by either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to the forecasts of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in one chain.
Inflation is also predicted to accelerate: from 5 to 10% will increase to current prices in autumn.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and a certain vacuum will come, while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
“The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria,” comments Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department at Otkritie Broker.
They will still be watching whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, how NATO will meet.
The ruble, he said, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then the news on Ukraine went, in addition, the Central Bank last week announced that it would completely switch to a floating rate by the end of the year and refuse any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, then it was no different from the previous ones during this month, it was the mark of 37 rubles that frightened everyone, - the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Troubled times for the foreign exchange market were, let me remind you, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of the ruble weakening.
First of all, this is the growth of the budget revenue from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the rise in the cost of imports, says Alexei Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative aspects include an increase in the price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the reason for the rise in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country&#39;s economy.
In the equity market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths out the ruble-denominated decline in share prices.
For example, the MICEX Index during Thursday&#39;s trading fell by 1.67%, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative value of the decrease in the indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually fade away, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
&quot;We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,&quot; notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The Briton said she spent many years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Caryn Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking she only had a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another medical condition.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of hereditary disorders that cause damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait and tucked toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, meaning that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich&#39;s ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be wheelchair-bound by the time she was 18 and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, now 51, said: &quot;As a child, I knew I couldn&#39;t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me longer to do everything.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with other kids and was bullied a lot at school for the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to free her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical record when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
&quot;I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where it shouldn&#39;t and so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but I went back home and found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,&quot; she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in between.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk hadn&#39;t deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, &quot;My dear, I don&#39;t think you have this disease because you would be in a wheelchair by now.&quot;
I think you have something that poses a much lesser threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have CMT.
&quot;When he explained what CMT was, I thought I had drawn a lucky ticket,&quot; she said.
The UK charity CMT has launched CMT Awareness Month to try to raise awareness of the disease.
Tax Burden on Washington Zone Entrepreneurs Grows as Economy Recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid out $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion they raised in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden increased 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion from 3.9 percent a year earlier, marking the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years in which bills decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young and the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county&#39;s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland&#39;s tax revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is driven by a rebound in property values for companies, researchers say, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three straight years of less than 1 percent growth.
While large states such as California, New York, and Texas account for a large proportion of these receipts, the same appears to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up $9.6 billion from 2012 - up 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return of value to real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of company tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
&quot;What&#39;s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don&#39;t pay property taxes,&quot; said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent rise in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery in the real estate market.
Entrepreneurial incomes also seem to be on the mend, according to the data.
Companies in the region filed a $2.3 billion statewide corporate income tax, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although the trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
Growth in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a below-average rise in tax revenues of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), at 6 percent.
Maryland has a corporate rate of 8.25 percent, while the county has a relatively high rate of 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower state and local business taxes and an overall more favorable business tax climate than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation to cut its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to hit its tax revenue targets next year, this law could push the business income tax rate as high as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of personal income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure that most small firms are structured on - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much faster rate of growth. than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with state and local government sales tax receipts up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014. compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind as federal spending cuts weigh on the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home judo world championship brought the Russian team two silver and seven bronze medals.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday three medals were won at once.
In the men&#39;s competition in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze went to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion in 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarterfinal stage, triumphantly walked through the repechage tournament and won the bronze medal.
In the women&#39;s tournament in the category up to 52 kg, Natalya Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the reigning world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation at this championship and successfully defended her title.
In the dispute for bronze, Kuzyutina won against Ma Yinan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she nevertheless admitted that third place was not at all what she expected.
And again, Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship, became an obstacle on the way of the Russian woman to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg, put bronze in the treasury of the Russian team.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was the former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the award.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, and therefore will take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
It is interesting that another of his compatriots, who took UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, finished his performance in the category up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category up to 81 kg.
In a difficult battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men&#39;s tournament up to 90 kg.
Kirill Voprosov became its owner, and this medal was guaranteed to the Russian team: his opponent in the repechage final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: Voprosov&#39;s opponent could not enter the tatami due to an injury.
The hosts also won the men&#39;s bronze medal on the sixth day of the competition - Renat Saidov, who competed in the over 100 kg category, put it in the team&#39;s collection box.
In the consolation final, he scored a clear victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men&#39;s and women&#39;s - were among the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But Russian judokas won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, in a bitter struggle with a score of 2-3, they lost to the main favorites of the competition - the Japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and a strong-willed one - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
The bronze match in the women&#39;s tournament developed according to the same scenario, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the team competition in Chelyabinsk, and after the tournament he congratulated the men&#39;s team on the silver medal.
&quot;Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,&quot; Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I&#39;m sure you can win against them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of a similar level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev missed the current tournament.
Of course, we are all big maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let&#39;s remember that if a person is in the top eight of the strongest in the Olympic cycle, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo,&quot; the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko summed up the tournament, quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team, as expected, became the best in Chelyabinsk, having won 11 medals of various denominations, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Championship will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers family hope for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
&quot;Thank you for your continued love and support,&quot; Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had gone into cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains &quot;severe&quot;.
The response has been broad, including numerous online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All kings can
The debut album of Royal Blood is on sale - the new hope of British rock, which brought rock duos from clubs straight to stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo have only been on stage for a year, but already have a BBC Music Award nomination, a tour as the opening act for Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their self-titled debut album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because this is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the &quot;new R&#39;n&#39;B&quot;, but about a duet of bovine-looking Britons playing with that level of volume and intensity, which was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
It was not in vain that the duo took a name for themselves, which until then could only be encroached upon by very desperate hairy metalheads, and the blood of which kings, as it seems to them, flows in their veins, is also understandable.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to new heights.
It is perhaps too early to make predictions about the success of this enterprise, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs that fit within a little over thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer&#39;s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some advantages of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: for example, the pilot single &quot;Out Of The Black&quot; is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to tap than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful &quot;Little Monster&quot; and the closing track &quot;Better Strangers&quot; with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a hard rock party, but when played back to back, they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And this is not necessarily a bad thing, quite the contrary.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not pretend to be the new Lennon and McCartney (rather they are aiming for successors to Motörhead), but they brought numerous rock duos out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, was created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the familiar format invented in the early 2000s by The White Stripes.
However, it&#39;s not only about the instruments, but also about the very approach to composing songs.
The heroes of the retrorock of the 2000s with great difficulty got out of the postmodernist paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already now sound so powerful and impudent that this pressure successfully drapes some secondary and stubborn musical material.
And after all, who said that rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Friday morning: An online retailer -- and a video producer and a hundred other things -- is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch&#39;s sale to Google&#39;s video service for a nice $1 billion looked like it was all set, and it seemed like a natural combination.
Founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, Twitch set out to be a general streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; &quot;YouTube for real-time gaming,&quot; according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And &quot;let&#39;s play&quot;, a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mostly old) games a &quot;Mystery Theater&quot; treatment, are already popular on YouTube.
Thing is, YouTube is mentioned a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It&#39;s a mystery why the YouTube deal fell through, given that he was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have for now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Scheer: &quot;We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster.&quot;
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim they&#39;d rather play sports than watch sports, it&#39;s hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick yourself.
It&#39;s one thing to look over a friend&#39;s shoulder at 3am as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view yourself can be a Do It Right recipe for headaches.
I agree that speedruns, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.
But unless it&#39;s a game or humor virtuoso, it&#39;s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique monthly visitors and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money from this?
It&#39;s hard to imagine Twitch fold into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just take over Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to have: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shire said, Amazon and Twitch &quot;both believe in the future of gaming&quot; and the channel is showing no signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectator sport.
A terrorist attack in 2004 killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
Over 800 people were injured.
We spent several days in Beslan.
We talked with the surviving hostages - almost all of them are now students, with the parents of the dead, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the &quot;Beslan Mothers&quot; committee Susanna Dudiyeva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the &quot;Society&quot; department Elizaveta Antonova, working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Vyacheslav Bocharov, officer of department &quot;B&quot; of the FSB of Russia.
What particularly shocked me while working on this topic was that it was as if those ten years had not happened in Beslan.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But we must not forget Beslan, and I hope we have coped with our task,&quot; Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of the Rambler &amp; Co holding, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin&#39;s stay in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, Yonhap reports.
The launch was made at about 10.30 am local time from the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 km, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians cannot be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma, providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the database of the legislative activity of the lower house.
Its authors were State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more efficient and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and respect for the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is being rushed by parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicating information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, based on a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian legislation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called &quot;black lists&quot; of violating sites - an automated information system &quot;Register of Violators of the Rights of Personal Data Subjects&quot;.
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the Liberal Democratic Party and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill submitted today to the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said that he sees no problems in postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storages of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, &quot;from Rostelecom&quot;, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and is already providing its servers, from the Mail Group, from Western companies that are already providing their servers today.&quot;
&quot;In addition, there are several independent data centers that are ready to cooperate in this area,&quot; he added.
&quot;If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will receive technological opportunities for placement,&quot; Levin summed up.
controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association for Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, &quot;the bill deprives personal data subjects - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation.&quot;
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism for informing the user about where the recording is being made, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory the specified actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the &quot;localization&quot; of personal data in other countries led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
A participant in the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when ice water was poured over her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
That ice-water bucket test went horribly wrong.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so hard during an ice-water bucket test that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabell Roberts screamed so furiously when ice water was poured over her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
&quot;The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck,&quot; she told The Mirror.
Water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it did not close, it got stuck, and then the realization came to me that something was wrong.
Then the same understanding came to my mother and sister and they began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old UK woman was taken to the hospital to have her jaw set after participating in a popular craze on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The &quot;Army of Novorossiya&quot; claims that they shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 am on September 1, the militia handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead servicemen.
This was reported to &quot;Interfax&quot; by a representative of the press service of the &quot;Army of Novorossiya&quot;.
He added that &quot;air defense forces shot down a Su-27 plane in the area of the settlement of Mereshki, which violated the ceasefire agreements.&quot;
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the shelling of the Lugansk airport.
The representative of the press service noted that during the night the militia managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
&quot;Losses in the enemy&#39;s manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered,&quot; the representative of the headquarters summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the &quot;people&#39;s republics&quot; of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side, as part of the ceasefire, of 223 captured military personnel and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the &quot;Army of Novorossiya&quot;, &quot;stopped an attempt by the National Guardsmen, in violation of earlier agreements, to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area.&quot;
Then the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles in a short-lived battle, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk region in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the &quot;people&#39;s republics&quot; to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy hand over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen servicemen began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to Semyon Semenchenko, commander of the encircled Ukrainian territorial defense battalion &quot;Donbass&quot;, another 14 people came out of the &quot;cauldron&quot; on Sunday night.
On his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are &quot;captured by the 137th regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation,&quot; where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Ministry of Defense denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The message of the Russian foreign diplomatic department says that the &quot;conclusions&quot; of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support of the Kyiv authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on &quot;absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,&quot; the agency&#39;s website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry expresses regret that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is being influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged &quot;dialogue between the warring parties,&quot; the agency emphasizes.
Also on the agency’s website it is noted that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
Recall that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with US officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures introduced by the period of validity and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
Also, the Australian government announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Tricky Ways to Save Money on University Textbooks
With college textbooks costing over $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system for borrowing books from undergrads, offering them nominal compensation to delay selling them.
&quot;My Calculus textbook, which normally costs $180, I got a $10 semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie,&quot; says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
Required literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
The average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, according to the College Council, but students have a range of options to cut those costs.
Students are increasingly opting for online shopping and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, and are often substantially cheaper than buying them.
Nibo, Inc., which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed during the past spring semester, says Nibo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to get a good deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler has a list price of about $290, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 from Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Buying used
If you don&#39;t mind someone else&#39;s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis sells for $93.49 pre-owned on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business.
The book was selling for $48 new.
Educators such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, suggest that students check with their professors to see if previous editions can be used.
Sometimes updates are not essential to classes.
In such cases, older editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
rental
It&#39;s worth considering renting textbooks if you handle them well enough, don&#39;t forget to return them, and don&#39;t want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save over 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Calculus for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you borrow books, including any fines you may be charged for marks, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Renting Calculus on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says literature students can often find the best prices, as many classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and engineering literature can be quite expensive.
Regardless, take a look.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN to find out book prices, as this ensures you&#39;re looking for the exact text you&#39;re looking for.
Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check to see if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed by four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the university bookstore.
Putin announced the complete inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
&quot;15 billion rubles remained on deposits,&quot; the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to expedite the approval of the list of priority development areas in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of ASEZs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, until July 1 did not approve the list of priority development areas in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, the removal of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form priority development areas that should become competitive with key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
Let&#39;s remind, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone&#39;s The Expendables 3 returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For only returned $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz&#39;s &quot;Home Video&quot; brought in only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children&#39;s films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 are also disappointing in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children&#39;s films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the &quot;worst&quot; year ever for children&#39;s films and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely &quot;functioning&quot; fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a somewhat older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each film with a summer release of at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20 in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that this year&#39;s crop of films is similar in caliber to last year&#39;s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Internet streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter: &quot;I think times are changing.&quot;
We must recognize this and not try to chase what was before.
In contrast to the current box office decline in Hollywood, Netflix&#39;s revenue from the streaming service hit $1.2 billion, nearly doubling last year&#39;s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg slammed studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the &quot;collapse&quot; of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth in his dire predictions.
With several potential box office hits set to release in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Park, others in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the box office drop &quot;cyclical,&quot; telling the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one is going to worry about it.&quot;
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but Russian suppliers are a nightmare for European and Japanese restaurants.
And in general, public catering still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
&quot;It&#39;s better to eat lightly salted cucumber than bad mozzarella,&quot; Mariano Valerio, head chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti, laments the quality of cheeses that suppliers offer him instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ran out first in the restaurant, they have a short shelf life.
Stocks of parmesan should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was lying on carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that we would never buy anything in Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don&#39;t know, maybe things have changed there now.
But the other day they brought me fish from the Far East for testing.
So she turned out to be rotten!
I said that I don&#39;t even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things that are usual for Italy are a curiosity for a Russian manufacturer.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It should sag to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I have done it all with local beef.
Then they asked me: where did you get such tender meat?
I said: it&#39;s yours, Russian!
Why doesn&#39;t anyone do this?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant &quot;Brasserie Bridge&quot; in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Strelka bar, Regis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: &quot;Cauliflower - 200 rubles!
I ask: &quot;Why, on what basis does it cost so much?&quot;
They answer me: &quot;Well, we also need to earn money.&quot;
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price, this is a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard story: &quot;The first three months everything was fine, then the quality dropped sharply.&quot;
Main complaints: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don&#39;t know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, poultry meat and offal, deli meats, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
Restaurants began to leapfrog with suppliers: food prices have risen, it is urgent to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the strongest impact on expensive mono-cuisine restaurants in France, Italy, Spain, where food was supplied directly from the &quot;mother&quot; countries.
Public catering had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when at the beginning of 2014 the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers have established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions turned out to be much more severe.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to a presidential decree that remove Atlantic salmon and trout fry, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sweet corn, peas and onions for sowing from the ban.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes that the sanctions can still be eased.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to Vostok-Zapad, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
&quot;Expensive restaurants will have to change their menus to match what local farmers and other countries produce,&quot; says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of the Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, this will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Most restaurant is ready for this: 10-15% of the dishes will have to be abandoned, another half of the menu will be reworked.
Mixed cuisine restaurants are already beginning to replace dishes, such as marbled beef steak, with beef stroganoff, Sergei Mironov says.
&quot;Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,&quot; says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated for by the products of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to reorganize than for the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian go there.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project establishments, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace it,&quot; says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing a lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also quite a few restaurants that are practically unaffected by the sanctions.
These include establishments with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
&quot;There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,&quot; says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the Wai Me! cafe.
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens.&quot;
So far, not a single dish has been removed from the menu in Kolbai&#39;s establishments.
Timur Lansky, the owner of Chaihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will only have to exchange lamb for New Zealand.
If Russia arranges imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe,” he says.
From the CIS, you can get tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruits cheaper.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than &quot;plastic&quot; from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are tasty and sweet.
Nobody talks about Spanish like that.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruits and vegetables to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants that responded to Deneg&#39;s request also react quite calmly to the sanctions.
The press service of McDonald&#39;s said that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia sourcing department, the chain buys about 80% of its products from Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are made from imported raw materials.
In &quot;Teremka&quot; &quot;sanctioned products&quot; in general took no more than 4%.
Sanctions did not affect the noodle &quot;Wokker&quot;.
KFC, Burger King and Kroshka Potato did not respond to Deneg&#39;s request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald&#39;s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On your pinky
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to increased demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“The prices for products for Grablya increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice,” says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
&quot;East-West&quot; does not deny this: &quot;For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August.&quot;
&quot;Brazilian suppliers have nearly doubled the price of pork,&quot; complains Sergei Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken legs have risen in price by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, says Rak.
According to statistics, the growth in catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: so far, most restaurateurs have stocked up on food for the next two months in the hope of waiting out purchase price fluctuations.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with a cheerful name &quot;There is a time to eat&quot;.
“In general, we had been planning to make a holiday of local food for a long time, and then just the sanctions, we hurried up, organized a festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, Greek chef Anastas prepares a pasta salad and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borscht with caramelized apples.
All from Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin State Farm near Moscow, cheeses from the Russified Italian Jay Close.
“Salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced with other salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the Svoi Lyudi fish shop.
We catch sockeye salmon, chum salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon, chinook salmon - &quot;royal salmon&quot;.
Yes, they are not as fatty as Norwegian salmon because they are wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands - it does not even move.
And you can&#39;t hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments without any special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent there are shrimps with the label &quot;Magadan&quot;, cod, omul, whitefish, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The Svoi Lyudi shop has been operating since 2012, it sells fish through an online store, and before the imposition of sanctions, it served dozens of other restaurants, such as Simple Things.
Now Galkin has received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he gets excited.
We froze, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation, in Galkin&#39;s tent they are preparing a portion of &quot;Philadelphia&quot; with chum salmon for me.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these take longer to chew, but the knowledge that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
There are even halibut and sea bass rolls on the website of the Svoi Lyudi shop.
In sushi bars, however, they prefer to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are too lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
&quot;Suppliers haven&#39;t offered us Russian fish yet,&quot; Dmitry Evseev, owner of Killfish Bar, gives his explanation.
The situation is approximately the same with other products: Russian manufacturers could fill the vacated niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can rather talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers from other countries will benefit from the ban in the first place,&quot; says Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald&#39;s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
&quot;We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the speedy opening of restaurants for visitors,&quot; the press service of McDonald&#39;s told Dengi.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If they start closing McDonald&#39;s across the country, the scenario will be very different.
&quot;Europrotocol&quot; instead of a traffic police certificate
Casco payments can be received without a certificate from the traffic police - this is how the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines, according to which, from September 1 this year, in order to receive hull insurance payments, an insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
True, we are talking only about those cases when the accident was formalized according to the &quot;European protocol&quot; without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in an accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit, and both drivers reached an agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the payment limit under the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often, even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued according to the &quot;European protocol&quot;, the drivers involved in the accident call the traffic police.
After all, if you had a hull insurance policy, it was impossible to get a refund on it without a certificate from the traffic police.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are precisely designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; in Russia.
According to them, the maximum hull insurance payment in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit according to the &quot;European protocol&quot;.
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the hull insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both traffic police officers and the road.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of an increase in fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for Casco payments.
As for the drivers, it&#39;s hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the primordial Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will wait for hours for the inspector to file a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat the scammers or to convince drivers of the reliability of the &quot;European protocol&quot;.
The savings certificate will be made nominal and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates to the bearer, but it will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Treasury is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since there is no need to make deductions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the DIA, control 98% of the profile market, will suffer from it.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the estimates of the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, they explain in the DIA, is that the clients of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, if their license is revoked, try to get money from the DIA.
Some savers, lacking sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of a bank&#39;s license being revoked can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to collect insurance compensation through the courts,&quot; the DIA said.
The problem is, of course, illusory.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, since they have no right to compensation from the state by law.
If the point were that the instrument was not insured in the DIA, metal accounts would be banned along with it, on which citizens&#39; funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but so far no one encroaches on their existence.
The point, most likely, is that bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which can actually act as quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out, such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must be a registered security, which must be kept in a depository.
And to sweeten the pill for banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early redemption.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable deposit is being introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from everywhere from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 Milan man-portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges for them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles to Iraq.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, a decision was made to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1, Mrs. Merkel will address the Bundestag with a government statement on this subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to &quot;hot spots&quot;.
The opinions of the inhabitants of the FRG regarding the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the &quot;Islamic State&quot;, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militia shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoye (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media report about the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
Teenagers taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were airlifted to safety by helicopter after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went hiking shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called the police around 8 pm when they did not return home.
A search party was sent out, including local police and a rescue team, and the pair were found around 11 pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and hurt his head.
The officers stayed with the pair overnight and were winched up on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two alliances met
The talks at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Albeit on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine brooks no delay), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of &quot;hot problems&quot; for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who skimmed the cream off this summit.
Questions on this score disappeared on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them other Eurasians with Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenka on television news.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of polished courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who just hit the jackpot - and is planning a dignified old age in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenka helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) at once, who met with Lukashenka and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf, is not just the legitimization of a president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
&quot;The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenka gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to unfreeze,&quot; he told Ogonyok.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparing for a breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kyiv - in the summer of 2013.
&quot;Results were also achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization,&quot; Ogonyok&#39;s interlocutor lists, &quot;and negotiations were held with the United States on international security.
The states have even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the leadership of Belarus to them only spurred this process on.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the pro-Russian militias in the Donbass to be punished with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow either.
Minsk has not withdrawn from either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenka&#39;s move towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often Minsk will have to host meetings in the EU + CU format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton&#39;s press secretary Maya Kosyancic only told Ogonyok that, against the backdrop of resolving issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in the new format.
A drop in the ointment for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it turned out that he was personally asked to do so by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not opposed to Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the &quot;last dictator of Europe&quot; is acquiring the status of a completely handshake European leader who helps to solve a global problem.
European farmer&#39;s best friend
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included European commissioners for trade and energy, prompted the conclusion that the main reason for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable drawn up at the meeting for future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the fears of the CU countries on an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement on a larger scale than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, indicated that EU representatives &quot;came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, and not vice versa.&quot;
It seems, however, that in the economy, too, the crisis in Ukraine is &quot;working&quot; for Belarus.
Its consequences - and, above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are put forward, for which Vladimir Putin scolded Minsk at the summit.
&quot;The initiators of these schemes,&quot; Romanchuk told Ogonyok, &quot;are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
For a long time they worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, - the expert continues, - is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to setting up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in great demand.&quot;
According to Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenka from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow&#39;s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This can raise Lukashenka&#39;s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk denies its active role in the birth of the CU + EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
&quot;It was your proposal to get together, to discuss without any bulk, not to make a decision out of the blue, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time,&quot; he addressed Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when organizing interaction between the EU and the CU on its soil, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation of a common economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
&quot;This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, are put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation,&quot; Ogonyok was told at the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, a department where words have been scrupulously chosen lately.
Zones with paid entry may appear in Moscow
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of dealing with congestion on central roads, by analogy with other major cities in the world, M24.ru reports citing Moscow Deputy Mayor for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proven successful is entry fees.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the minuses and pluses.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made on this matter,&quot; Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor emphasized that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and workload, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the ongoing construction of a central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient bypass infrastructure, then it would not be necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow,&quot; the deputy mayor noted.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking has significantly relieved the capital&#39;s streets.
And, according to him, the city authorities do not plan to stop there.
Recall that on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TsKAD).
Sinful boredom
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez &quot;Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For&quot; did not revolutionize at all what one could expect from it.
The first Sin City (2005), filmed with a minimal but symbolic contribution from Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain &quot;thesis - antithesis - synthesis&quot; (if we understand the universe of noir by thesis, and the cosmos of comics by antithesis).
From now on, it should be read: &quot;thesis - antithesis - chaos.&quot;
&quot;Sin City-2&quot; is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first &quot;City&quot;, although, here, the thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life in the electric chair, but here, nothing, he just manages to grab - in the role of a kind of people&#39;s combatant - knives and other axes with nooses.
But the old men are literally pushed by the elbows of the newcomers, as if breaking into the city from some other film, the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry about.
So, its own story, shamelessly cut off by the authors at the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
The lustfully frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and Dwight (Josh Brolin) who is avenging her for something have their own.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, cannot be distinguished by sight from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, are demolished with inexorable regularity - is not a problem, and not even half the trouble.
Well, these are not people, we understand that these are noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, an overly self-confident player, a detective who has fallen into the &quot;honey trap&quot; of sex, a corrupt senator ghoul.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and drives the archetype, then this is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
Besides, even in this hectic world, there is something constant.
The fighting whores from the first &quot;City&quot; still hold all-round defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan, no, no, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always a pleasure to look at.
The main problem of &quot;Sin City-2&quot; is different.
Frank Miller was good because, as a draftsman, he skillfully combined comics and noir, and as a director, he turned the idea of \u200b\u200bhow to transfer comics to the screen.
Comic and noir are two aggressively opposed &quot;realities&quot;.
The modern comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, at the same time that Dashiell Hammett&#39;s novels Bloody Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931) created the canon of noir, then called hard -boiled school - &quot;cool school&quot;.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - a spinach devourer who gives him heroic strength, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other &quot;avengers&quot;.
But in any movie based on comics, there was something flawed: drawn characters stubbornly did not want to acquire on-screen flesh, remained pretenders in the &quot;real&quot; world surrounding them willy-nilly.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of &quot;existence&quot;.
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsytes, what Thibauts and Rougon-Makkars, what even Bolkonskys and Rostovs are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of a soap opera, and a crime - that is, marginal by definition - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned the hard way what it is to work as an orderly at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, Edward Dmitrik were at least close to the Communist Party.
Therefore, noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is almost an American version of socialist realism.
The first &quot;Sin City&quot; was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally, but organically combined comics with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not at all embarrassed by its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a &quot;real&quot; movie.
The gloom of a venal world, where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered for the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammett&#39;s pen.
And the picturesque details like severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of The Black Orchid and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of neo-noir.
&quot;Sin City 2&quot; is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical Miller-Rodriguez style to the comic book tradition.
Probably, in many respects this happened because of 3D technologies.
When you watch the second &quot;Sin City&quot;, you feel yourself enclosed in a glass ball, inside of which snow fills up a toy cesspool.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody lumps, but by and large, what&#39;s the difference?
Well, there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere, sometimes, even on the side of a dirty swamp, there is a normal world where you can return a girl who has gone along a crooked path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished .
When in the city of sin there is no place for anything but sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring as usual.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
In fairness, domestic rental gave this insipid sin a small, but peppercorn.
The credits warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode of which a person&#39;s fingers are broken with tongs, this smacks of hellish humor.
Hammett would love it.
France&#39;s socialists should &#39;shut up and put France in order&#39; says key ally Frasois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to &quot;show warm regard&quot; for the under attacked socialist president, whose reshuffle has not been overwhelmingly approved by the French.
The President deserves everyone&#39;s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
&quot;It&#39;s our duty to stay by his side,&quot; he said, drawing applause.
As a gesture of conciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question France&#39;s controversial 35-hour workweek, despite conflict-inciting proposals, it should loosen rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week. .
On Saturday M. Hollande pleaded with his comrades in the Socialist Party to remain &quot;one&quot; with the government.
However, Christiane Tobira, Minister of Justice, put a spoke in the wheel by attending a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to &quot;lose faith in the future.&quot;
Marine le Peix, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she had no idea the new Walle government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande - naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last even a summer.
&quot;And the new one won&#39;t last the fall or winter either,&quot; Ms Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party&#39;s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France&#39;s ruling party survived a debacle in March&#39;s municipal elections, while the far-right National Front came first in May&#39;s EU elections.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is in danger of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Hollande&#39;s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sian&#39;s Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
&quot;City without drugs&quot; was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry for state property management against the City Without Drugs fund.
The department intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization. as payment for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Arbitration Court of the Sverdlovsk Region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the Region (MUGISO) against the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization. as rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which is why the decision was made to refuse consideration.
Representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain the reason for the absence, the head of the legal department, Maxim Titov, did not answer phone calls.
Representatives of the fund also could not be contacted.
Recall that we are talking about the mansion, which was occupied by the Foundation in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 on a gratuitous basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the contract for the gratuitous use of the premises of the memorial mansion as null and void.
According to the directorate of the MUGISO, the agreement did not contain essential conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then the foundation filed a cassation appeal against this decision to the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the fund began to pay rent again, the head of the city, Yevgeny Roizman, spoke about this.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided differently,&quot; he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, Yekaterinburg City Duma deputy Alexander Kosintsev, United Russia, suggested that the mayor of the city, Speaker of the City Duma Yevgeny Roizman, resign.
The reason was the criminal case against Oleg Kinev, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a pensioner and is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Yevgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of &quot;slander&quot; (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Sverdlovsk Region, where Anna Filatova, General Director of the Zashchita Legal Center, applied with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that &quot;this is yet another attempt to avenge the truth.&quot;
iPhone will be turned into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are more and more leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
With reference to sources, American media reported that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which a mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows you to make a payment at the checkout of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to integrate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make contactless payments using a smartphone and an appropriate reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced back in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that were members of the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC functionality, the Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using their Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple&#39;s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: the position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistrals to Russia does not change
Romain Nadal, spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, announced the unchanging position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistral-type helicopter carriers to Russia.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on August 20: “Today the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes Mr. Nadal.
So the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the worsening situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

National Security Council of Ukraine: seven servicemen were killed in the zone of military operation over the past day
Representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Andriy Lysenko said that over the past day in the combat zone in the east of the country, seven Ukrainian servicemen were killed, another 25 were injured.
The situation near Ilovaisk is extremely difficult.
Until the operation to withdraw troops from the encirclement is completed, details will not be announced.
Upon completion of the operation, data on the losses and the reasons for the current situation will be made public.
Those responsible for the emergence of such a situation will be held accountable,&quot; Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation near Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded, in more detail.
According to the representative of the National Security and Defense Council, &quot;everything possible is being done to return the servicemen who were captured,&quot; ITAR-TASS reports.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military moved away from the Luhansk airport in the direction of the Georgievka settlement.

Norwegian Cruise closes in $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world&#39;s third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire sister company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a $6.8 billion market value, access to luxury cruise ships and wealthy Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fall through.
Prestige Cruises owner Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), a private equity firm, also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources asked to remain anonymous as the talks are not open.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with US regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its present form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.

Hong Kong pro-democracy activists disrupt the Chinese representative&#39;s speech the day after the election was decided
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Sunday determined the procedure by which just two or three candidates would be allowed to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the support of a majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for the Democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has led pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge to stop Hong Kong&#39;s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing&#39;s release of a document outlining China&#39;s control of Hong Kong, in June, pro-democracy activists held an informal referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city&#39;s business center and staged a sit-in.
Li&#39;s briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Bureau in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress of China, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council, were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings throughout the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong Prime Minister&#39;s office in the afternoon.
The UK did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to attach 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is due to the desire to retaliate for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control on the west bank.
Gaza spokesman Sahib Arikat said the world community should hold Israel accountable for &quot;the ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&quot;
Putin demands from Kyiv to start negotiations on the &quot;statehood&quot; of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the country&#39;s east and immediately begin talks on &quot;statehood&quot; for the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to allow the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin&#39;s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has been pursuing since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to give de facto independence to the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya in order to move closer to Russia, not with the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the captured territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that harks back to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will happen in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and as government forces attack civilian settlements in separatist-held regions, is &quot;a prisoner of illusion.&quot; , reported ITAR-TASS.
&quot;We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there,&quot; he said.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy that had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to assuage fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the autonomy they need, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, &quot;because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.&quot;
The intervention of a Kremlin spokesman to correct a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of Putin&#39;s words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to deal with the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than openly seizing Crimea, where the majority of the population of 2 million are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to fight a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of its 6.5 million inhabitants are non-Russians, and pre-conflict polls showed widespread support for a desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have been discussing in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect Russia&#39;s mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia&#39;s main navy, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic seaside resorts.
The regions between Russia&#39;s Rostov Oblast and Crimea are also home to mines, factories, and foundries that produce essential equipment for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested during his June 7 inaugural speech that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to give breakaway regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels that Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.
Putin&#39;s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals follows new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks swept into eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This has prompted a major civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 that sits between Novoazovsk and a narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
&quot;We are approaching the point of no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign soldiers and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take specific measures; The leaders called for the drafting of tougher sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation in the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly being held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged Sunday for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian soil a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.
Nude photo scandal captures Aussie celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his distaste for hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence leaked online as a result of a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible is said to have close to 60 candid photos of The Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly had their photos stolen in the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It&#39;s terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hack was &quot;shameful&quot; and that those targeted &quot;feel like they&#39;ve been invaded.&quot;
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her topless by the pool.
Palmer&#39;s film credits include Love and Honor alongside Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Lawrence&#39;s rep told TMZ: &quot;This is a blatant invasion of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, tweeting: &quot;Posting pictures stolen from a cell phone is really no different than selling stolen goods.&quot;
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
Potential way to steal nude celebrity photos discovered
Mass hacking of celebrity accounts may have been done through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by The Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on the Github resource that allowed guessing passwords for Apple&#39;s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same combination of login and password Apple ID is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which the celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allowed brute force to find out the password from Find My Phone.
With this method, all possible combinations of characters are entered sequentially, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service, the number of password options entered is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user about a hacking attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about attempts to guess the password to their account.
The hackers found out the Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password guessing script was written for it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted a Hackapp user and he noted that the aforementioned vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that he had no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the &quot;stars&quot; account.
It&#39;s not me plz RT
Extraneous entries appeared on the Prime Minister&#39;s Twitter once again
Although there is no hard evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has already been a wave of malicious activity using this service in the past.
The hackers took control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter account of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also previously hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the manner described above, then the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to get Apple&#39;s comments on the Find My Phone vulnerability.
Putin grants Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The corresponding decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and turned to the Modern Pentathlon Federation with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cups, won the silver medal of the European Championships in the individual championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of programs in this sport.
She holds the leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Yekaterina Lahno, a native of Lvov, who is a two-time European (2005, 2008), world blitz (2010) and rapid (2014) champion.
As part of the Ukrainian women&#39;s team, the athlete became the winner of the Chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
ICR stopped investigation of Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (Investigative Committee of Russia) has closed the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This was reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and flight engineer.

Anger is the most versatile and functional human emotion.
An angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the USA have found out.
They described their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions — brows drawn in and down, lips stretched into a thin line, nostrils flared — are the same across cultures, and even blind children who have never seen them make them, said Aaron Sell, lead author of the study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has evolved to effectively handle disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his terms, and he conveys this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and turn to assault, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a &quot;bargaining emotion&quot;, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry facial expression should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thereby force them to agree as soon as possible. with its terms to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated faces with or without each of the seven elements of the angry face on a computer and showed them to informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or a protruding chin alone did not make the face angry, the participants in the study unanimously recognized the person depicted with such features as physically stronger.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one&#39;s own strength, forcing one to agree and obey.
A man flares his nostrils and purses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that puffs up or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
“Anger is triggered by the interlocutor’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes on a form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,&quot; said anthropologist John Tooby.
The Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the television and radio company &quot;Crimea&quot;
The Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization TV and Radio Company Krym.
This is stated in the draft government decree, prepared by the department, which Lenta.ru got acquainted with.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed &quot;to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment.&quot;
In particular, it is planned to re-equip the hardware-studio block, video walls, the central control room and the video server room with the allocated money.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, from the allocated funds, the company will pay for the use of a fiber-optic communication line (FOCL) and repairs to the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications.
The state television and radio broadcasting company Krym was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, the television signal coverage of the TV and radio company is more than 75 percent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, TV and radio company Krym received a license for television broadcasting in digital format.
