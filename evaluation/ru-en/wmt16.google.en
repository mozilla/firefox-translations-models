The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel for citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government for the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport and bring the social card settlement scheme in line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 FZ &quot;On the National Payment System&quot;.
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its use are changing.
So, the replenishment limit is now set not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - no more than 400 rubles in winter, in summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of a social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force with the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with cash remains the same - from the 24th day of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new procedure for traveling with a social card will have a number of advantages.
So, it becomes possible to keep a detailed account of spending money on a social card with an accuracy of kopecks.
In addition, it becomes possible to return credited, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers is becoming transparent, since now a citizen pays half the fare, and the budget reimburses the carrier for exactly the same amount.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds to the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million rubles are allocated in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, the teacher confesses to the murder of his girlfriend
During a 911 call, in an almost unshakable voice, university professor Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed officers to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there is a &quot;dog&quot; in the house, who is alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the deceased&#39;s family members can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note scrawled on white lined paper: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me.&quot; - said in a note, according to representatives of the authorities, signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history professor Ethan Schmidt. on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials learned of the shooting at 10:18 am.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, there would be one more victim: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, law enforcement officials were still trying to piece together the motives that prompted Lamb.
Information shared by investigators across the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped paint a portrait of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, said he had no charges of violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed his appreciation for the &quot;wonderful people&quot; with whom he crossed paths in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended the lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke highly of Lamba, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, &quot;like there was something wrong with him.&quot;
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he dealt with stress.
Previously, Lamb had asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some kind of health problem.
He has only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the doctoral degree Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;apparently, Mr. Lamb had something on his mind.&quot;
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Police were on Lamb&#39;s trail after he escaped campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber single-shot pistol in the backyard of a home one mile south of his parents&#39; home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car, engine running, was still parked in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to the house, although Johnson says she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb&#39;s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun-loving.
Carla Hairston revealed that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play the guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around,&quot; says Hairston, now 40 and living in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time by the time of the events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, &quot;I killed my wife,&quot; but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house with the back facing the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband, Sean O&#39;Steen, revealed that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter, now 19.
&quot;She&#39;s quite depressed,&quot; O&#39;Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O&#39;Steen said he did not date Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O&#39;Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room on the outskirts of Gauthier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for the few patrons.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
&quot;Just a happy couple,&quot; he said.
We had fun and joked with each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, taught seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended the University of Kansas at Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial candle-lighting ceremony Tuesday evening.
Schmidt&#39;s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to get our students back,&quot; LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was assisted by Associated Press contributors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was redacted due to a police statement that Lamb&#39;s call went to 911 after Schmidt&#39;s murder, and also due to the fact that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information about that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won&#39;t be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while the toy and baby retailer says it will allow full-time staff and temporary workers to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers nationwide, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase headcount from October to December.
Although the holidays are still months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are gearing up to hire temporary workers in order to have enough staff in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about &quot;date&quot; with Princess Diana
The premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; turned out to be a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royals to arrive, I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and then it dawned on me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me,” he said in the trailer for the soon-to-be-released documentary “Back in time&quot;.
The movie starts and it occurs to me that I am literally at arm&#39;s length and one fake yawn away from my date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; took place 30 years ago.
&quot;For me,&quot; Spielberg says, &quot;this is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie ever made.&quot;
&quot;Back in Time&quot; will be available on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia&#39;s military support for Syria that there is &quot;no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict&quot; and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the council&#39;s five permanent members - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France during this month&#39;s General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that disagreements in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, &quot;made the situation intractable.&quot;
Ban Ki-moon urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in dealing with the issue of the nuclear program on Iran and in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Isn&#39;t Joking
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But as hard as some Republicans try to undermine Donald Trump&#39;s high position in the polls, they haven&#39;t succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown a double-digit lead for Donald Trump, with some beginning to seriously ask what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of chances of getting the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was losing ground to the rising popularity of Herman Caine, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush&#39;s &quot;Political Activism Supercommittee&quot; and the economic conservative group &quot;The Growth Club&quot; recognize Trump&#39;s unrelenting power and are starting to take out their dollars to topple him.
Here are some polling numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn&#39;t just a phase in between:
Trump&#39;s sympathy ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University found that only two in 10 Republicans viewed the real estate mogul favorably.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail at the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there favor Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would accept Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be &quot;delighted&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; if Trump became the nominee.
Only two out of 10 say they would be &quot;upset&quot; if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be &quot;enthusiastic&quot; versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;disappointed&quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the candidate.
Most Republicans don&#39;t see Trump&#39;s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging rights and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the nation&#39;s first caucus in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he&#39;s the right person to be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he&#39;s not the right person to be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament isn&#39;t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely GOP winner was, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full exposure: GOP voters didn&#39;t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump&#39;s campaign compelling.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a spread is likely to play to the advantage of Trump, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He&#39;s tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson outscored the businessman by as much as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters say they&#39;ve changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just over half of pro-Trump voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and make a difference, and no one can really say that they will never change their mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump&#39;s most intense rivalry at the moment is with fellow underdog neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they&#39;ve changed their minds are likely to elect Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants &quot;rapists&quot; two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration has been a hot topic in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump&#39;s posturing will turn key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and hinder the rebrand.
But according to an ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration gets everyone&#39;s attention, it looks like Donald Trump will stay where he is.
Disappointment with the government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
SIX out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they also resent Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent &quot;furious.&quot;
The government will decide the fate of indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, RG reports.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the next year costs about the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and reddened?
Ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis ourselves.
The output is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet wipe for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
It is useful to supplement cleansing procedures with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), which thin the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingertips;
when washing off makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further thicken the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country&#39;s main nuclear reactor, the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, is operating &quot;at full capacity.&quot;
A message about this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any moment to respond to &quot;aggression and the nuclear threat of the United States,&quot; and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons &quot;both in quantity and quality.&quot;
The last test of a nuclear weapon was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have succeeded in creating an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove the mention of fraternal peoples from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He stated this during a meeting of the State Duma, the Russian News Service reports.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
&quot;It&#39;s a very long anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can&#39;t stand it,&quot; Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrain, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to &quot;God Save the Tsar&quot;, and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or not accepts refugees, but whether the root causes of this problem need to be addressed.
If the Europeans care about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
&quot;This is the essence of the refugee issue,&quot; he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach a consensus.
However, if we want real successes, they are impossible as long as people are dying, as long as bloodshed continues, and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
&quot;Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we can&#39;t implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,&quot; Assad said.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of militants of the Islamic State extremist group.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city staged a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become the leader in accepting refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to contain the influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite much higher numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut in Questions to Prime Minister session
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the Questions to the Prime Minister session is much looked forward to.
The new leader of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon address the Prime Minister&#39;s question session for the first time, facing off against David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will deliver the first of six allotted questions in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely followed by the press and Labor MPs.
He made the call for &quot;less theater and more facts&quot; in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn&#39;s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will come after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his speech at the annual convention of the Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to stand silent during the playing of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of Conservative members of Parliament and was the subject of several newspaper editorials.
Mr Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr Corbyn&#39;s spokesman said he &quot;stood in respectful silence&quot; and acknowledged &quot;the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain&quot;.
However, Mr Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labor leader to sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play on Mr. Corbyn&#39;s team, voicing disagreements on economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political divisions are also &quot;piling up&quot; in the Labor Party following Mr Corbyn&#39;s appointment to the European Union and the government&#39;s cutbacks on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn told the Trade Unions conference that the Labor Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the whole idea of restrictions.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow secretary for labor and pensions, said there was &quot;total clarity&quot; within the party that it was only opposed to the government&#39;s plans to cut the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader David Cameron will meet at the &quot;courier box&quot; in the past ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labor leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has &quot;drawn collective resources&quot; to gather ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington MP North said questions to the Prime Minister were too confrontational and would refrain from witty replies and barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing youth.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy secretary, would fill in for him on questions to the prime minister when he is away - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he has approached House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot;fair show&quot; political style often associated with prime ministerial questioning, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since first being broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of a leader&#39;s views, ability to run the House of Commons and reputation with other MPs, though critics say it has become a caricature and needs massive reform.

Pound sterling rises as UK wages rise
The pound edged higher on rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 rose on the back of an offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, net of bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as a postponement of forecasts for a possible increase in quotations.
The pound sterling was up more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
SABMiller&#39;s stock stood out, rising 20% on a bid from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world&#39;s largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Shares of Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury group Richemont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales data beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are back on track.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion in a share offering as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in paper and packaging group Mondi led the index down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs cut the group&#39;s rating to Sell.
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sportswear company reported an 83% rise in pre-tax profit in half a year to £46.6m.
JD Sports chief says higher salaries could hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means &quot;more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers&quot;.
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional job openings.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi&#39;s onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up wholesale food supplier has launched a campaign to protect market share for IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi&#39;s upcoming $700 million injection.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food vendors and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media, social media and on events like &quot;Adelaide Show&quot;.
Joining the campaign are retailers and IGA vendors such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo&#39;s, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, the day this wholesale food, liquor and household goods supplier will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There&#39;s a lot at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and are more profitable than Metcash&#39;s IGA chain in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be familiar route takers, so the market here is more favorable to IGA retailers than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia. states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and food sales with high fixed costs for Metcash could cost the company about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash food sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company&#39;s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to a business luncheon in Melbourne that Metcash “could very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglass&#39;s comments.
But a Metcash board member is believed to have contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash&#39;s food business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, is down 43 percent from 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales figures. and profitability.
Yet the company isn&#39;t giving up, spending more than $150 million a year to match retail prices with Coles and Woolworths for 1,000 items a week, helping IGA retailers reimagine their marketplaces, and offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded products. food.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price equalization and retail space refurbishment is gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will see its bottom line increase in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism, for her behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal involving his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more credit for his behavior than criticism, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healey.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo and often referred to as the &quot;Special Ks&quot;, was unwittingly thrust into the spotlight by Kyrgios&#39; embarrassing spat with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the platform had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating: &quot;Wawrinka should have laid Kyrgios on the shoulder blades, and I should have laid on the shoulder blades of this guy.&quot;
Ever since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his racquet after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from possible loss at the US Open, Healy has devotedly defended Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow competing against Sam Groth for the right to be second to Bernard Tomic in singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
&quot;I&#39;m very worried about one thing, which is that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict,&quot; Healy said.
He did break his racquet when he got a cramped leg at the US Open, but he&#39;s not the first player to break his racquet when hopes are dashed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn&#39;t be proud of it.
But in fact, he handled himself very well in rather provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure that he is trustworthy.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family, and I just think he was treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works hard, he fits in well with the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected off the court, he trains intensively, he is in great shape, he is a very motivated and developed young man, and I think it should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for the important match starting Friday, believing &quot;mutual agreement&quot; was the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra boy to return to the team as a long-term player.
&quot;Above all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not on the controversy surrounding [Kiryos],&quot; Healy said.
And I think Nick has come into his own very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray are proving, he&#39;s growing up in front of the public, he&#39;s made some big mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he&#39;s getting, but we&#39;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions. and it is necessary, I believe, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can reflect on them, and this is best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed its border with Serbia on its southern border on Tuesday and is detaining those who try to enter the country illegally to stem the flood of migrants pouring in.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants accumulated on the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Stranded indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people who fled the armed violence in their homeland pitched tents and settled in the area.
However, dissatisfaction grew.
As a police helicopter circled above them, the migrants shouted &quot;Open the border!&quot; and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared &quot;unacceptable&quot; the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,&quot; Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to be jointly responsible for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement would be reached whereby EU member states would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded that an emergency EU summit be called next week to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
A state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions has given authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to close roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said his country also plans to erect a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to cut off the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and EU border crossing point for IDPs, many of whom are refugees from wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection, a view that is at odds with opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which took effect in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed-wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for those accused of human trafficking.
&quot;Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to approve the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been observing the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
György Bakondi, Orbán&#39;s national security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border on the border itself, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, having driven a railroad car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Riots broke out at the main border crossing near the town of Rjoske (Hungary), as the Hungarians set up an office to let people through inside a metal container, and crowds of people crushed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nationwide nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent) and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he intends to run for president, is getting the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months into the primary race, most Democratic voters say it&#39;s too early to say they&#39;ve decided which candidate they&#39;ll support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographics and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but that lead has dwindled.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party&#39;s nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, current Clinton supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question why they want her to run, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it is time for a female president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the post. (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called consent on issues and chances of being elected.
As the vice president mulls a potential run, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race -- though a third think he shouldn&#39;t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party&#39;s nominees, Democratic primary voters name Biden most of the time.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would pick Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
By this measure, Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, when asked what matters most in a candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than their chances of being elected.
Similar to last month, no Democratic or potential candidate is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, performed well in some key characteristics among their party&#39;s primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads the pack in honesty, and Clinton&#39;s forte is her leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden&#39;s ideological views as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#39;s personal email account and server continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that it did not negatively affect their overall opinion of her.
But that&#39;s a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn&#39;t affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party&#39;s voters, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, score well on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush rank best for honesty.
Most see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson close to Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates won half of the popular vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump en masse, whose support percentage has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll on the eve of a Fox News debate last month to 27% in a poll taken on Tuesday.
But Carson soared from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also showed that Carson has support across all demographics, edging Trump out of college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, fell back along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place together with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, taken in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson&#39;s rise in the polls showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32%.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
With Carson&#39;s rising support last week, Trump made some critical jabs at the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump&#39;s faith.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday during the campaign close in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch college freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Poconos, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
&quot;Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of New York&#39;s Baruch College brutally assaulted Chan &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death,&quot; police said.
Officials say the student, blindfolded and wearing a 30-pound backpack with sand on his back, was pushed several times as he tried to reach his destination by walking on the slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the P fraternity Delta Psi did not call 911 when Deng collapsed and waited another hour, presumably, before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity&#39;s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
&quot;At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity over the health of Michael Deng,&quot; Chief Wagner said.
They couldn&#39;t save him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
&quot;Too many families have been affected by initiation rituals as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970,&quot; Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury leaned in favor of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with rape of a newcomer and conspiracy.
&quot;We want to hold accountable not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this officially or unofficially, then her,&quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local chapter from its structure.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
This we know.
What we don&#39;t know is how long it will take before the onset, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Fed&#39;s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the administration of the US Central Bank is so emphatic that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long the adjustment will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about rate hikes is exaggerated.
&quot;The first rate hike by the Fed with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of &#39;cheap money,&#39;&quot; Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, told clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels, will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy may have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for rate hikes can lead to volatility for a while.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
&quot;Equity earnings do not appear to have stalled for 12 to 24 months after the first bounce, which, again, likely reflects a delay in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve&#39;s rate hike.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 or so years is more likely to reverse sharply - about 14 percent - upwards in rates, remains fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (2.6 percent average increase), then returns to normal after 500 days. with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron&#39;s.
Deutsche says the result for equities tends to take a while to become more pronounced in the rate hike phase, and equity earnings start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play into them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point ever since the hike.
In 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 percent, according to Deutsche Bank.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will be for a long time, while in the third quarter it remains at a level of only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates amid such a volatile economic backdrop could be risky and raises the question &quot;whether this time will be different,&quot; Deutsche said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve all year long, with their eyes fixed on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC may have approved a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading suggests only a 25 percent chance.
&quot;In our study from 1950, all rate hikes to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage, with GDP overlapping pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of recovery,&quot; the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is currently the longest the Fed has seen since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, in total it has been going on for 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile as the market anticipates rate hikes, a scenario somewhat similar to that of equities.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to reverse vector immediately after the first rate hike/cut in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall, Deutsche reports.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe the rate hike will cause long-term and short-term bond yields to converge, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although &quot;we are still wary of yield fluctuations,&quot; Cathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in a study.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the expected outcome of the Fed&#39;s policies.
&quot;In addition to a stronger dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve has flattened, credit spreads have widened, volatility has risen - all characteristics of a market with a tightening of Fed policy.
Generally speaking, companies with a core business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with lots of debt will be worse off as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt more expensive in the financial arena.
&quot;History shows that &#39;quality&#39; stocks outperform market within three months of the initial rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients.
Financially sound companies outperformed financially unstable companies in each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on equity, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed low-quality stocks by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure stock deals, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
&#39;BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM&#39; says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for &quot;lowering standards&quot;
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial competitor
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is just ripped off the Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who attacked The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
&quot;BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,&quot; the leader of the MPs said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it does anything that the commercial companies don&#39;t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that the public radio station seemed to be &quot;getting dumber&quot; and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial rival.
&quot;Radio 3 seems - I don&#39;t like to use the word simplification - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also set his sights on the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, look like The Brits under a different name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different, here are two examples that came to my mind first where you&#39;re really just copying what&#39;s already on the market,&quot; said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC CEO denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was way ahead of its commercial rival when it came to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don&#39;t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to performing live and making music is truly unmatched by anyone else.
&quot;It&#39;s also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new stuff,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the station has to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only brainchild of the BBC to be attacked for treading on the heels of commercial rivals during the Culture, Media and Sports Special Committee hearings.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22m.
See why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was done in &quot;typical BBC style&quot;.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to &quot;find a hit in its own home stable&quot; the next time it launched an entertainment project.
However, he does not see fit to prevent ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed to the maximum in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a seven percent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be monitored in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago through the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts Are Convinced That November&#39;s Black Friday May Have Helped Contain Spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain&#39;s main streets into ghost towns.
But experts say online sales are now showing signs of leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed the smallest increase since it began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five percent.
Experts say online sales are now showing signs of leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
&quot;If you look at growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they&#39;ve always made sense,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any environment, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it&#39;s plateauing and you can see a decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average shoppers rushed to their computers to take advantage of great deals, bringing down a number of merchant websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers get into a real fight for bargains, could make people refrain from shopping
Just over £1 in every £5 is spent online, according to a study published by the British Retail Consortium.
With regard to products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury those killed in a fall of a crane in Mecca, and sanctions are imposed on the Bin Laden family
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets as first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, the mourners crowded the road to pay their respects to the first of the dead, who made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mournful procession passed by the sacred site, where just a few days earlier, a construction crane had broken through the mosque&#39;s ceiling and fallen on the congregation.
The bodies were released for burial, and at the same time, the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshipers killed in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane jib up when the crane was not running.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by state-run Saudi Press, said the Binladin Group was partially responsible for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not give this detail, but said that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out why a crane fell into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go on the Hajj this month.
The Binladin Group made no statement regarding the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improperly coordinating actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been close to Saudi Arabia&#39;s ruling family for decades and has led major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have ordered one million rials (about £174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.

If you&#39;re good with a hammer or handy with painting walls, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to the company that owns B&amp;Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialist craftsmen to do simple housework.
Véronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns home improvement services, said the trend is being driven by a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock bottom prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmanship and close 60 B&amp;Q warehouse stores at the same time.
Ms Laurie said she would like to see more women on staff at B&amp;Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
Currently, most of the staff are male.
She said the latest demographic trends are also not to be ignored, with a growing number of households made up of single women doing more home improvement than in the past.
Ms Laurie said: “Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laurie, one of five women at the helm of leading UK companies listed in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of directors among men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Laurie said: &quot;It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women for the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took on the costs of store closures, Kingfisher posted a half-year decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&amp;Q brands, is opening 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the adoption of a crucial decision - whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who last week thought the Fed would do so now believe it will wait a little longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range. .
This is a historic event as it has been seven years since the Fed cut the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the possibility that a major bank could move off the ground and begin the process of normalizing interest rates,&quot; said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing well, the economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to brace for change, but everything suggests they are confident that the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
&quot;Open!&quot; - chanting hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other options for routes to the EU.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the town of Šidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers received orders from the authorities to proceed without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as secure as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is already a European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone can cope with this, and even more so such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone calls himself a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not do this, then they will not let him into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: &quot;Europe wants to help us.&quot;
Vangelis Meimarakis served for a number of years in center-right governments that, according to leftists, led the country into a financial crisis.
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
euronews: Nine months ago your party suffered a crushing defeat to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging by the polls, New Democracy has equaled its popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Greece was running a budget surplus nine months ago and looking forward to economic growth.
Now the country is again running a budget deficit and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was the case for the majority of Greek citizens.
euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs were or are still in operation, the political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the program on which they have agreed, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
euronews: Your party voted in favor of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country&#39;s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you honor this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece along the European path, because we have a good idea of what disastrous consequences a country&#39;s exit from the EU would lead to.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there were no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of the way Mr Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to restore order, act rationally and make it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that are not can be met due to the fact that they lead to a recession, can again be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to win back their trust, we must continue with the privatizations, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities we must open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example related to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers had never spoken about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table as Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have pushed reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary decisiveness and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell and there were no potential buyers willing to pay a price that suited the Greek government.
At that time I was the Speaker of the Parliament, I managed to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we have succeeded in bringing the country back to normal, which would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
euronews: In recent weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries that these people are striving for?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will have to deal with after we win the elections.
And the reason is that the government of SYRIZA did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should be proactive, because if the problem catches up with you, then only emergency measures remain.
And now we are in such a situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is receiving valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and mind you - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
An appropriate decision must be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more efficient border controls and refugee reception centers.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, within a day, employees of the criminal investigation department of the Main Police Department of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who the night before during the joint drinking of alcoholic beverages , and the conflict that arose in the village of Verkhnetoretsky, Yasinovatsky district, Donetsk region, fired a machine gun at his opponent.
A report about the injury of a 22-year-old boy came from the hospital, where he was hospitalized with penetrating gunshot wounds to his legs.
As Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the regional police headquarters, said, in the course of operational operations, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the person involved in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Operatives established that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to the man&#39;s head.
The investigative department of the Druzhkovsky GO opened criminal proceedings under the articles &quot;Deliberate murder&quot; and &quot;Intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm&quot; of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The defendant was detained and placed in a temporary detention center, the press service of the police of the Donetsk region reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced by a Russian court to prison terms.
Two more residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of freedom.
Residents of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received restrictions of freedom for 14 and 18 months.
The Leninsky Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and on Trikotazhnaya Street, as well as the memorial complex &quot;Monument of Glory&quot;.
In the latter case, the Katyusha rocket launcher and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of December 12, in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown people painted military equipment on the Monument of Glory in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov, Irina Leonova, gave birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
Recall that recently Tsyganov and Leonova broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater &quot;Workshop of Peter Fomenko&quot;.
Known for the films &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Space as a Premonition&quot;, &quot;Brest Fortress&quot;, TV series &quot;Thaw&quot; and &quot;Fartsa&quot;.
On September 8, Evgeny Tsyganov was recognized as &quot;Actor of the Year&quot; and &quot;Person of the Year&quot; according to the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
Man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he &quot;regrets&quot; the first murder and would like to &quot; return everything back,&quot; the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, say a professor of geography and social studies at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
on Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, &quot;I killed my wife last night,&quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot;doggie&quot; in the house who &quot;wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone&quot; but was probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: &quot;I&#39;m sorry I would like to return everything back.
I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and committed suicide on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police.
University rector William LaForge said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind.&quot;
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb had suspected an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials said on Tuesday there was &quot;no information or evidence&quot; about the &quot;love triangle.&quot;
Prentiss was described as a &quot;good man&quot; by Sean O&#39;Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remain friends.
O&#39;Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19 and that she is &quot;inconsolable&quot;.
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were &quot;best friends.&quot;
According to Lindsey Knowles, who the Sun Herald newspaper describes as a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said: &quot;She always wanted to help people.&quot;
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to say he &quot;won&#39;t go to jail.&quot;
On the evening of the same day, when the police overtook him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the forest and shot himself there.
Lamb received his Ph.D. in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to a resume posted on the university&#39;s website.
Stars that lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has gone through some difficult years.
In 2001 he was battling leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his life partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All this certainly played a role.
Manchester United&#39;s Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League game in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will keep him out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless tackle by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He has a double fracture and is in the hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It&#39;s terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
In the locker room he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I&#39;m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it&#39;s for six months, and the guy won&#39;t be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and no penalty was awarded.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it&#39;s worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle from two legs.
Shaw tweeted: &quot;Thank you all for your messages, words can&#39;t describe how devastated I am, my recovery journey is starting, I&#39;ll be back stronger than ever.&quot;
RELATED: Manchester United take on Luke Shaw after defeat against PSV
The English defender will have extra incentive to recover for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: &quot;This is a very serious injury.&quot;
When any player is out with an injury like this, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting the opponent, and when you hear that it&#39;s a very serious injury, you don&#39;t feel good,&quot; Koku said.
I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) had touched it, but I didn&#39;t see Luke rolling.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: &quot;I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
It&#39;s very hard for me and I&#39;m very sorry.
PSV&#39;s Andres Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it won&#39;t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you&#39;re David Cameron.
When asked by a representative of a children&#39;s holiday company about his favorite children&#39;s book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, a 1971 environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Seuss.
It was a tough choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: &quot;This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message that I love reading to my kids because it always comes up with some image or message that we skip.&quot;
And all is well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to be retelling the contents of the book, but is actually telling the plot of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
&quot;In the walled city of Vsemnuzhville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire - to see a real tree,&quot; we read in the text a description of a love story , unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodor Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn&#39;t look suspicious enough, Cameron&#39;s text reads almost like the Internet Movie Database&#39;s plot summary for The Lorax: win the heart of Audrey - the girl of her dreams.&quot;
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being an admittedly active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by the greedy tree cutter and necessities knitter Newhodkins, despite the protests of the Lorax (whose name is in the title of the book) - a funny creature with a mustache who &quot;speaks for the trees.&quot;
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to a performer who had never read a book about the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokesperson for Downing Street said the text allegedly came from Cameron&#39;s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text came from Cameron&#39;s headquarters, but there was no further comment.
There was clearly a risk for Adam Leath not to make the England squad, but it&#39;s still a tricky issue.
Beating Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but looking at the team that England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the last 3-0 Test defeat does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn&#39;t rule out a home win either.
Alistair Cooke&#39;s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has batsmen who are virtuosic on the balls and the collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
RELATED: Adam Leith dropped out of England Test cricket team to be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Leat is, of course, difficult for me, as his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyze.
There were two good attacks in his seven test matches in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by the umpires on the result.
There were no questions about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement because (and I&#39;ve said this before) players are best at picking themselves.
A couple of half-hundreds and Lita could have had a longer career ahead of him, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he picks up more runs for Yorkshire there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke highly of his attitude even when he wasn&#39;t at his best and that doesn&#39;t surprise me; he is first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before a Test cricket batsman leaves an impression is a tricky one.
Lit played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play home and away.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was at his best, but that lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up and he&#39;s a batsman that I rate highly.
He is an unpredictable cricketer, which is what we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow an extra spinner to be added while keeping four speed bowlers, is on the table, and I don&#39;t mind it at all.
I don&#39;t see any reason why a batting player can&#39;t hit the ball there, and this southpaw has already shown that he&#39;s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be quite right for his Worcestershire county, but he was number three for them, and there is not much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as the &quot;third batsman&quot; before coming out as opener in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and during my short communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his rough stats - an average of 31 at bat and 35 with ball - and think it&#39;s a risky bet, but there are few yes voters among spinners, and the sluggers opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahela Jayawardin, the Sri Lankan batsman, as test match consultant could have been a masterstroke.
He is one of the best guys for the game and will bring a wealth of experience to the game, gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and relentless pace in the setup.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say something that has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colley&#39;s Durham teammate Ben Stokes is on one-night stand, Ruth is given a similar break due to Australia and I, for one, have no problem with that.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
UK exit camp could win if economy in depression by 2017
David Cameron&#39;s ill-conceived policy of restarting negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more complicated every day, even without looking back at the election of the genius Jeremy - &quot;Is it yes or no?&quot; - Corbyn as Labor leader or the TUC&#39;s outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigels Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, with the EU now in the midst of a variety of crises - not all of them of its own making - some participating countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of divisive concessions and deal-busting changes they are in basically don&#39;t want to.
Meeting in Brighton for their annual meeting, the TUC decided it didn&#39;t want them anyway if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it &quot;Dave and George&#39;s selfie program&quot;.
The prime minister and finance minister ride around summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of a prominent local monument, with or without the company of a local celebrity, then come home and say they are enlisting allies for reform.
It&#39;s all about me.
My European buddy who wants an outwardly interested Britain under the awning of the European Union - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us with France,&quot; says Berlin - is suggesting that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals come to the understanding that when they don&#39;t care, stay we either leave.
Angela Merkel, the wary German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as it did for the long-staying Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kolya (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
It also loses power.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It&#39;s hard to see them go out of their way to help the &quot;selfie Brits&quot; whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don&#39;t want either, because most have similar secessionist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the UK&#39;s exit process, my friend suggests.
&quot;The revision was a fix&quot; and &quot;Britain gained nothing of value from the renewed talks.&quot;
Europeans know, to their misfortune, what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the media moguls are about the EU, unlike the referendum launched by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the hardened Euro-opportunist who became famous for his &quot;straight EU bananas&quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley crew of tax-afraid crooks, alien phone hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion about them, but he was aware that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you should give him bananas to distract him and prevent him from eating you for lunch and again. with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron&#39;s idea of a referendum, since Blair had traded principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him the winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him for any of this.
But lovable Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no more time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock&#39;s &#39;80s boycott Murdoch strategy - a mistake. both then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent press strategy - not with me, but most certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose Air Force couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official stance on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalistic Ukip trend and the wider &quot;Little England&quot; Tory circle can probably say &quot;yes&quot; to that.
It&#39;s the same as Hilary - &quot;Benn, not a bennit&quot; - Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout going out of his way to admit that Corbin&#39;s appointment of the obnoxious John McDonnell as a &quot;shadow&quot; treasury secretary was a bad thing. idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father fought hard on TV for being disloyal to his Labor colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
Hilary&#39;s battle was more attractive.
But the fight to stay &quot;under all circumstances&quot; - Benn&#39;s phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what JK told peers and MPs in a private meeting Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the Democrat and &quot;boyfriend&quot; Corbyn wants to say - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television, seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It&#39;s smart not to let Cameron get away with Europe so easily, allowing him to take for granted Labor&#39;s support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn&#39;s basic misconception about EU membership - within the &quot;Benni&quot; economy of a besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among dissidents on the left, for whom narcissism born of minor difference is a central tenet in dogmatic debate.
As for his delusions about NATO, Tom Watson is unshakable that J.K. will not campaign for withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when it might all be pointless?
The US is already quite frustrated with weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government in power is cutting spending, as I was reminded during lunch on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize Public Health England review of e-cigarettes
Claims by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are affiliated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) with the Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
PHE published a major milestone report last month, calling it a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence.&quot;
But some researchers questioned the validity of the data and pointed to some experts&#39; links to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the &quot;extremely shaky argument&quot; on which PHE based its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these claims had &quot;solid or shaky grounds&quot;.
Martin McKee, Lecturer in European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Lecturer in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: &quot;A fundamental principle of public health is that rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness.&quot;
The public expects PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking&quot; to be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling, they said.
In fact, this is inferred from a single meeting of 12 people who met to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis model in order to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also validated BAT certifications in healthcare in a sustainability report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, with no mention of the funding he had previously reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the choice of council members was not provided, but among them there are several well-known e-cigarette advocates, some of whom also announced industry funding in the publication.
It is not known if the other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the Head of Tobacco at PHE.
A scientific paper published by the group &quot;graciously agrees&quot; that there is a lack of &quot;strong evidence for the harmful effects of most products by most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were touched upon in the PHE report.
McKee and Capwell said that PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive to cause children or non-smokers to smoke&quot; are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellness at PHE, said the BMJ&#39;s claims have been answered in the past.
He said: &quot;Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.&quot;
One in two lifelong smokers died of his addiction.
All evidence implies that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence does and does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
Around 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By making clear the obvious - that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do a fraction of the harm that smoking does - we are fulfilling our mission as a nation.
Former Channel 4 chief says BBC should end EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for successful shows like the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson remarked that the license fees should only be used to make programs that were not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasters, which are likely to be seen by only a small proportion of the audience, at peak airtime when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to do more with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to work with the BBC while at Channel 4.
&quot;I can&#39;t help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programs that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies,&quot; Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don&#39;t think is a good solution in the medium to long term, then the company should only keep programs on the air that are not produced or intended to be released by other companies.
The Voice is airing in a prime slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is laughable and obviously absurd.
Johnson: &quot;I don&#39;t see why regressive taxes should go to fund shows that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would certainly give a lot for it.
I don&#39;t understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don&#39;t think it would belittle the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings &quot;because of employees&#39; ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.&quot;
His comments about the most popular shows on the BBC echo those of Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh, suggested that the BBC sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the BBC&#39;s more niche public service programs &quot;continue to go to BBC4, where audiences often cannot be measured, but the function of the company is done, and this can be used as an argument in sanctimonious sermons justifying £4bn in royalties&quot;. : &quot;well, yes, of course, we do all these obscure programs that no one watches.&quot;
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: &quot;I urge you to find a more regressive system as far as who gets the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge amount, but for people who £150 is a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don&#39;t watch or listen to the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should rethink Reet&#39;s mission in favor of &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC&#39;s output is now formally classified as educational - according to him, this is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto &quot;inform, educate&quot;. and entertain.&quot;
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms (only a handful of which he says are shown on TV) and forge alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available to the public. viewing online.
&quot;Sonogenetics&quot; allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have developed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are exposed to sound pulses too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the topic: Researchers control brain activity with light
The scientists said the worms are demonstrating the possibilities of a new technique called &quot;sonogenetics,&quot; which uses ultrasound to excite certain cells in the brain, heart, and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to a person&#39;s brain and is used to treat Parkinson&#39;s disease.
Nematode worms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then enter the body of the worms.
Amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called &quot;TRP-4 ion channels&quot; found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into the organisms of worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in &quot;optogenetics&quot; - a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain via fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unhindered through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to go inside the skull to deliver them.
&quot;We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in the clinical setting, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal,&quot; Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International&#39;s video protesting the weapons exhibition.
Awesome Killer Drones!
Shin-destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no marks!
The peppy voice and hand-drawn animations make it clear that this advertisement for the world&#39;s largest arms show is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government&#39;s intention to &quot;push&quot; weapons to repressive regimes by taking advantage of the exhibition of defense technologies and systems taking place at the ExCeL center in Docklands security.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters at bus stops and in subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
&quot;Important announcement, traveling on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?&quot; - written on one of them in London Underground fonts with the image of the DLR line turning into the silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will descend on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help stop the weapons display.
The 300 posters were designed by artists who exhibited their work at the &quot;Museum of Cruel Design&quot; in Banksy&#39;s Dismaland Park.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them around London using an &quot;Advertising Cracker Kit,&quot; a 6-pound wrench set that says &quot;gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet&#39;s bus stops.&quot;
Transport workers in London are unhappy with such &quot;vandalism&quot; in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads released by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs exhibition curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with protesters realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms exhibition poster welcoming passengers to the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro bono agency VCCP, with a freelance graphic designer and voice artist.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the commercial silence surrounding the arms show - with a gap in the ExCel calendar - and thought, &quot;Let&#39;s give them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They thought of creating a more realistic and clever corporate ad, but &quot;filling it at home with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;ve been incredibly helpful in bringing awareness to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the show,&quot; says Amnesty&#39;s Tom Davies.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not sold illegally right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative arms show-themed art comes from within ExCeL, where members trade fantastically euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It&#39;s been 11 years since I moved into college dorms as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints against others. .
Basically, what I have learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving into a hostel can range from slightly nerve-wracking to downright intimidating.
It encourages chatting: telling people where you&#39;re from, did you take sabbatical and where did you spend it, do you support Corbin and why do you &quot;honestly neither love nor hate Marmite&quot; because seriously guys it&#39;s just yeast extract HAHAHA, I&#39;ll be at my place.&quot;
Take a break.
And help others rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn&#39;t even talk to if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People&#39;s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and social hangouts, but they&#39;re also places for people to get dressed and straighten their underwear.
Related: Don&#39;t even think about going to university while in a relationship
Universities treat introverts unfairly.
Your room is supposed to be a haven, however many dorms create a culture of roaming from one room to the next, which encourages friendship, communication and long lasting friendships.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recuperate.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, &quot;I like you and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave so I can recover the energy I spent with you.&quot;
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and do not knock on his door, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you&#39;re starting university life at the height of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people&#39;s doors to introduce yourself and hand over a plate of chocolate chip cookies is not so strange an act, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their &quot;Welcome, we are neighbors , I baked something for you, now smile, and I will ask you personal questions.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to chat with you, and as a result, they will probably associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Bad lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Food theft is a typical crime in student residences.
Of course, appropriating someone&#39;s chicken is theft, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Check with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if inside is seething with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it&#39;s annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to be more mature than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
Now she is in jail.
You must not make noise that will disturb people&#39;s sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to turn down the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally quieted down at 5am, she graciously let him sleep for two hours before turning on her music and locking the door behind her, leaving for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extremely, to the point of biting your elbows, awkwardly, if you mistook a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away with him, broke off relations and would have to see him every day, and perhaps watch how he pulls all your friends over to his side. mutual friends?
Of course, you can’t command your heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool your own ardor.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never mess up anyone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else&#39;s door and dip your keys in a glass of water to put in the freezer - but don&#39;t glue someone else&#39;s stuff to the ceiling with Blu-Tack glue more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after the release of Apple&#39;s update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it&#39;s ready, the phone will let you download and install it.
Some have run into issues after installation where an error message appears telling them &quot;Application update failed&quot;.
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides or try to update via iTunes.
Hints on your phone will guide you through the entire process.
The process may involve uninstalling apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized this by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier with a utility that prompts you to uninstall apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It&#39;s worth making sure your phone is charged or close to a charger when performing the update to prevent the battery from draining.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because draining the phone in the process can cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russian military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia&#39;s military activity in Syria.
It is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that continued Russian support for President Assad runs the risk of aggravating and prolonging the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power,&quot; US State Department officials said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the US commitment to fight the &quot;Islamic state&quot; in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the United States &quot;would welcome Russia&#39;s constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State.&quot;
Last Friday, White House officials said that they do not know exactly what actions Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: &quot;When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise handset and will attempt to make the call.&quot;
Barack Obama himself considers Russia&#39;s decision to increase support for the Assad regime &quot;a losing bet.&quot;
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that this was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
&quot;But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened,&quot; the US president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
Elena Lashkina, Assistant Minister of Economic Development, told Izvestia about this.
In June 2015, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergencies, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, the Federal Tourism Service - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad - approximately €200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission &quot;On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Relief from Customs Duties and Taxes&quot;, providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating craft for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted for consideration by the subcommittee on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption upon importation is, in essence, a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, to be used in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. Among of them - office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, stage costumes and scenery, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestiya that they had prepared mandatory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registering the entry and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure boats to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the use of a simplified procedure for the entry of small-size, sports sailing and pleasure vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the Russian government on approving the boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are being coordinated, - the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and certification, state registration of small boats used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that yachting is extremely difficult in Russia precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, virtually everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht even has nowhere to refuel.
For two days she can go with her own fuel, and then the problem arises of where to get it, - says Denis Novikov, Sales Director of Nordmarine.
As for the places for storing yachts, there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Yachts are also sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are rich people, however, with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
The new funding will support a number of priority banking sector reform efforts in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine.
Qimiao Fan, World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, said banking sector reforms would help revive credit in the real economy and stimulate a recovery in economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the severity of the problems, Fan is calling on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a €100 million loan to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender people and transvestites in the colonies will be discussed.
Council member Vladislav Grib told Izvestia about this.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not decided on their gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks in domestic prisons, or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine citizens to serve their sentences in such isolated places only after the convicts pass the appropriate medical examinations, which prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that separating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in pre-trial detention centers (where the accused are kept until a court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions there are special blocks.
Today this is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a lot of problems for the employees of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Humiliation of trances by cellmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large the city is, how many criminals with an indeterminate gender, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Separate pre-trial detention centers are definitely not needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Grib explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transgender prisoners will be able to go there to serve their sentences from any regions.
Citizens are kept in a pre-trial detention center at the place of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, Grib believes.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officers could not decide in which pre-trial detention center - male or female - to identify 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), who was detained for possession of drugs, because of which the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on bail.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, since there really is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving sentences for transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to determine people in a colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Considering the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security for homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be made for homosexuals in the name of this, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to pass themselves off as transsexuals in order to end up in a colony that is different from ordinary ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in colonies for transgender people, but not everything is always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison he said that he wanted to change his gender, Alekseev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for serving sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will seriously think about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues in the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for distributing transsexual criminals in a colony could greatly delay the start of serving sentences for convicts.
A commission is being created - this is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test, on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today&#39;s possibilities of psychiatry allow this.
Therefore, potential patients always undergo such examinations before a sex change - they show exactly whether a sex change with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average, such an examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that he generally supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - there are only a few transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, then we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are an insignificant number,” Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people, and so can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Junior Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors under 20 has ended.
The ending of the championship turned out to be more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who nevertheless managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed to be confidently moving towards the title.
The Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa celebrated the victory among the girls.
The World Chess Championship, which has been held since early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue by the middle of the tournament distance, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds) confidently took the lead.
Considering that Duda was the rating favorite for the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the lead he gained seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to close the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the clear favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, had to win in the 13th round without fail.
But even that wouldn&#39;t help if Duda won his game.
Plus, this obligatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for Duda, who faced Benjamin Bock, to complete his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player ended the confrontation with the Dutchman in a draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible each, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalya Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But in the girls&#39; competition, there was no intriguing ending.
Tournament leader - Natalia Buksa (Ukraine) - to win the title it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she did with success.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second, 0.5 points behind the champion.
VimpelCom is changing its regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - into the Vostok region.
The project will be completed by November 1st.

In an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel, Mr. Slobodin specified that they intended to cut &quot;tens of percent&quot; of the staff in Russia.

Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that the agency is against indexing freight rates by 10% and providing state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says. -
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, &quot;much more stringent&quot; proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.

Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was entered into as part of Polymetal&#39;s purchase of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.

Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the targeted food aid program would not become an analogue of the rationing food distribution system that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase &quot;food card&quot;.
I would especially like to note that the proposed grocery cards should not be confused with an echo of the past times of total shortages, a distribution card system in which the number of products received is normalized.
So far, we have proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation,&quot; TASS quoted Mr. Yevtukhov as saying.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor has been submitted to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers &quot;Top 1000 Russian Managers&quot; is published for the 16th time.
Being a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of the previous year&#39;s ranking.
Last year&#39;s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year&#39;s rankings and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of the company&#39;s functional areas: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, personnel director, IT director, public and corporate relations director, government relations director, corporate governance director.
Each manager proposed by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new leaders from other companies.
Candidates are nominated according to the sectoral principle based on the sectoral classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, timber and wood processing industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, diversified holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a login and password to enter the www.top1000.amr.ru website, where they can see information about other participants and can put down their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the principle &quot;The best choose the best&quot;: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All interested candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of past years are invited to face-to-face meetings of expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of top managers and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At meetings of expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are classified information until the rating is published) or to make adjustments to update them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of &quot;Kommersant&quot;.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
A comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses sank by 40% in January-April this year.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic at the end of 2014 - beginning of 2015, the volume of SME lending decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could include all its possible problems in the future, from delays to defaults, into the increased rate, now it is impossible to do this: the rates are already exorbitant.
For businesses, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate level of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
To what extent, according to your estimates, is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans satisfied?
After the Central Bank lowered the interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to more closely monitor current results, control the movement of funds.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, it is worth using new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy supply costs.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is showing consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate in order to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the Central Bank cuts rates.
In terms of delinquency levels, traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in their ability to replenish cash and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly represent a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country&#39;s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new crossover CX-5, as, indeed, any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness it is attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese, simply by virtue of its &quot;Japaneseness&quot;, is able to bring attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can give arguments in favor of cars from other countries as much as you like, and a person will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: “But this is a Japanese car!
So there is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but also everything else Japanese.
Quoting Basho on the move, seasoning food with wasabi, collecting katanas and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and quite unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure even after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the exterior of the CX-5 is the grille with five horizontal lines.
But the new design of the headlights and taillights, by which the car is instantly recognizable in the stream of cars, changes the appearance of the car much more.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of severity.
You won&#39;t have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese calmness.
The 2.2L diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide speed range.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 liters. s. - only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped exclusively with automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add some dark humor to this look, you can choose leggings with print from police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has gone to great lengths to ensure that you don&#39;t end up in the scene of your own accident while driving the CX-5.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has been redesigned front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the bushings of the front lower control arms.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise at high speeds reduced by 13%.
A floral or striped swimsuit is just as boring as a budget sedan.
Another thing is if a girl flaunts in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the action role-playing genre.
Attention to her then get no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 features a redesigned seat both front and rear, providing optimal headroom for both broad shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even long-legged ones will surely appreciate that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in turns.
Mazda&#39;s widest range of active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is also adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, having a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats fold in a ratio of 4:2:4 - with each section equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of a cartoon character in Japan is called &quot;kigurumi&quot;.
Kigurumi pajamas look especially fervently.
Everything is possible in it!
Of course, sleep.
But still - to entertain small children.
Or just walk around with such an animal along the street ...
It&#39;s so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, demeanor or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material store Kawaicat.
Kyiv broke the atomic union.
Kyiv officially issued Ukraine&#39;s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday, on the second attempt, still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth units were signed back in 2010-2012, but the project was never launched.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnytsky NPP.
It was possible to carry out the bill introduced by the government of the country only from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then, during the second vote, 234 members of parliament spoke in favor of the draft.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, laid down in the USSR, according to the original project, was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW each with VVER-type reactors, but only two managed to be built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built with a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved was the purchase of fuel from the Russian Federation for operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (providing about half of the electricity generation in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NNEGC Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
The plans to complete the construction of the Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally abandoned: back in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kyiv.
The UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
&quot;There is no military solution,&quot; the AP quotes his answer to a question about Russia&#39;s military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
&quot;The meeting will be on Syria,&quot; he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
So far there are no such plans.
&quot;But anything is possible,&quot; said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that official Damascus needed military assistance to fight the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.
Read more about US doubts about Russian assistance to Syria in the article &quot;Kommersant&quot; &quot;Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington.&quot;
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
Artur Gerasimov, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
&quot;What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,&quot; TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and &quot;returning to the normal life of our countries.&quot;
When asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA platform - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue has been held, there are Minsk agreements .
At the same time, according to the politician, any kind of dialogue is supported in Kyiv.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, ex-president of the country Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played according to party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were made by representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who accused the election commission of &quot;covering falsifications.&quot;
The opposition&#39;s remarks were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral committee refused the Communists of Russia party to organize a referendum on the abolition of fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city electoral committee officially presented the results of the elections to the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voters were issued ballots for voting in precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 - lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of United Russia, six seats in the City Duma are given to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the Liberal Democratic Party was the leader of the party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of A Just Russia go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city electoral committee, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he was introducing duty to &quot;send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others&quot; with a view to refusing mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the Communist Party announced multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the City Election Committee with an advisory vote from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed not to recognize the voting results in four constituencies No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could get inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At meetings of district commissions, all observers and members of commissions with the right to consultative vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head stopped access only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
&quot;Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings,&quot; Natalya Andryushina, a member of the city election committee, retorted.
The communists objected that Lyudmila Aristova, deputy of the legislative assembly of the region, was illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also indignant that in a number of PECs on election day they began to seal the ballot boxes at 6-7 in the morning, putting ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right to an advisory vote and observers, so they arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the City Election Committee, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the stuffing of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from &quot;Fair Russia&quot; Maria Popova through the regional election committee to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time for opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
&quot;On your own initiative, contact the Central Election Commission,&quot; Alexander Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, Sergei Samokhin, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, attacked the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering up electoral fraud.
&quot;You&#39;re not at a rally here, be careful when you say!&quot; - offended the chairman of the electoral committee.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the electoral commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the election results, the city election commission refused to register an initiative group for holding a local referendum to the Communists of Russia political party.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring two questions to Nizhny Novgorod for discussion: do they agree that fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be &quot;immediately canceled&quot; and tariffs for housing and communal services &quot;frozen until 2020.&quot;
However, the Duma&#39;s lawyer, Irina Maslova, explained that the appeal of the &quot;Communists of Russia&quot; was contrary to the law.
FedEx Revenue Mixed, 2016 Downgraded
FedEx posted disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery service giant cut its full-year earnings guidance as demand for freight services slumped and costs rose in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-trading 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts were looking at $10.84 according to the FactSet survey.
The downgrade comes despite a rate hike of 4.9 percent on average, which will take effect on January 4, and an increase in ground transportation fees for heavy or oversized cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue to grow year-over-year thanks to cost reductions, higher gross income and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot;performed strongly in light of weaker-than-forecast economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number they hired last year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx made $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the $2.44 per share average forecast by Zacks Investment Research polling 12 analysts.
Revenue increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks suggested $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international express shipping sector, resulting in no gross revenue growth in its express shipping division.
However, the boom in online shopping dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the most recent quarter, ground transportation revenue rose 29%, but operating income remained broadly flat due to higher costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division saw higher revenue due to higher base rates, while the freight sector lost revenue due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary trading about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding whether it&#39;s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of an ornate conference room, two stories high, a wall painting of the United States will hang over them.
This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the country&#39;s economic interests ahead of all others.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the US and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in Thursday&#39;s near-predictable decision about whether the US economy is ready to bounce back from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show strong growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate - even by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
&quot;Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration,&quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve will do, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Roughly half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg were expecting interest rates to rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to hold off, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a quick recovery.
This could send the stock market down if the Fed raises rates, provided decision makers don&#39;t soften the blow with a promise that the next raise won&#39;t be soon.
The Dow rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85 on Tuesday.
The rise was fueled by expectations that Fed strategists will leave rates this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research.
&quot;It will be a surprise if the Fed raises rates at this point in time,&quot; he said.
If the Fed does so, &quot;they will have to go far in asserting their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don&#39;t panic.&quot;
Other experts countered that a rate hike could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be poised to raise rates by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to what the Federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation remains below the central bank&#39;s target of 2% for the year, Federal System officials said the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy &quot;can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average for industrial stocks fell as much as 16% from a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could dampen global growth.
The market has partly rebounded this month and the Dow is now about 10% below its high in May.
For the Fed&#39;s management, market disturbance further complicates the difficult timing of an interest rate hike.
&quot;In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have turned the screws on this meeting,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former staff member Federal Reserve System.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about what the implications for the US economy could be, and they have little to no hard data after recent events in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a primary concern of the Federal System, and technically should not be considered in these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve System has become the world&#39;s financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve might &quot;mute&quot; its monetary expansion sent markets around the world into turmoil.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, one would expect Federal Reserve officials not only to monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to better understand the world economy. .
Their decision-making process is &quot;more of an art than a science,&quot; said Zachary Karabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc, a global wealth management strategy company.
Jeffrey Lucker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that &quot;there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve of overreacting to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles.&quot;
Lucker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia resulted in the Fed cutting its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, &quot;despite limited identifiable impacts on US growth,&quot; Lucker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should only prioritize stability concerns in times of major crises, such as the market crash in 2008,&quot; said Adam C. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s interest rate committee.
The latest panic never came close to that level, he said.
&quot;You certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be in a situation where you&#39;re scared of rising rates because the markets are going through a turmoil,&quot; said Posen, president of the Institute for World Economics. Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act is still dual mandated and doesn&#39;t mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don&#39;t think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees flood into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
&quot;I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises by itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic persistence, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?&quot; he asked.
&quot;After all, someone probably assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, will rush to prosperous EU countries,&quot; he added.
Naryshkin asked: &quot;Have many political leaders of Europe spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally overwhelming their countries?&quot;
&quot;No, the old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,&quot; he stated.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
&quot;Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially looked and is looking at how military boots, sewn according to NATO standards, are trampling on moral ideals and the basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,&quot; the speaker stressed.
Government troops and paramilitaries loyal to them are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group &quot;Islamic State&quot; banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The United States supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the reason for the West&#39;s hostility to Russia.
The claims of the West to such countries as Syria, Russia and Iran are, in fact, that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Rossiya 24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West. &quot;.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West&#39;s constant statements that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, then at the request of the people, and not by decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or Geneva communiqué.
&quot;If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately,&quot; he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria also fights terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
&quot;Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,&quot; he explained.
As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
&quot;We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States,&quot; Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group &quot;Islamic State&quot;, banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States inflicts air strikes on ISIS positions.
Flooding in Utah has killed 12 people.
At least 12 people have died as a result of flooding in the US state of Utah.
Another is considered missing, according to Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
Water washed away several cars with people in them in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the current suddenly overtook him.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All the dead are residents of the Colorado City and Hildale areas, which were hit by the elements.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in search and rescue operations.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria Russian news EN
US Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters, citing State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to &quot;further isolate Russia&quot; if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, in the course of his conversation with Kerry, once again emphasized the need to create a united front in the fight against terrorist groups operating on the territory of this country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were touched upon.
Earlier, US officials said Russia was building up its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow&#39;s increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the country would not fall into international isolation.
The rebels advocate the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
An international coalition led by the United States is subjecting IS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander against Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, Alexander Boroday, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He stated this in a telephone interview with a Lenta.ru correspondent.
The article in the Washington Post is beautiful in that it is completely distorted.
Naturally, no one tied up former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov and he “left” the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high spirits, without ropes, without three trucks of money that are attributed to him by different characters,&quot; he said.
According to Borodai, there was indeed talk of Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter from an American newspaper.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication decided to write that Strelkov was taken to Russia &quot;bound&quot;.
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then these are surprisingly misunderstood words, since I emphasized that Strelkov left on his own,” Borodai said.
&quot;This is a slander both on me and on Strelkov,&quot; he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which cited Borodai&#39;s words that he took Strelkov to Russia forcibly.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie up his colleague.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish lumberjacks have begun cutting down trees above an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with gold from the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the veracity of the rumors about the train with the treasure.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, Tomasz Smolarz, Governor of Poland&#39;s Lower Silesian Voivodeship, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland&#39;s deputy minister of culture, Piotr Zuchowski, said that local treasure hunters had &quot;with a 99 percent probability&quot; found the very train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is spoken of in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm turned to the authorities in the Polish city of Walbrzych with a message that they had found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to 21 years.
Yevgeny Bryun noted that before this age, &quot;any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is especially detrimental.&quot;
So he said live on the radio station &quot;Moscow speaking&quot;, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years old.
A person matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
&quot;It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21,&quot; Brune said.
Earlier, Sultan Khamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the Sober Russia project, told Izvestiya that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and &quot;agreed to raise this issue again at the site of the upper house of parliament, together with the Public Chamber.&quot;
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill led by Matviyenko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A Novosibirsk resident turned to the regional prosecutor&#39;s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law &quot;On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development,&quot; a Sib.fm correspondent read the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the Chitay-Gorod store on Krasny Prospekt.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law &quot;On the protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development.&quot;
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor&#39;s office of the city of Novosibirsk.
A response to an appeal from a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to the correspondent of Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very fundamental problem that will stir up society.
It will also begin to reread the Bible, which it did not do before.
Rio Grande Brazilian Union of Pediatricians promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for good nutrition while breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of babies suckling breasts painted with images of junk food.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, from which babies get all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant women and women who have given birth, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research shows that a single calorie increase is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that eating healthy during pregnancy actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy eating on the child&#39;s immune system has been identified.
Near Hamburg, a train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus, which got stuck on the railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of their eyes.
It was captured on video by one of the students.
Due to the emergency, there was panic among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the roadside.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, miraculously no one was hurt, except for one passenger on the train, who received minor injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali&#39;s victory by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown also ended up in the hospital with a head injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support machine.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and ended one fight in a draw.
He left two children.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to practice this sport, but it is better, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, - said the vice-president of the organization Stephen Parnis. -
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He stated this while speaking at a session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Ulaanbaatar.
We assess this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
&quot;And this should not be repeated, because this is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of an open international dialogue,&quot; the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let&#39;s bring morality back to politics.
Let&#39;s bring dialogue and law back into the practice of international communication.
Let&#39;s return humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
&quot;Duplicity never ends well,&quot; he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to concentrate on the following specific tasks in ensuring security.
&quot;Firstly, on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,&quot; Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be given credit.
&quot;This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,&quot; the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul, Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the European team championship at his crowning distance of 110 meters with hurdles, set several records, and most importantly - become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic hurdles sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the &quot;Diamond League&quot;, taking third place in the overall standings.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I&#39;m going to perform at the Military World Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I&#39;ll think about rest.
True, I will now prepare at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still a completely different state.
Everything is easier than traveling around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
End of August, beginning of September is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season have boiled away, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, in &quot;relaxation&quot;.
Plus, you know that the holidays are coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue at the end of the season always accumulates.
And here it doesn’t matter what he did more - won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moving - all this does not pass without a trace for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now my emotions are on the rise, of course.
What is there - I&#39;m just happy!
By the time you finished at the World Championships in Beijing, do you return often?
Happens.
And you, journalists, do not let me forget about it.
But in general, I think that the athlete who lives on old victories, scrolls through his successful races again and again, is bad.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we must move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can&#39;t say there was anything special.
We started preparing back in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
I trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
Everything is as usual.
But with the coach we set the task: to try to reach a new level, at which I have not yet been.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did general physical training exercises, which included both traction and squatting, and we pumped our back.
Then we started hurdle training, did a lot of technical work.
Did you follow the performance of the opponents?
I always try to do this, fortunately in the era of the Internet there are no problems with this.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there the French took the entire pedestal in the hurdle sprint!
I also thought: something needs to be done, to dilute this company.
With each start this season, you added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
For me, all the last seasons are formed according to approximately the same pattern.
There is no such thing that I run first 13.20, and then - 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for exploits, but at competitions it is not always possible to show your readiness.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - &quot;NO&quot;) right away.
I was ready very well, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if I had repeated my best result at that time, I would have become the bronze medalist of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
But how?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get into the final then, there was such a maximum program.
And he fell off right from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and rushing headlong means not running anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he already reached the final with the best time.
I well remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold even then!
How do you manage, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to switch off?
And this is the most difficult part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technique, so as not to bring down the barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it&#39;s much easier.
And the most thrill is when you get the feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out by itself!
Honestly, it&#39;s worth it.
Many of our athletes from the outback, after the first serious successes, tend to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Home is still better.
Yes, and I can’t imagine where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov for a long time?
From the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
More precisely, at first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she passed me on.
I started with a sprint, then a long jump, a triple.
There was a children&#39;s all-around - this is when they throw the ball, long jump from a place ...
At 14 I tried hurdling and I liked it.
From the very first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
And so it remained.
Have you ever had a fear of barriers?
Somehow I managed to reach an agreement with them.
But technology has always had a lot of work to do.
Look at one overclocking how much he suffered!
But there is no escape from this routine.
The technique must be perfected constantly - so that at night I could be woken up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing says that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don&#39;t usually review my runs, but this time I couldn&#39;t resist.
But efficiency needs further work - there are no limits to perfection.
Are you not afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on your shoulders with a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, then you must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not a weakling, you should not feel any additional load.
And I absolutely agree with him on this.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I&#39;m not so naive that I was astonished by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don&#39;t feed them bread - give them, throw up the enemy.
And although I didn’t wrap myself in a flag, and I said the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times here, and I didn’t call anyone a bastard directly, something else hurt me.
All my pseudo-friends disappeared in an instant, in a second.
The pressure I&#39;m under is so strong that even I, a battered boy, think that the people of henbane have overate.
It was as if you were walking, walking, and a crowd attacked you and beat you with rods.
But you need to know me, I&#39;m not a house eagle, I&#39;m a fist, I&#39;ll hit a howitzer, I&#39;m old, guys, be afraid.
Another thing - no support.
I had no illusions anyway, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
And only idiots can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
It would be better for me, the best journalist, a shameless job.
A week ago in Kyiv, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how tipsy Khrushchev tried to sign something does not at all fit into the general picture of human society.
It&#39;s like going to a neighbor and taking away his living space...
The war started from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it began with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin&#39;s dungeon.
I have a guess who it could be...
Kobzon does not have much to live left.
I don&#39;t understand, he is the greatest artist, why does he need to lick Putin&#39;s hands.
Is he losing his apartment?
Well, they took down his statue.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland.
And now reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise Leads the Rankings Despite Nine&#39;s Attempts to Highlight Losing Leaders on Today Show
The outing of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party&#39;s announcement to vacate the leader&#39;s seat failed to lift Today&#39;s ratings much.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull&#39;s rout of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London for a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture of distance didn&#39;t seem to matter much to Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 in the five biggest cities, compared to Today&#39;s audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its rankings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been bridging the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise&#39;s 330,000.
At the start of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, folks!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the hit show on his own, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a resounding yes.
The X Factor remained strong on 7th with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven, luck and bad luck were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00 pm to 5:30 pm) of the new game show hosted by Andrew O&#39;Keefe attracted 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 pm to 6:00 pm) saw the figure jump to 623,000 spectators, enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers and the second half hour an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia&#39;s ratings on the second night will force Nine to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire&#39;s show.

The three finalists are unanimous that &quot;The Bachelor&quot; Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snejana Markoski may have accidentally hinted at who will win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And the three girls who have reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two out of three girls would be left, they may have inadvertently given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood steadfastly remains silent until the very final, which will take place on Thursday
All three women are in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question &quot;If not you, then who should get Wood&#39;s last rose?&quot; they could unwittingly suggest which of them actually won the heart of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;.
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski have no doubt called McKay the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam developed a good relationship from day one.
&quot;From the moment I joined the cast, I felt [Sarah&#39;s] energy and Sam&#39;s energy and realized that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubts about it,&quot; said Jevons-Fellows.
&quot;Sarah is a very open person, it&#39;s easy and fun to be with her,&quot; Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be &quot;the same person.&quot;
&quot;As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart,&quot; she says.
When asked who Voodoo should choose if it wasn&#39;t her, she answered cryptically.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can talk about it,&quot; she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snezhana and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show airs on Wednesdays at 7:30 pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the US - as were a host of other clubs who sent in requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomsul, and it looks like it was a wise decision.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench for the remainder of the game for a ball loss the former Australian rugby league player made on the first punt return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the punt, and also brought him into the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula proved to be a good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of blasting the rookies in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who told him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on a punt return by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count on such an early debut in the NHL.
Hayne was seen cursing as he walked off the field after losing the ball, and later told hosts of the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1&#39;s Hamish &amp; Andy that he couldn&#39;t have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
&quot;Things happen, you just think about the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a shot in his own end zone gave Queensland a try.
Ultimately, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

On the border of Hungary there were clashes between migrants and the police.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian village of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at police officers and try to tear down a fence set up at the border.
Reinforcements have been sent to the scene of the clashes, the police are taking action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.

The country&#39;s authorities allowed migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, as well as an accelerated procedure for considering asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the issue of transferring the functions of guarding the border to the armed forces of Hungary, the parliament of the country.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.

The latter denies his guilt in the crimes incriminated to him.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of Russian support for Bashar al-Assad&#39;s regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia&#39;s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
&quot;Secretary Kerry signaled that Russia&#39;s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict and undermining our shared goal of fighting extremism unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition,&quot; the statement said. published on the website of the US Department of State.
Kerry reaffirmed the US commitment to fight the Islamic State group (which has been banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.

Four die when police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets into crowds protesting the country&#39;s proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country&#39;s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing rocks and firebombs.
Mr Dakal said the police fired tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in the southern lowlands of Nepal, where the Madesi say the new provinces under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among Tharu citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which had been centrally ruled for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers hastened the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on the articles of the Kathmandu draft constitution this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed into law by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry; it has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of &quot;Regional&quot; about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valerievich, how did you get started as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the spending of local budget funds.
Then an audit of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the paperwork to five days.
Previously, papers could go through the authorities for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and optimize costs.
Last November, Sayansk hosted an off-site meeting of the government, where issues of the socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no design estimate documentation (DED) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of design and estimate documentation for roads, a kindergarten, a northern sewer and a water conduit.
Currently, road works are already underway in two sections.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of availability of places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
Since September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 places, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Kindergarten No. 23 was opened last year after repairs, and now 200 children attend it.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People&#39;s Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the queue of children aged from one and a half to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is being put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will start soon.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters. m of housing There are a lot of people wishing to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes turnkey finishing.
If we cope with the given volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we also have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayansky pig farm was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor&#39;s office to challenge this transaction.
Moreover, the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality, is being resolved.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig farm, we will have 900 jobs, which will be of great help to the city.
Is the institution of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC &quot;Vostok-Center&quot;, Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, LLC &quot;Sayan Broiler&quot;, LLC &quot;PK MDF&quot;, the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly on the Day of the City, LLC &quot;Sayansky Broiler&quot; presented the city with a children&#39;s town, the company &quot;Vostok-Center&quot; repaired the horse yard, where specialists deal with children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on this.
Thanks to sponsorship, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade took place with the participation of city teams and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded commemorative medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800,000 rubles have been allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and subject teachers.
To solve the personnel issue, the provision of housing for specialists is of great importance.
Over the past year, we allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers received office housing.
We have a program to allocate housing with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans include redevelopment of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also teachers and doctors participate in the program &quot;Housing for the Russian family&quot;.
In the future - the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has a workable team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A draft law on the indexation of social pensions, taking into account price increases, has been submitted to the Duma.

The draft law, submitted to the lower chamber, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva stated that sanctions against lawmakers participating in assembly events are unacceptable.

Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA acted with the intention to collect signatures of deputies, who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the EU&#39;s governing structures and &quot;send a corresponding petition.&quot;
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined area of low pressure, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, forecasters from Miami said.
Google Launches Doubling Campaign to Raise $11M for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a doubling campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach when it announced the fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
&quot;We traveled on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,&quot; she wrote.
I&#39;m lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations dedicated to helping refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount at google.com/refugeerelief reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, sparked in large part by a four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with slight obesity may benefit from obesity surgery
The beneficial effects after obesity surgery in slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that slightly obese diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
&quot;The death statistics don&#39;t show up right away,&quot; said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery expert who wrote about the new study in an editorial column for JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but the main studies have been in people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan&#39;s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially cured.
In the drug-treated group, by comparison, complete cure of diabetes was seen in only 1% and partial cure in only about 2%.
In addition, measures of blood pressure, triglycerides, and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol &quot;were generally better in the surgical group,&quot; the authors state.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, mean hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But better glycemic control performance, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce the death rate in five years, according to research leader Dr Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the mean results of the two types of surgical treatment.
At year 5, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3. 1% versus 2.1%) and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a life expectancy benefit from surgery beyond five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery does increase life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the Phoenix College of Medicine. University of Arizona.
Obese people who opted for bariatric intervention were about 29% less likely to die within 15 years, compared with more traditional methods, according to a Swedish study.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this is encouraging people with a BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
&quot;Here, the report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in the low BMI group, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,&quot; she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient&#39;s BMI falls between 27 and 30.
&quot;I think we&#39;re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,&quot; she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse this.
In Mytishchi, robbers took fur coats and 9 million rubles out of the house.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked residents of a house near Moscow and stole 9 million rubles and three women&#39;s fur coats from them.
This is reported by &quot;Interfax&quot; with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified men entered the house located on Gorky Street through the open front door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article &quot;robbery&quot;.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to watch the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
Interlocutors of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, you will have to overpay for rented housing.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must go through a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the OFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly officials.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the townspeople by placing this or that number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now literally every number counts, not a single one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels during the football championship.
Now tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to Nana Gvichia, First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have passed the classification at the moment - so many checks have been carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, by an amazing coincidence, is unknown.
That is, there may be more people who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
“Over the past six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification,” admitted Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-Western Branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets that did not include the cost of inspections, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still, hotel managers have recently become more active and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels must be in time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star rating, a fixed fee for a hotel room will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas by which the cost will be calculated will be made public next year.
This was done in order to prevent prices from skyrocketing by 200-300%, as happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow a two or three times increase, but hotels also need to be allowed to earn.
&quot;I think the growth will be up to 50%&quot;, - explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of a market economy.
I do not know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
&quot;It&#39;s better than a rampant rise in prices,&quot; he said.
It is not clear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill according to which hostels should be prohibited in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
&quot;We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved,&quot; Nana Gvachia believes.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then about 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will close, and at the moment they have 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West, Leonid Garbar, there are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is analogous to the situation when &quot;75 thousand VIPs sit in an 80,000-seat stadium.&quot;
This can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban &quot;idiocy&quot;: &quot;It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors cannot.&quot;
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it&#39;s like a hotel where guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup and because of their sluggishness.
As many as hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and they dig a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order work.
“There are not so many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive,” Gennady Lamshin noted, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of passed inspections are currently significantly higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected, among other things, with the constant reshuffles in the government&#39;s tourism bloc, which does not contribute to well-coordinated work.
According to experts, if there are not enough St. Petersburg hotels for everyone, then most likely it will be necessary to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized to the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive preparedly in vans in which it will be possible to spend the night.
&quot;The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they would be empty later,&quot; Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also, rented accommodation will be very popular during the football championship.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
“From the obvious, the housing near the stadium will be the first to leave,” said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to its previous level after the championship, especially in residential areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the townspeople.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only give directions, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in the yard in 1970 - father, mother and two children.
It turned out that they had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult then with hotels, it was hard to sleep at the station.
“And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that now there is no such trait left in the inhabitants of the city - calling to your home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky &quot;leaked&quot; the Amur Region.
With admiration today I looked at Zhirinovsky&#39;s clowning in the State Duma.
He did things like this when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and he&#39;s still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is &quot;the protest of the Liberal Democratic Party against the election results in the Amur Region.&quot;
Protocols do not shake - because there is nothing; other protocols, except for those signed by the election commissions, the Liberal Democratic Party, apparently, no.
Here he lifts Ivan Abramov, who took second place, and shouts something like: &quot;Here is the winner of the elections!&quot;
And then, out of nowhere, he pounces on Rodnina, and then, after a skirmish with the presiding officer, he leads the faction out of the meeting room, yelling literally &quot;You are all crooks and thieves with your fronts.&quot;
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur Region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of &quot;Scum!&quot;, and not at all a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the website of the party and Ivan Abramov&#39;s Facebook, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
He leaves the dead on the Amur to bury their dead themselves, while he himself preaches the gospel against United Russia as a whole and against the innocent Rodnina.
An elegant solution, so as not to lose face, and not to go into a real, and not ostentatious, scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
In addition to screams from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on hand.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for a narrow circle, it was he who became the formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks against the EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think very much about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, politician number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a pariah, who was successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-irritant for that same ONF and someone else&#39;s party leadership.
That&#39;s for sure - if there were no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully observed.
Trump has yet to grow and grow before him.
There was news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is, the bath fell from nothing at all.
The only thing is that Abramov buried the topic under her.
Beautiful indeed.
&#39;It&#39;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe&#39; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the inauguration of the Dalai Lama&#39;s Compassion Center for Ethics Studies in Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that under the existing circumstances, the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
&quot;It&#39;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
&quot;Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,&quot; he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,&quot; he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the harsh US response set off a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this caused unexpected consequences,&quot; the Dalai Lama said.
Quadruple increase in the number of children who swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Poison centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have ingested high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia State Poison Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Poison Control Center, cases of ingestion of hand sanitizers reported to poison control centers by children under 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Children come into contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to bet on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as cheap booze.
The teens reportedly mixed the disinfectant with an alcohol-based mouthwash to create a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of the disinfectant liquid.
&quot;The kid doesn&#39;t think it can hurt him,&quot; Lopez said.
Many of the most addictive (hand sanitizers) are those that are scented.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
&quot;It&#39;s a high-strength alcohol,&quot; Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn&#39;t just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in plain sight, and if the kids get to them, it&#39;s a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested about four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, was admitted to the ER for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, the emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta. .
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her overnight at a separate children&#39;s clinic for any signs of a brain injury, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchie said.
&quot;It was very scary,&quot; Orthoria Scott, Naiji&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could well have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic agents or disinfectant wipes, in addition to keeping hand sanitizers out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a disinfectant containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, the lethal agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their &quot;obnoxious&quot; teacher by &quot;distributing antibacterial substances in the classroom,&quot; according to a police report.
The teacher is severely allergic to hand sanitizers and has banned them from her classroom.
The police believe the failed plan was &quot;blank talk&quot; and are raising discipline issues with the school district.
How the oldest children&#39;s library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children&#39;s library. N.K. Krupskaya is sad cast-iron owl.
Toddlers who come for books try to feed her with sweets.
For several generations, this library has been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, put on performances based on Mayakovsky&#39;s poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin&#39;s wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper &quot;Young Stalinets&quot; wrote in 1939, every day &quot;the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children&#39;s library of the city of Barnaul&quot; became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photograph to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the people of Barnaul asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being named after her, she wrote that no, she did not mind.
Letters have been collecting dust in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose stern profile is adorned with a bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, were indignant: why is the children&#39;s library not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children&#39;s writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
&quot;Krupskaya&quot; is, perhaps, the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, like &quot;leninka&quot; in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick walkway.
&quot;The Wizard of the Emerald City&quot; is the favorite theme of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, she came to work at eight, left at five, and differed from all other managers only in her love for drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: &quot;An illustrator for a book is required.&quot;
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called &quot;My Cancer Mommy&quot; - &quot;My mom has cancer.&quot;
Olya made illustrations and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don’t create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children&#39;s books by writers from all over the world and composes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space...
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - Tatyana Kushvid, director of the library, tells Russian Planet.
In recent years, we even had such a moment of confidence that a children&#39;s library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
It seems to me that interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition stained-glass window with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library rejoices that fathers are increasingly coming with their children.
If at the age of two the child was read all of Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs more complicated books.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old child prodigy from issuing books from the 12+ category.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then come back again, and gradually &quot;Krupskaya&quot; becomes for them something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yats and epics, Korolenko&#39;s stories in the supplement to the Niva magazine, the Murzilka file for 1936.
After all, we are now not only a conceptual space &quot;the temple of the book&quot;, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - Tatyana Kushvid explains.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a play area for kids - a child just comes to play, but the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, but they rest on their legs, do not want to leave.
Mothers often come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all other places where you need to come with your kids.
Tatyana Kushvid says: today&#39;s children, just like we once loved classic children&#39;s literature:
&quot;The publishing industry is now developing, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations.&quot;
And if we talk about little children, then it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, which tells what is happening in modern children&#39;s literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
Adults are not allowed to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase leading to the basement, to the book depository.
The steps will creak under your steps - this is already a very old time machine.
You meet with the book of your childhood as with an old comrade: hello, it’s good that we don’t change.
Ellie still walks cheerfully along the road paved with yellow bricks, the lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - he has such a firm word.
Such books are like passwords, you can use them to find your own anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yats and eras.
Or Korolenko&#39;s story in the famous supplement to the Niva magazine.
Or the Murzilka file for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I keep dreaming - I will retire and take care of rare children&#39;s books.
But children won&#39;t fall for it, so to speak: the colors in old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write out this &quot;Pioneer Truth?&quot;
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository, tells the Russian Planet.
The pages of &quot;Murzilka&quot; have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilievna has been in charge of the book depository all her life.
She knows what color Pinocchio&#39;s cap is, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and who Alisa Selezneva&#39;s father works for.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and anyone who can live without these rows of books very quickly finds himself another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by their smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children&#39;s librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation - this is a professional.
In general, I love children&#39;s books: as a librarian, I like them to be there, to stand evenly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical novels, fairy tales, science fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, it seems to me that in my childhood everything was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me then.
And because I was madly in love with them, it seemed to me that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren ...
Rumor mill: There is no controversy at Celtic
Griffiths has dismissed rumors of disagreements at Celtic after Deila admitted the Hoops were in a bad spot, but he will fix that.
Hearts will protest Scottish Football Association&#39;s claim against Neilson, as Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could break team unity
&quot;Dons&quot; increased the advantage over the &quot;Celtic&quot; to five points
Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a slight lead over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denied talk of controversy
This set off rumors of a disagreement at Celtic, which were quelled by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism as they prepared to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don&#39;t think that we feel the tension, I think that the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as he is not in contention with Rangers.
De Boer, now a spokesman for Ajax, said: &quot;They don&#39;t show the best moments of Celtic games anymore in Holland, why?&quot;
It&#39;s because there are no Rangers.
People here are talking about more than just a Rangers comeback.
They talk about the &quot;Old Firm&quot;.
They talk about both teams together and that&#39;s what interests them.
There&#39;s a lot of tension in &quot;Old Firm&quot; games, and it&#39;s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
&quot;I&#39;ll change everything,&quot; said Deyla
Ronnie Deyla has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to turn things around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting Champions League exit was soon followed by a loss to 10 players from Aberdeen, who are now five points clear at the top of the table.
However, Deyla said: &quot;Selitka have had bad spells before and we will come out again.&quot;
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and quite a few people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic&#39;s support because it makes the players so much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton looks forward to January transfers with disbelief
Despite opinions that surfaced just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he had identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is skeptical of the January campaign, saying he doesn&#39;t want to destroy the team&#39;s unity.
The former Brentford striker said: &quot;The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.&quot;
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for them to adapt, which is what you saw in our own group this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at his retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who has been linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may leave football once his contract with the Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and has been unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to confront SFA over Neilson claims
The Hearts were 2-1 up when they sent off Paterson and went 3-2 down, but the defender&#39;s red card was later cancelled; this is Collum&#39;s third red card canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not retract his words, stating: &quot;I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game.&quot;
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle
The hard-nosed Hibernian player has been reprimanded after admitting he sang a song with offensive words about former Hearts player Rudy Skazel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
&quot;It was a derby and it was in the heat of the moment,&quot; the striker said, adding: &quot;I can safely say that I had no intention of returning to Tynecastle if he wasn&#39;t playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis board confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly says Dundee United&#39;s board remains confident that the management team will turn things around, but agrees that the deterioration on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We&#39;ll get the guys ready to go out again,&quot; Donnelly said.
McInnes happy for &#39;ugly&#39; win against Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to battle desperately against Hamilton Assis to secure their seventh straight league win, putting them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the standings thanks to Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty .
McInness said: &quot;There is no team here that has won something - a cup, or a league championship, who has not won matches in this way.&quot;
The unemployment rate among the Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, was higher than the UK&#39;s rate of 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employees now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: &quot;The government&#39;s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.&quot;
Almost exactly one year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labor market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a man being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll be sitting on the death row viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made back in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more applicants than places, the results of a grim lottery decide who gets selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can not do it.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends, and we developed a relationship of our own after several months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I&#39;ll have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner&#39;s story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she &quot;could have put it better&quot; herself, but she still thinks I&#39;m wrong in what I&#39;m doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn&#39;t tell me what to write, and I wouldn&#39;t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes publicity will help the abolition movement.
Kim Bellver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I won&#39;t go into details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese makes him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of the murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence for a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is erroneous.
And from this angle, I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
From me you will know what it&#39;s like to watch the person I like die unnecessarily.
Man pursued by police persuaded to climb out of Canning River
A constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry himself.
The Perth man intended to evade the police, but failed, getting stuck in muddy shallow water a few meters away from a police officer who was trying to &quot;gently coax him out of the water&quot;.
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for trespassing in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn&#39;t get far.
&quot;He stood in the water and said, &#39;I&#39;m not going out, come on, grab me,&#39;&quot; Staff Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
PC Lachlan Perhavets didn&#39;t really want to get his uniform wet, so he used the safer technique of &quot;negotiating with a good cop.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes people do strange things to try and escape,&quot; Staff Sergeant Castledine says.
Football champion Ben Cousins is exactly what he remembers.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a police patrol for an alcohol test and attempted to swim across the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but inspired the locals to invent the comic &quot;Ben Cousins biathlon&quot;.
Peter Moody accuses stewards of trying to spy and threatens to quit equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to plant a spy in his stable last year and threatened to quit horse riding immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and Racing Victoria ethics officials, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and Lady Tatai&#39;s removal from the start due to a violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always does his best when racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidari&#39;s positive cobalt result, which he cannot explain.
He held his tongue about the suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to &quot;look like green grapes.&quot;
“I was not going to say anything about it, and endured for a long time, but sometimes it unsettles you so much that you no longer hold back,” Moody said.
They know it&#39;s been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep soundly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I do my best for them.
When they start to think that this is not so, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I&#39;ll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
&quot;A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I will name if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to relay information about what I do in my stable,&quot; stated Moody on Racing.com.
They clearly think I&#39;m a scammer.
If that&#39;s the case, they should certainly all apply, since they failed in their attempt to capture me.
Robert Rolston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, our current RVL chief executive, have known this all along and know it now.
Shouldn&#39;t this make me think the matter is getting personal?
Shouldn&#39;t RVL have the courage to hold other people besides the coaches accountable for what&#39;s going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I really bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that&#39;s the way it is.
Maybe they should take my license away and kick me out, and I have no doubt that what I&#39;m saying now might make them think about it.
But now I&#39;ve reached the point where I don&#39;t care, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them responsible for the decision.
I have family support and I can leave.
The coach&#39;s annoyance only grew over the course of the long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the latest withdrawal of the horse from the start led him to declare that he could &quot;throw his license on the table.&quot;
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Kaviar, called the requirement for medication on race day &quot;ridiculous&quot; after a clay compress was applied to the horse&#39;s legs in violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules at the races.
&quot;I have to take full responsibility for this,&quot; he said.
One of my employees put a compress on her leg by mistake.
She could have received a compress last night.
She could have received it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody is subject to a three-month suspension under competition day medication rules for using a compress, which the stewards have opened an investigation into.
This is an anecdote.
The people who make these rules don&#39;t know anything about horses.
&quot;We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
Driver who ran over and fled the scene in Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy counters allegations of heavy hitting by opponents
Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team&#39;s interception as &quot;an agenda setting&quot; from two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to &quot;fight&quot; his team during the Storm&#39;s surprise victory in the qualifier final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos manager Wayne Bennett made a clear allusion to the Storm after his team won the qualifier final against the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game &quot;typical&quot; of rugby league and said the two from the Queensland team were not &quot;too successful&quot; in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team&#39;s interception and stated that they were simply focused on &quot;contact&quot; by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team by two top coaches, as it means they are worried about a possible loss to the Storm.
&quot;It keeps coming up - I didn&#39;t hear Trent Robinson talking about the hard moves when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven&#39;t changed anything for a whole year in our systems or defensive techniques, it&#39;s just that in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contact when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he&#39;s obviously coaching a great team, so he&#39;s probably not used to losing and it&#39;s been a bit of a shock to him.
It&#39;s funny how it always shows up this time of year.
Bellamy took issue with Bennett&#39;s idea of &quot;impressive football&quot;, reminding his teacher that Bennett&#39;s St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 playing &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was,&quot; Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 “St. George” was criticized a lot, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care.
But now he has a team that can deliver what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made the remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football the way he does - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they are somewhat worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn&#39;t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm vs. Roosters game was a higher-scoring game than the Broncos vs. Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, this is impressive football?
Or consider interruptions and failed attempts impressive?
For me, it&#39;s routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The Storm have a day off this weekend as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning .
Serb accused of drug possession released on $200,000 bail
A man facing life in prison for attempting to steal 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the yacht Solay, sailing from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen on the pier, and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for attempting to embezzle drugs in quantities sufficient to sell, Maksimovich&#39;s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the entire batch, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intention .
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,&quot; he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich&#39;s mother and stepfather were asked to post a $200,000 joint bail for his release.
&quot;From the testimony of both, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them,&quot; Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimović was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and respect the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: &quot;I&#39;m proud of the Greek team that fought until the last seconds.&quot;
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 final match of EuroBasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game, - quotes AFP Katsikaris.
We were preparing for a great game by the Spaniards.
We tried to work on the defensive, but defensive mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It&#39;s sad, but I&#39;m proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: &quot;In CSKA, I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaun.&quot;
Newcomer CSKA Joel Freeland said he did not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, Freeland is quoted by R-Sport. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive formations and in attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yes, it will take me some time to rebuild to the center position, after all, in the NBA I played more forward.
Now it will be necessary to resist the opponent&#39;s big centers more, but I have already done this before, so I think I can handle it now.
The army team last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but each time they could not show their best basketball.
There is an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
That&#39;s the whole game, you can&#39;t win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, anything is possible.
I don&#39;t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: &quot;For me, the match against Roma will be special.&quot;
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique did not hide the fact that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage against Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the full-time duel between his current and former teams will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the Wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show his best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - leads the official website of UEFA the words of Luis Enrique. -
I have exceptionally fond memories of Rome.
For me it will be a special game, but it&#39;s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect Roma to play like they did in Serie A against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking actions.
On the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar, the acting head coach of the Urals, Vadim Skripchenko, noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opposing team.
According to the mentor, the “bulls” have in their arsenal several models of the game in attack.
The fight will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
We&#39;ll see how we play with Krasnodar, - Skripchenko&#39;s official website quotes the Urals website.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking actions, carries out its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time, we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
On the eve of this game, given that Krasnodar is playing a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well in order to win.
Roger Kanas: &quot;Astana can take points from anyone at home&quot;
Midfielder &quot;Astana&quot; Roger Kanas after the match of the 1st round of the group stage of the Champions League with &quot;Benfica&quot; (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team&#39;s game in the future.
According to the midfielder, in his field, Astana residents are able to take points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA the words of Cañas. - We lacked a bit of courage in the attack.
Benfica are superior, but at home I think we can expect to take points away from them.
It&#39;s quite real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atlético.
In home matches, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: &quot;I&#39;ll repeat it as many times as I like: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.&quot;
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed his satisfaction with a major victory in the Champions League group stage match against Shakhtar (4:0) in the first round match.
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar know how to handle the ball, - Benitez quotes the official UEFA website as saying.
The opponent did not have many chances, but their counterattacks are always fraught with danger.
I won&#39;t say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I am pleased that we did not concede goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
This is the best player in the world, I will repeat this as many times as I like.
Jordi Alba: &#39;Cristiano Ronaldo can&#39;t compare to Messi&#39;
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one can compare with his teammate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo can&#39;t do that either.
Messi is five goals higher than the rest, - Le Figaro quotes Alba. - What Leo can do, no one can.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field everything changes, I can&#39;t compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona have not only a unique style, but also strong personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the Champions League group stage match with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and safety net in a game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let&#39;s remind, &quot;SE&quot; will carry out its text translation.
&quot;Barcelona&quot; is a special opponent, a good team with great players, - quotes the official website of UEFA De Rossi. -
Blue garnets are difficult to play with, as they not only have a unique style, but also strong personalities.
To keep them, we will have to plow throughout the match and secure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he dribbles, so we need to stay compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to start in SKA against Slovan.
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the army team in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov took to the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with the score 0:3 and saved all the shots on his own goal, conceding the fourth goal of SKA after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth outfield player.
The team will play the next match on the road against Slovan.
I hope that I will go out in the next match in the starting lineup, - R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
I&#39;m not an expert on goalkeepers, I&#39;m a goalkeeper myself, we don&#39;t show replays of goals conceded, so it&#39;s hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Recall also that on Monday Shafarzhova rose one line in the WTA rankings and is now the fifth racket of the world.
Steven Hogg used girl&#39;s phone to force pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to solicit images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping, registered on an Internet messaging service, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the phone was missing and found it in Hogg&#39;s sleeping hand.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately brought it to the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at that address and found &quot;relevant&quot; queries in a search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the cops that he did it because it would &quot;attract paedophiles&quot; and then he would &quot;pretend he&#39;s a cop to scare them&quot;.
Commissioner Eilid Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff&#39;s Court: &quot;He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he made the requests on the computer, but stated that this was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about talking to an unknown person who sent him images and asking for more photos.
He said he did it to lure them in.
He said he had problems with his head when he drank and stated that he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
Ms Robertson added: &quot;When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then a confrontation was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaking bail on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant&#39;s attorney Gregor Sim filed a motion not to list Hogg as a sex offender because it can be shown that there was no &quot;significant sexual element&quot; to the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred the sentence until October, pending receipt of information from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody pending hearings in other remaining cases.
He was included in the list of persons who committed sexual offenses even before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s oldest state leader, fell off the podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but a video of the fall scene went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by claims by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe during the address.
A month ago they booed the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that was the speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change MP Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled &#39;Death,&#39;&quot; he told reporters after Mugabe&#39;s speech ended.
It warned the noted members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was &quot;worried&quot; about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its service restructuring and cost reduction program.
This year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the computer and printer business from the faster-growing hardware and services sectors.
Estimated job losses will cost approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
&quot;This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently has, with a broader and deeper portfolio of business lines that will help the company transition to a new business style,&quot; Whitman said.
As an individual company, we are better placed than ever to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will generate more than $50 billion in annual revenue and &quot;will be focused on delivering previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions&quot; to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment is divided; their Palo Alto garage has been dubbed &quot;the birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;
Hewlett Packard is in the midst of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world&#39;s second largest personal computer maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that niche companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb game
In a conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also emphasized that it was still only September and that as long as Wilshere&#39;s recovery went according to plan, there was nothing to stop him from returning to the game by Christmas.
In the best possible scenario, Wilshere will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in doubt.
The most annoying thing about this recent issue is that Wilshere ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during preseason.
Wenger: &quot;This injury does not threaten his career.&quot;
It&#39;s just not fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It&#39;s just an accident.
It has nothing to do with the ankles or the injuries he&#39;s had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to play mid-season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has suffered 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has only played in 65 of Arsenal&#39;s 157 league games over the past five seasons.
Looking at the bigger picture for Arsenal, in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most days out due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of being stuck in a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
&quot;Sometimes when you get back into action after an injury, you&#39;re vulnerable for a while - during which time you need to recuperate and gain a competitive edge,&quot; Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I&#39;m sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal kick off the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and continue with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, with Wenger set to rotate squads.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will most likely be in the starting lineup.
Perhaps Wenger will also bring in Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep the balance and give a little bit of a break to the players who need it,&quot; Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites in Group F, Zagreb&#39;s Maksimir Stadium is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost a single out of 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson they learned last season when they were defeated in the Champions League by Monaco and remains with a faint hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
&quot;It&#39;s an incredible drive,&quot; Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Show That Taught Us Some Serious Lessons in Male Friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate men&#39;s need for candor has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and occurs three times more often in men than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Misery declared 2015 the Year of Men in an effort to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a sufficiently large number of friends &quot;in a normal mood&quot;, the chances of a cure doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental illness.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an age where communication is driven by social media, where style is preferred to content, quick response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life redoubles the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire video game creator recently pointed out, money doesn&#39;t actually buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not through their work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey&#39;s humor and Chandler&#39;s constant hugging, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross&#39;s groaning over Rachel all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, &quot;...my role as a listener for people who are feeling depressed and suicidal highlights how even the smallest of friendships can be beneficial.&quot;
Often those men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old &#39;live with it&#39; admonishment is powerful, as is the feeling that speaking frankly about problems can be seen as a weakness.&quot;
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer lasting coping mechanisms.
It emphasized the subtle moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you&#39;re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say &quot;Hi&quot;.
There is no way to predict in advance what benefits friendship can bring.
Friends is shown on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, under the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores as PSG thrash Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored against Malmö.
Angel di Maria, on his Champions League debut, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily overtake Malmö on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League game with a handy 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the course for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally extending their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Pari needed to get off to a good start against the Swedish champions as they aimed not to qualify for the play-offs but to continue their run of successful games over the past three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They scored points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on Laurent Blanc&#39;s part to deem Zlatan Ibrahimovic offensively useless and later replace him on the pitch against his hometown team and the club where he started his illustrious career in 1999 .
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, give opponents problems and play great defense is a good start, even if there are still things that we will need to work on over the course of season,&quot; Blanc said.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we didn&#39;t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from an injury in a substitution for the Paris team in a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in League One over the weekend, but he was sidelined by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been hailed as a player capable of taking Paris Saint-Germain to the next level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran on a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö&#39;s defence. and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Willand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from PSG at that time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to make it to this stage with nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a formidable opponent.
But, with the exception of a Nikola Djurdjic shot that sent the ball past the far post of Kevin Trapp&#39;s goal in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
But PSG let themselves down at times with ineffective passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only failed to convert at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process the ball scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of play.
However, he proved to be much more proficient with accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria sent the ball with a spinning shot that went right past Wieland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic corrected a ball sent into the center from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had of returning to the game, and only a close-range interception by Wieland prevented David Luiz from extending the final score before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was disqualified for a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmö manager Aghe Hareide later acknowledged that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian revealing: &quot;Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year.&quot;
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory to Pari!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion from share sales
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by declining commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion selling shares as part of its grandiose debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in commodity prices as China&#39;s economic downturn hurts demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a discount price, Glencore&#39;s share price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which traded 0.69 percent higher at the open.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of sweeping plans to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 cents a share, a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday&#39;s closing price.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company&#39;s authorized capital.
Worries about a continued downturn in the Chinese economy have slashed the price of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit - Xi Qinping&#39;s first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama&#39;s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner that evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
&quot;President Xi Jinping&#39;s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the US and Chinese presidents to constructively approach controversial topics,&quot; the report said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading US technology companies on his way to Washington, and then travel to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington&#39;s concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and China&#39;s growing categorical over the disputed South China Sea.

During the debate of the parties, the prosecutor asked Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years in prison and to recover from him the claims of the victims in full - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three in the morning in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
The BMW car, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the oncoming lane and knocked down a motorcyclist who was standing on the side of the road.
The man, born in 1989, died at the scene from his injuries.
Friends of the deceased on social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and drove into the oncoming lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from Sparrow Hills to the building of the Moscow Main Department of Internal Affairs on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation, following the results of the interrogation, detained the alleged culprit of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man who entered the temple was detained.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts, the police handed him over to the emergency psychiatric doctors.
Metropolitan police officers detained a resident of Moscow who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by the agency &quot;Moscow&quot;.
Andrey Galiakberov, head of the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, said that the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, at about 4 pm, on Kashirskoye Highway.
A naked man entered the church of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal actions.
A police squad arrived at the scene.
Law enforcement officers waited for the doctors from the psychiatric emergency team and handed over the man to them.
It turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
The networks of hot and cold water supply, sewerage, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, and a set of measures for fire safety and energy saving will be implemented.
Sochi will host the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus.
On September 17-18, Sochi will host the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
Vladimir Shuglya, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, who is part of the official delegation, talks about the upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will take part in the plenary session.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, legal support and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this testifies to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including those from 19 regions of Russia, took part in its work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of our developments is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar at the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen Region Vladimir Yakushev, the sides discussed the region&#39;s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today&#39;s difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms was touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house &quot;Belshina&quot; and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, since investment projects must work well and bring profit to the region.
They talked about further deliveries of passenger-cargo vehicles to OAO MAZ, the development of the service center of OAO MAZ, which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OAO TPATP.
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the trip of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of conversation was the completion of the coordination and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promises to reach a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional center.
During a meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already “breathing their last”, so a new batch of vehicles from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: the Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, OAO Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs to install new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the groundwork, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon got into an argument with African-American producer Effie Brown, stating backstage that ethnicity should not be considered.
During the Sunday edition of HBO&#39;s Project Greenlight, Brown was interrupted by the famous actor when she was trying to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the black lead character in the script chosen for the project.
&quot;Variety is appropriate when you&#39;re casting for the movie itself, not the show,&quot; Damon insisted.
A dumbfounded Brown, in disbelief, exclaimed &quot;Wow! Wow. Well, well,&quot; all the while the &quot;Martian&quot; actor was commenting live.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers to discuss the show&#39;s finalists.
&quot;I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to take,&quot; Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten up by a white pimp.
Producer Dear White People advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that &quot;we may not end up with what we want.&quot;
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video: &quot;Matt Damon&#39;s clarification of diversity to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE it hurts.&quot;
The tweet got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon&#39;s remarks appear just when competent coverage of the racial theme in the media is the hottest issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum across the country, calling on legislators and governments to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the move during the presentation of the Album of the Year contenders at the Grammy Awards.
&quot;Albums still matter,&quot; he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released an official statement in response to a question from Fox News contributor Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be seen as a hate group.
&quot;The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,&quot; the movement&#39;s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
&quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot; awards first champion
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the inaugural American Ninja Warrior winner on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants has yet been able to complete all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cinematographer Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and on time, becoming the first athlete in American Ninja Warrior history to clear the grueling Stage 4, but Caldiero completed the task a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the hard-won victory, Caldiero, who was shocked that he had won a million dollars, gave an interview to &quot;E! News&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s incredible to think about it, I&#39;ve never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year,&quot; Isaac told E! such a significant jump in their income.
And suddenly this ... I never even imagined how it happens ... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who completed the course first, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
&quot;If there is more than one finisher, the fastest one wins the prize,&quot; Weed said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changing, he still gets great satisfaction.
I don&#39;t think he feels hurt about it.
He is happy with what he did.
It has received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful person and family man.
He is a hero to his children and wife.
Jeff told me, &quot;if I was destined to lose to someone, I&#39;m glad it was Isaac.&quot;
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior will return for its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers quietly edge Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn&#39;t particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League&#39;s central division.
Claiming to be nothing more than a nuisance, the Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins in a 5-4 win at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed a chance to close a half-game gap over the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs in points behind the winners.
For the Detroiters, even if only for one night, it was the return of the F-word that eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
&quot;All winnings are fun, no matter how they come about,&quot; said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to supporting the offense as Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was the pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine appearances.
&quot;I just want to finish the year with a good record,&quot; Simon said.
Substitutes fail to throw in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Tigers designated batter Victor Martinez managed three hits and two runs, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit day since the four-hit game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
&quot;He worked well at bat,&quot; Osmus said.
He performed well in (as a batter), noticeably better in batting and retained this quality for the game.
With three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best shot back in the game.
Center wide receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double down the left field line.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks bowed to first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a swing strikeout from Simon before southpaw Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy passed Moer, the only player on the path, ahead of new designated batter Miguel Sano, who hit a two-run single to the left of right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners out and a equalizing run at second base, VerHagen managed to lead third baseman Trevor Pluff to double-play batting.
It was the 27th time for a leading major league player this season that Pluff has cleared the ball for a double play.
After Detroit added a safety run in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned an RBI double between the outfielders against Tigers closing pitcher Bruce Rondon to put the score at 5-4.
However, the right-hander eliminated Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a temporarily out-of-practice Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers picked up three runs in the first two innings against a veteran pitcher who was on the injured list until the game after being out for more than a month with lower back pain.
&quot;Definitely not the start I wanted,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but as the game progressed, I got more comfortable and was able to hit some pretty good shots in the third inning.&quot;
After the first batter made it to first base, Hughes threw a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walk with two strikeouts from right fielder JD Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made a single to the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez ended his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos hit a single for another run, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get close to third base, eliminating the threat.
The Tigers went up in the second inning with a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center batter Anthony Gose to go 3-0.
&quot;It was a massive hit,&quot; Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn&#39;t hit particularly well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose shots counted, threw in a non-scoring third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A. J. Achter.
Hughes counted three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez is out with a sprained right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez&#39;s shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez&#39;s absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and face the Twins.
Norris, who has made four starts with the Tigers since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not played since August 20 due to a sprained oblique muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game streak at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov&#39;s complaint about the book Prayer to God was submitted to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognize the book Prayer to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam as &quot;extremist material,&quot; Interfax reports citing city court chairman Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants in the process.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
&quot;Let them comment on such nonsense,&quot; he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city prosecutor&#39;s office filed an appeal against the decision of judge Natalya Perchenko to recognize the book as &quot;extremist material.&quot;
An appeal came from the prosecutor&#39;s office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor&#39;s office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, the judge made the wrong decision,&quot; Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as &quot;extremist material&quot; was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Koran were called &quot;extremist&quot; - &quot;We worship you and ask You for help&quot;, &quot;Do not call on anyone along with Allah.&quot;
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book &quot;devils and provocateurs.&quot;
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to legally prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred scriptures.
&quot;I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law according to which it is forbidden to take decisions in court that directly relate to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures,&quot; Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
The leadership of Facebook intends to fight manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network together with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve of the head of the department, Heiko Maas, said that the Ministry of Justice, together with social network specialists, is currently creating a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and delete comments that are incorrect in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications stating the reason for their removal.
Organizations whose experts collect complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also contribute to the prompt blocking of illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements about migrants and refugees was made by the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobic sentiments rose sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the migration crisis, unprecedented in its scale, that engulfed the countries of the European Union some time ago.
So, in Germany, all the points intended for accommodating refugees are already overcrowded today.
On the eve of the country&#39;s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were kept under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation zones will appear in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinsky cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot;, told about this to the m24.ru portal.
Relaxation zones will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such &quot;corners&quot; visitors to cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot;, if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green spaces will serve as a living fence that will separate recreation areas and areas allocated directly for burial sites.
Experts of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the fences at burial sites.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; spoke about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries can find out GPS coordinates and license plates of burial places.
In June of this year, the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the season.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles less than a week in winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen in price by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom picker was found in the Elninsk forests.
The elderly man turned out to be alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest more than a hundred hours without provisions.
It was possible to find the unfortunate mushroom picker thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: &quot;A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest.&quot;
Without food and water.
His relatives, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
It was possible to find the man after a helicopter joined the search operations.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for mushrooms and boletus, but did not return by evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the very next day, rescuers and caring residents from a neighboring village were raised in search of a mushroom picker - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day they were joined by a helicopter from the fire and rescue center.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Center, said: &quot;The helicopter was brought in, the man was found.&quot;
Gone very far, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He has come a long way at his age.
Miraculously survived.
The mushroom picker was taken to the Elninsk central regional hospital, unconscious, in a critical condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, the doctors have absolutely no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Elninsk Central District Hospital: &quot;The patient has been examined and treated.&quot;
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient&#39;s condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich every year comes to the Smolensk region from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that grandfather used to go picking mushrooms, but he never went far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: &quot;The forest is not far from the road, in principle, he is not a local.&quot;
Literally a few years came to visit, stay with relatives.
Well, I went for mushrooms.
Apparently, he went too far and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people regularly get lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Only in the last few days five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: you need to go into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind you so that you can go back later.
The emergency An-2 sat down on a clearing in the fraternal taiga.
An emergency An-2 landed right on the clearing in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline Yenisei made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no deaths or injuries, but the plane itself received significant damage during landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
There were three crew members on board - the commander, co-pilot and flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft was flying along the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
After the emergency landing of the An-2, the Bratsk Transport Prosecutor&#39;s Office began checking compliance with flight safety legislation.
An investigative group of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor&#39;s Office left for the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
The engines and on-board electronics failed on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt during the emergency landing.
News Economics ― Nobel Laureate: Globalization
Print The processes of globalization were supposed to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, Chief Researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions at the Higher School of Economics, 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries became more and more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
&quot;And those predictions came true to a large extent,&quot; Maskin emphasizes.
So, for example, China and India received a serious increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would close the gap between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequality, and more specifically, wage inequality.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article &quot;Why Global Markets Haven&#39;t Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies&quot; published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the NIE HSE.
Together with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases as globalization grows, reminds the NIE HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four skill levels of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for poor ones.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the skill level to compete with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if level C workers from poor countries have wages growing due to cooperation with B workers from rich countries, then D workers do not feel growth or their wages fall altogether.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It allows us to explain why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Choice, head of the Department of Mathematics, National Research University Higher School of Economics.
And like any powerful theory, I&#39;m sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: living connection of times.
Derbent, one of the most ancient cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show &quot;2000 years in two hours&quot; and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seemed to have descended from the pages of &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot;.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plane trees that grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque is several centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program &quot;Trees - Monuments of Wildlife&quot;.
The shadow of spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque will be poured fragrant tea and treated with Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, persimmon, medlar, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
From time immemorial, large samovars have been used in Derbent to give tea to numerous guests at a time.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
Keeping and breeding pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Poultry owners put up dovecotes in yards, under trees, in attics.
A breathtaking sight - a flock of white doves take off into the sky, similar to the flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters into the sea, this structure blocked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets were woven in Derbent as far back as the 5th century, and the technology of this unique craft has survived almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - carpets made of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with and without pile, with complex ornaments and fancy borders.
The development of the city began with mahals - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the mahals have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the aqueduct built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
Ancient springs have survived to this day, in which local residents still draw water today.
Many Derbent residents prefer water from proven historical fountains to ordinary tap water.
In Derbent there was one of the centers of pottery.
Irrigated and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters still make wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
During holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, on which students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship dates back several centuries.
A new trend is that more and more girls can be seen among tightrope walkers.
In the premises of the former Maiden&#39;s Bath, the Museum &quot;Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent&quot; operates today.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides, accompanied by their friends, washed here, and now anyone can see the vaulted-domed hall, hot and cold pools, bathing accessories that are a thing of the past.
Most houses in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of warming the body with steam are written in old books.

On one of the streets of the Old Town, a house has been preserved in which the Decembrist writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, life and everyday life of the townspeople.
Chaikhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade cakes are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of the tea house.
The Derbent dance ensemble &quot;Kaspiy&quot; was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning to perfection the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and the street lights are lit, the locals sit down on benches near the houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbents discuss everyday issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
A business &quot;airport game&quot; was held in Domodedovo.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
For this, models of three air harbors were mounted in Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, however, in terms of complexity, it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers at once with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport - hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedov hangar - a standard set of tasks that beginners have to solve.
Three large airports from different countries of the world fit in one hangar at once.
Today they employ four hundred students from metropolitan colleges and universities.
An unparalleled chance to learn all about the inner world of an air harbor.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - they were even entrusted with buses on the airfield, ladders and screening of passengers.
And the passengers are problematic.
One had a mess with his documents, another missed his flight, a third filled his bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the shortest possible time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are credited with a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for servicing the flight.
&quot;They are fined if they fail to fulfill their respective tasks,&quot; Dmitry Khilko, financial analyst of the game, explains in an interview with the Vesti-Moskva program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
&quot;Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will, in fact, become new models for the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, highly qualified personnel, and modern equipment,&quot; says the director of the Department of State Policy in the Field of Training Workforce and Additional Professional Education of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science Natalya Zolotareva.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But marks for this examination had quite material expression.
The latest smart glasses, the best I&#39;ve ever seen!
&quot;I received them for responding to the claim against our airport on Instagram in a timely manner,&quot; said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they say, were taken on a pencil in order to invite them to work by the time they completed their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed its regret over the closure of the American Center operating at the Library for Foreign Literature.
The Center has been operating in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the US Embassy at the All-Russian State Library. M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
&quot;The recent unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation cast doubt on the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries,&quot; said US Ambassador John Tefft, received by Interfax.
The American Center created deep and strong bonds between the people and cultures of Russia and the United States.
It served as the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place for numerous American dignitaries, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
&quot;Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors,&quot; the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX educational exchange program (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal turned out to be quick to punish.
A typical situation: four officials are standing in front of the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn&#39;t give you a 110-page order to make fun of,&quot; Kumar says. -
If even one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (GNT), a judiciary established in 2010 to stop the rampant pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction, leading to pollution.
The stakes are unbelievably high: in the less than 60 years since independence, India&#39;s massive industrial development has gone from being a primeval jungle to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development has not kept up with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for development by new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court&#39;s decisions &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;impossible.&quot;
Sometimes court decisions really cannot be enforced within the deadline set by the court, environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani confirms.
However, impossible deadlines also have a positive side: at least they force the responsible people to move.
&quot;His main goal is to shake up this system,&quot; the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects: on its account, the cessation of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, they also try not to forget about people: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We may close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
&quot;People will lose their jobs,&quot; Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of a judge&#39;s pen.
So, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years old from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite the plummeting popularity and flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on incoming and outgoing vehicles from the Delhi government, and also made an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having first asked the factories if they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even traffic accidents began to come to the attention of the courts, popular anger began to subside.
But the principled judge&#39;s most sore point has been the Ganges cleanup program pompously announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges - the sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often ceases to restrain his emotions and turns to shouting.
Do you know what the word &quot;holy&quot; means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge gets excited. -
You go on polluting the river because you think: the Ganges is the Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship and look what you do with it every day.
Cleaning up the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Hindus who bathe in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Save the Ganges Fund the proceeds from the sale of his costume, in which he met with Barack Obama, and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the costume was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while at least eight billion are required to clean up the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be the environment.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as a luxury,” says Call of the Ganges activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development.&quot;

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
&quot;China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of opening up,&quot; he said addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group Committee on Comprehensively Deepening Reform.
Expanding opening up and deepening reforms will give new impetus and vitality to the economy and provide new space for economic development, he said.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including introducing regulation of investor access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital, and revising the system of registering residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a greater role to play in allocating resources, enforcing the rule of law in business and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers it grants to companies, thus ensuring that companies run their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
&quot;The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions,&quot; the statement said.
Additionally, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or &quot;green card&quot;, will be facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and issues of training professional judges and prosecutors.
Premier Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended, according to an official report released after the meeting.
