To return to the previous energy level, the light must remove the extra energy it received from the light.
Fac this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a photon.

The following image shows atoms emitting photons, but in reality photons are much smaller than the ones you imagine.
Photons are even smaller than the things that make up atoms!

The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the complexity of the focusing process and the number of lenses needed to cover a range of focal lengths are much greater than in fixed-focus lenses.
This is a problem that is even more rare, since target manufacturers reach ridiculously high standards in target manufacturing.
This allowed zoom lenses to produce images of comparable quality to those obtained from a lens with a fixed focal length.
An alternative disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) at the lens is usually smaller.
For this reason, inexpensive zoom lenses are difficult to use without flashing in low light conditions.
