This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a hypothesis already widespread, but also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown in the upper part with a light or orange color in the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed spindle called rachis, but show other characteristic elements of feathers – beards and beards – the researchers concluded that rachis was probably an evolutionary development arising from its other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or impression. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the fluff of a chicken.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two policemen and injured more than 20 people.
The governor's office said nineteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh militant (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun works according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller Rossby's number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

He added that "they should not, however, be required to assume obligations that exceed their level of development, responsibility and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
No one can guarantee at this point that any intervention in Iraq will stop sectarian war, increasing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and consensus building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first recommendation of the 78 he made was to start new diplomatic action before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is 'very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate.'"
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll said, and at least 2 were hospital staff.
During a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the soil," said Glen Cushind of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeological Team and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert into an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following clear procedures.

"Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, 'We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop.'"
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The crash road was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder in Edinburgh County Sheriff's Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other areas of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and courts have ruled that publishing photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists appear to be playing with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects.'"
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters it would make no further comment at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn based on borders from before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters taking part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers, with the test monitored and its effectiveness subject to evaluation.
Under a partnership between NPWS and the Sport Hunters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Hunters Sport Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martely's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people, have been reported.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company said were 'not serious.'"
"The ministry responded by saying Apple's delay was 'truly regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana's emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night two months earlier. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.'"
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed 'Gold Powder,' commented that 'The moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her. I hope he's in a better place.'"
Out of 1400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during her 2010 campaign for federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34% of those surveyed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the ends of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relay events, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to control pain, which are forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before early February using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been the earth's source of water, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his presidency earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parks and parking facilities connected to public transport are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport brought into discussion the possibility of organizing the match behind closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between endemic Darwin finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of designs. It can be run into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into the shape of sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball out of them.
The moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Debris from sewage systems has been found in homes in the minon towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women shared in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're doing it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space on a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-tall rocket to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel offered us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them we have several medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; Each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make jumps over great distances and shoot with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) with the help of smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move around undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment, then throwing themselves at their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) ends up being isolated from the main population they come from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., expel from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they make shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the peak predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing in its path escaped well.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had its tongue forked. His diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurians, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could handle it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a brook.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting, rich men liked to do banquets where they lay on their sides while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; The shops were just counters that gave straight into the street. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In the Scandinavian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Earth and named it Greenland.
But regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the declaration of independence can be read the words: 'Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is nevertheless known that, in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) had been kept rolled up.
So the marking was probably done simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was run by the 'Vichy' French. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, dubbed 'Operation Dragoon'."
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or city-state; It also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state, often uncooperative, authorities to enforce its decisions.
It also lacked the authority to cancel laws and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is home to nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because of Japan's island groups, Japan is often said to be geographically an 'archipelago.'"
The beginning of Taiwan took place a long time ago, in the fifteenth century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the formats of the digital camera's image sensor.
The somewhat confusing 35mm format is actually 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to her, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
It was during this period in European history that the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle was really respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
With a reserved response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unbridled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were one of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, over the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting for the throne in the majestic palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to be successful.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the class-based armed hierarchy, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond worldly things. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things you can see are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also called the 'Giza Necropolis,' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
'The 'trait up' marking looks like a V and the 'down trait' marking looks like a staples or square missing the bottom side.'
Upwards means that you need to start from the top and push the bow; Down means that you need to start from the frog (that is, in the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bow trait usually generates a softer sound, whereas a downward stroke is stronger and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own directions, but remember that printed directions for bow features are there for musical reasons and normally need to be followed.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed in Versailles before the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the epoch in European history spanning the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is ruled by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for curing personal injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 CE.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what Byzantium markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the X - XI centuries and in the XIV century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances during that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds originating in the same organic region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel pushed aside by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration in a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
"Such children are called 'untamed' or savages. Some feral children have been kidnapped by humans (usually by their own parents); In some cases, the child's abandonment was due to rejection by the parents due to severe intellectual or physical impairments."
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; and others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is included in the software, designed to interrogate, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there is.
We perceive the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of the children, who were not covered in the house they had previously been in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can observe whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage still manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination make that in each generation the direction of variation is dominated by one or the other of the two genetic funds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so entails serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were leaf proteins and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved the 'protein problem' in a similar way to chimpanzees on today's savannahs."
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which were added the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, clashes over system, process and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last forty years and would be fought seriously, by "delegated" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became useless almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were set in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the ocean to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them around the house to give them easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, usually in the care of deer who were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheepmen. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Wagonways have been built in England since the sixteenth century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly erratic roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that rails would be more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning righteous man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There is bipedal specialization in fossils of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap posters.'"
On July 8, John Nixon's first public reading of the document was given in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds one can still see many features similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in the jargon of computer science.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue to an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originated from its ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin beetles and bedbugs are nidicole, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their best interest nor in that of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have used mostly classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to work for some time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the DNA is genetic material hypothesis.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Organised tourism around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small country settlements to head to their workplaces, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone somehow has to do with and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the past 2 million years.
They all participate in society and use transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or bridge collapse are rarely encountered.
Why do transport systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail day after day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying the flow of traffic is unfortunately difficult, since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; As a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These ratios are useful for planning, designing and operating road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates for mating more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
Seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that drains into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates the water of thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used on a daily basis by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholic.
People have known since antiquity some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
Rather, he was reminiscent of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it would transform into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing aids appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no pulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There may be more maria in the near part, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or enjoy.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes some people want to do what they do, and what it is in their environment that may or may not cause certain things to do.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behaviors can occur when managers start leading former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people are turning into unrecognizable individuals who believe they need to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Many times, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones that may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets standards for each of its members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used in an efficient way, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works as one to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology are physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows narrowing the research area and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
AI research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but some software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often a teacher would enjoy taking his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire fine art while in class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since undergraduate students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'forces students to be more aware of the world around them.' The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study far beyond the regular school day.
"Proper use of blogs 'can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasting an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the U.S. is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling says she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but it does not look expensive.
Women need to keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be stalked, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you turn down a man and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to him by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the Old Medina it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and lots of all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city, an information effort is required to understand the status of the fighting that is still being fought in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla rides in Africa.
To travel through Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, remote places."
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of this country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are entrance and daily conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
Most of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed onto reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British colonizers appropriated and therefore, for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles), from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangrove swamps, though – they also encompass some of the last redoubts of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are convenient and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby sights such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches down the Oyapock River to link the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With its two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The free passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous population group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Gigantic Province of the Indies,' was born in the sixteenth century after Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with efforts, preserved much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where you can buy tickets for polo games, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley face to face with the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted all over the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably receive British and American currency; Check with landlords ahead of time to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you need to change them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived frim more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, bison, elk, bear and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city lies on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located between two ports. The most famous of these are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most of them get shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide range of shops arranged along the waterfront. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One"; It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but New Zealand or Australian ones would do better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you have fears you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes full of whipped cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate lives up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppery in price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be encountered outside this period.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks get scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or procure other documents for your destination. (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to catch a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as navigating through the ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can hardly be found.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in the mood and stay in the premises.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Whoever will drive to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During blizzards, in a very short span, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blizzard snow or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to land voyages undertaken to see Africa's breathtaking wildlife, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
'A walking safari (also called 'a walk in the bushes', 'hiking safari', or 'on foot') consists of hikes, either a few hours or a few days."
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, coronavirus cancellation policies didn't extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available or if you don't like wearing ironed stockings, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others, several minutes are required.
Filters differ from each other in efficiency, and if you're worried, consider buying water in closed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are unfamiliar with at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy tax-free goods in certain places.
Travelers who are about to visit high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the toughest traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often crossing through remote and undeveloped areas.
If you're used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep gradients, narrow lanes and dangerous curves prevail.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important that they are strictly observed.
However, bizarrely enough, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are commonplace, with apples used all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Often popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'liquid' depending on the amount of liquid."
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without further ado, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes seasoned with simplicity, with the predominant tastes preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety concerns because a rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls out of the saddle but is left with one leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him after him when he chases. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's most sought after climbing place, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their top. Climbers from all parts of the world are continuously charting new routes through walls with unlimited potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
"Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums' in English, who organise entire holidays around skiing in a particular place."
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the seventeenth century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called unmarked skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but which usually does not involve alpine skiing or climbing tournaments, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on neat pistes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do it at passport checkpoints.
Likewise, whoever has a Schengen visa does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money and documents to be obtained.
There is no universal definition that determines which items produced are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies depending on geographic location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and culture related to trade is also important to many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you're about to visit is subject to a warning to travellers, it could affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Extreme weather conditions' is an umbrella term used for any type of dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in many forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, marine thrombus and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be mindful of severe weather risks affecting the area, as it could upset their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone to receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely give you the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are quite a few, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the sex (X) is not declared or documents updated to correspond to the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current to deep waters can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion trying to swim backwards against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move towards a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock manifests faster than culture shock (less of the honeymoon euphoria persists), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the customs of your native culture.
When they had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country requires a process of adaptation.
The world doesn't always expect patience and understanding to be needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and see them silently before the show starts.
Usually, the noise made by tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The sound and light show looks like something out of a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km to the north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula unite to form this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km range of Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4892 m.
In remote places with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cellular phone because you must be outside, with an unobstructed view of the satellite, to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions requiring remote transmission of voice and data.
Your local phone service provider might be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending university without jeopardising their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of delayed courses abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid when enrolling in these educational programs.
"Finland is a great place for rowing. The Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in Holland the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifest in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and customs clearance.
The only way to make it pass faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a big stack of money for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
It's not cheap, though: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times as much in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge as required.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transdniestria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a hectic, developed and modern commercial center, located around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are dotted with traditional 18th-century red tile roofs as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some graves.
It is worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become outside the borders of the country following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
Bus Scottburb 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still alive many men and women who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected outages are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype that does not conform to reality, in order to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is 'bien élevé' (well bred). It will help you deal with it much more easily."
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is home to a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
These too can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. Unique size for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a noun form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of them are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to pay more attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means drag, while carro means carri.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Obviously, anyone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in remote areas that have favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom gazing, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the imperial court.
Plants look nowhere better than in their natural environment, so don't fall prey to the temptation to pick even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
"But being in the 'upper tropics,' just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when it's clear, less often)."
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake outdoors to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often meeting at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to its remoteness from the mainland, mammals were unable to undertake the journey, with the result that the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Since areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture has a more highly hierarchical and formal character than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard clothing in the business environment, and co-workers address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the instructions of superiors without question.
