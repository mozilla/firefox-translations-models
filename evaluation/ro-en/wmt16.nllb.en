The UN chief has stated that there are no military solutions in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that Russia's response to military support for eastern Syria is that there is no military solution to the conflict that has been going on for almost five years and that more weapons are needed than to aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban stated Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from the five permanent council members - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial session at the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban and a express regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional puteri have made this situation unresolved.
Ban le Ban requested the five permanent members to demonstrate their solidarity and unity when they successfully concluded an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
The eight-figure care poll shows that Donald Trump has a real chance.
Some even tried to label him as a politician.
Alții l-au numro o glumă.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But regardless of the way some Republicans try to disrupt Donald Trump from the top of the poll, it doesn't work.
Zec from the last 11 national polls showed that Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the digital shot or the real estate mogul.
Of course, this is still premature.
Nimro of all of this does not say that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period in 2011, Rick Perry's predecessor replaced Herman Cain in the poll, giving none of them a win in any state in the nomination race.
And the motives for which the general cheerfulness is so hard to fight are numerous.
But outside groups such as the Super PAC led by Jeb Bush and the conservative economic club Club for Growth admitted Trump's power and began to financially support him.
Below are some figures from a recent poll that suggest that real estate mogul is not just a transient thing:
The figure indicates support for Trump's 180-degree turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, in mid-June, a survey conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have either a favorable opinion on Donald Trump or a favorable opinion.
About three out of 10 people say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are kept.
A survey conducted last week in Quinnipiac, Iowa, concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP candidates are happy if Trump wins the race for the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would not be "excited" or "excited" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would not be successful if Trump wins the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they are not enthusiastic compared to 40% who say the same about Trump).
More closely related to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would not be "more than happy" or "more than happy" if Jeb Bush won the nomination.
The majority of Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his outrageous and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationally believe that the real estate mogul is the right temperament for a president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where up to 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the personality to be a leader, according to a poll conducted last week in Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the personality needed to act efficiently, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament is not what they want in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican allegors are used to this idea.
When they take an intellectual attitude, Republican candidates consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, the question is who has the highest chance of winning the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 of whom have declared Trump.
The situation has changed since the July final, when four out of 10 were tied for the Jeb Bush.
In the past, GOP voters did not sit very well in the future.
In the same period of the ultimate election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry to run for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Whether Republicans or repliats spread an alt candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Rumors have it that a split situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while Trump's support for him will be shared by the majority of the twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September at Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and a majority of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from the support of the majority.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and finally 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
This is almost equal to Tedro Cruz.
The only candidate who can defeat him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation with each other.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters declare that they are in the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that more than half of Trump's supporters say they will not change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that this will never change.
46% say they are open to the possibility of changing their options.
However, the most important opponent to Trump is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as the candidates who declare that they decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump called on immigrants from Mexico to violate the law in his speech to open a sale campaign two months ago, immigration has been a central topic in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic candidates and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
However, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the eye of the beholder, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with authorities is reaching its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican electorate, largely because of their outsider status.
According to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in governance.
People are also overwhelmed by the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% declaring themselves "never-failed" and 21% "nervous about the climax".
Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut at the Prime Minister's Questions.
Still in the limelight, Mr Corbyn's debut as PMQs has been long awaited.
Noul, leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later face his debut at the Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions that are right shortly after lunch; the performance will likely be closely analysed by the mass media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he asked for less theatre and more facts.
A statement also states that he can waive some of the participation and that he will give it to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn as leader, coming after a "ghost cabinet" and after a speech he delivered on Tuesday at the TUC's annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to silence the national anthem during a service held on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and kept the front page of newspapers shut.
Mr Corbyn's decision to sing a national anthem has drawn attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had kept quiet respectfully and had acknowledged the heroism of the British air force in the Battle of Britain.
But a member of the shadow cabinet of Prime Minister Corbyn, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem of the belief that monarchy should be abolished.
In a jury of twelve ministers in the shadow cabinet, he refused to be part of the frontline team for Mr Corbyn, arguing for differences of opinion on economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are building up within the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment as rapporteur on his position on the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes to eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party was very clear in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the cap from 26,000 lire to 23,000 lire.
Mr Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron on the podium in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas from outside sources for questions to address to Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North has said that PMQs imply a level of confrontation too high and that he will refrain from replication and attacks, instead committing to focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges that teenagers face.
Mr Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take the place of the PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that it would allow other members of the House to speak on an occasional basis, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the presidency, Mr Cameron declared that he wanted to give up the political stance of Punch and Judy, often associated with PMQs, but was later acknowledged as unsuccessful in his demersal.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer for a leader's reasoning, the way he leads the Chamber of Deputies, and the position of the parliamentary committee, although critics say they have become a caricature and need profound reform.
Cadro in Joburg: Youth without a home benefit from photography courses.
It is difficult to be a homeless person in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as co-workers found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
I was shot in Jobrourg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money off of it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
The head of JD Sports says that high salaries could damage the extinction.
Peter Cowgill, president of JD Sports, says that raising the minimum wage in the UK could mean greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.
However, it is unlikely that their respective purchasing power will exceed the higher labor costs within the company, he says.
Costumes could have an impact on plans to expand or JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a victim of a collateral crisis created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more than praise and criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest member of the talented duo often called Special Ks,, was unpleasantly drawn in the reflective light of the scandal that Kyrgios had with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a crunch qualifying match played shortly after in Cincinnati, the bench umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have grounded Kyrgios, and the European Union should have grounded him with this gun.
Although he was last seen racing after suffering muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was fiercely defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semi-final Cupei Davis against Angliei.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit behind in the conflict", Healy said.
The truth is that a rocket broke when he lost because of a cramped ankle in the US, but he is not the first player to break or rocket from frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of that.
To be honest, he's mastered extremely well in quite provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
We are an extraordinary team, we have a great family together and I believe that was treated wrongly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, hardworking and integrated in the team, has had no conflicts with other players, has a lot of respect for the dressing room, is training hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I believe he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important rematch, which begins on Friday, and described the community decision as the most suitable for all, but also supported the return of the original Canberra player to the team in the long term.
"First of all, we don't want the team to focus entirely on the rematch and not think about the controversy around him", Healy said.
And I believe that Nick is a very quick climber, as people like Federer and Murray have claimed, he matures under the public privilege and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I believe he needs a time when he is not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, which is good for the team and for him.
Alegeri 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders's has been reduced by half in the national polls.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure lead in the Democratic nomination race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic electorate (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the primary election, the majority of Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're supporting.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their joy than supporters of other candidates.
In a CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage over women and moderates, but the advantage is reduced.
Support for the men's side has decreased considerably and Sanders is only five points away.
Clinton's advantage over the Democratic under-50s has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
Yet Clinton still has an advantage over older voters.
Last month, Clinton faced Sanders with a two-figure percentage, mostly liberal, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
About half of the nationwide Democratic nominees say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she chose to run for Congress.
A sfert ar supports the oarecum reserve and a higher 15% ar supports it simply because it represents a particule.
Six percent of the population now supports it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that current Clinton supporters will be enthusiastic about her joy is high.
Opinions are more amsthetic among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them - enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they are enthusiastic about Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about first-class candidate Donald Trump (35%) is likely to be higher.
When Clinton's supporters are asked by the referent an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a mention of agreement on these aspects and eligibility.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him run - although they generally don't believe he should run.
The question of the second option for the party's representative, the Democratic nominees call it majority for Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden has a second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders increases from 20 points, with Biden running for 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general election; however, the figure is down from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage of people who are not eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is the most important role for a candidate, the electorate of Democrats prefers problems to eligibility.
As in last month, no Democratic or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party candidate in the presidential race.
Democratic or potential candidates perform well in some key features compared to the primary electors of their party.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity-minded and trustworthy and to have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, during a time when Clinton's leadership was a strong point.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is an honest and trustworthy candidate, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent do not believe him or think so.
Alleged Democrats also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, share the same ideology as they do.
Referent to all these aspects, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As the questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with this explanation and say it did not affect the general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with the explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March by the rapporteur on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say that the email controversy has not affected the general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
In the mainstream Republicans, more than six out of 10 say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integral and trustworthy, this aspect continues to raise problems for voters at the general level: only 32% consider Clinton to be integral and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters now consider it to be an integral and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of national electors do not consider Trump to be an integral and trustworthy candidate.
However, both Clinton and Trump are in the running for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson, and Bush ranked first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who consider Sanders to be an integral is greater than those who do not agree with him, but, as with Carson, many have no idea or opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity were charged with murdering a student in the first year of Baruch Faculty.
Almost two years after a faculty student lost his life during an initiation ritual in Muntii Pocono, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and ordered him to be taken to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14kg backpack full of nappies and was shot repeatedly while trying to reach a target on frozen ground.
Dr. Deng was accused of having a headache and then lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call the emergency number after he was discharged and pretended to wait an hour before being taken to the hospital, police said.
But he found the time to change Deng's hair, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the national fraternity, to ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members were beginning to hide their personal and practical assets from the brotherhood before the singer Michael Deng", Wagner said.
He was not able to resuscitate him and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng a suffered a repetite trauma to the cap, trunchi and coapse.
"Many families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals", Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this action by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Superior Court has recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Dr. Meng, were also charged with aggravated assault and complicity in the crime.
"We do not want to hold the responsibility not only of the persons involved, if there is an organization that has authorized the brethren, official or unofficial, or vom trage also the responsibility", Wagner declared at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch Faculty has banned the French and national French and withdraws affiliation with the local representation.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will rise, the yield on bonds will rise and the economy will enter recession.
We know that.
We don't know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers little indication of the timing.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted for 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness of rising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why central bank officials in the USA have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the moment when the interest rate starts to rise over the time trajectory needed to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in play.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the unrest surrounding the rise in interest rates has been exaggerated.
The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis was inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of cheap growth, Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal but still small levels to constitute a seismic shock of concern to everyone.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present a module in which several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate increases can cause volatility in the weather.
But the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
It seems that there is a tendency for the return on capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a further downturn in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent report on what will happen after the Fed increases.
Exactly, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - towards sprešterea riser ratei dobanzi, fairly unchanged over the 250-day period afterwards (average urca of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by strategul chief al Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche has stated that the impact on shareholders tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of interest rate increases and the benefits begin to decline.
Recession is the reality of economic life, but the rise in interest rates often contributes to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is faced with certain conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate or reverse the recession.
More precisely, gross domestic product will be approaching its historic minimum point for an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 surges in interest rates since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than the 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, little is expected to continue, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
An increase in interest rates in an economy so fragile could be risky and raise the question of whether this time there is a difference, Deutsche said.
Market players are preparing for the Fed's decision to increase the market this year, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve's meeting this week at the Federal Reserve, which ends on Thursday.
Although a number of strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC may approve or increase interest rates at this meeting, the term trades indicate a probability of only 25%.
In our study of the post-1950 period, all cycles of interest rate growth to date have been in a super-cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began, the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest Fed cell expected since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, and it's now 74 months and continuing.
The Venro fixed was also volatile given that the market anticipated or increased interest rates and the trend was similar to the dividend rate.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decline in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the cycle of interest rate increases, the yield on bonds declines immediately, Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategy is that these increases in interest rates will determine the appropriateness of the yield between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
Bonds with high yields perform better in such an environment, although there are still precautions regarding the strengthening of yields, said Kathy Jones, a Schwab fixed income analyst.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets are already adapted to meet the expectations of Fed policy.
In addition to the decline of the dollar and the fall in inflation estimates, there are some signs that the market is adapting the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, Jones wrote.
Short-term and high-interest rates, a more straightforward yield curve, a medium-term credit spread-up interest rate, and increased volatility - all of which are characteristics of the market when the Fed is pursuing policies.
In other words, companies that do the majority of their business in the USA will have a profit following the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational debt holders will suffer as the rise of the dollar will lead to the collapse of their producers in the global market space and their debt will be collapsed.
"History shows that stocks of high quality tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in interest rates", Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balances have outperformed those with weak balances after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate hikes, averaging 5 percentage points.
Companies with cash flows from capital and stocks with low or higher volatility also have similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Datrooria is going to become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt to the highest loss margin, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the dollar's growth.
Those who care about economics may also have a win, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio post for being too forward.
It claims that this is similar to its trade rival.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming that the plagiarism prize was Brits.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither of these shows were original.
BBC Radio 3 is transforming itself into Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it is doing something about its commercial stance.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also conveyed to the BBC's bosses that the post of public radio broadcaster prostește and seamana tot mai mult with the commercial adversary.
I have the impression that Radio 3 is transforming itself into Classic FM, although I don't like to use the word.
He also won the inaugural BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, are being held under an alternate name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that I can only copy what already exists on the market", Mr Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
You'll find nowhere else about classical music on Radio 3.
His commitment to live music and production is no match.
"I think it's also important that Radio 3's commitment to discovering new music and allocating new music to the community is important", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to appeal to the public than in the previous period, as the British may have little knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element to be criticised by the BBC during the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee because it was going to follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a talent show bought from the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for a sum of about £22 million.
Do you understand why there is often a discussion about the respective broadcast because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be shown in a BBC-specific manner.
He added that he hopes that the respective corporations will find a golden egg hen in their own yard at a later date when they launch an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future premiere of new seasons of The Voice or spend the money that goes into licensing for high-end entertainment formats.
Online sales recorded the slowest growth in August and the biggest could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the past month, it has recorded the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales have been booming for the past three years, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make face-to-face purchases.
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could determine the retention of spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and transformed the commercial streets of the UK into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount spent in August was the smallest growth since 2000 to date, with growth of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there is always a tendency to rationalize in time, Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers started using mobile phones to make face-to-face purchases.
As a result, an increasing number of individuals who can shop online and can shop in a variety of circumstances, such as cannabis.
But now that it stagnates a little, you can observe or decrease (a crescendo).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, is cited as one of the motivations behind the drop in sales.
In a special opinion, buyers should refrain from making a purchase before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers went to the computer to get their hands on the offer, which led to the demise of many retail sites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when shoppers are more likely to buy, could determine the retention of shoppers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of purchases are currently made through online magazines.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call the fashion magazine in the shopping area.
Following the sanctions imposed on the bin Laden family, Muslims buried the victims of the Macaral crash in Mecca.
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were found walking along the streets of Muslims, the first funeral ever to take place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has injected a partial giant in the construction of the Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the mackerel outbreak.
In a ceremony of walking down the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a mackerel that overflowed the Mecca mosque.
Embraced in white, those who plunged their dead into the drum to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of their final journey, the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place, where only a few days ago a building was constructed through the roof of the mosque, felling to the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after Saudi Arabia ordered a construction group to sanction the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left a soldier with 394 wounded.
In a ceremony sweeping through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, who were killed by a macaral that overflowed the Mecca mosque.
The prime victim was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when he fell to the sea.
Mr. Akram is in the Marea Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage to Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims continuing to reach the city.
Today, Regele Salman declared that the Binladin Group should not have let the Macaralei be ridiculed when the Macara was in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that Binladin Group is partially to blame for the break-in.
The English-language service to the news agency did not provide any details, but said that the company's leadership had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore an oath to uncover the cause of the macaral collapse in the courtyard of Marii Moschei, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the pilgrimage to Hajj which is to take place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the collapse of the mackerel and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree has indicted the group because it did not use up-to-date safety measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Red macaw trees surround the Marea Mosque in Mecca, as part of a massive construction effort led by Grupul Binladin.
For several decades, the Binroladin family has been closely related to the Saudi royal family and has been carrying out major construction projects.
The ultimate leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son of a renegade, family dismembered man in the 1990s.
The eruption was carried out in conditions of strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the regatta to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided to award the deceased victim a million Saudi Riyals and pay the same amount to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of converting creditors into Swiss French are:
Pe piata bancara au aparut already offers two conversion offers in law to creditors in Swiss French, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The disadvantages of this can be seen in the case of cativa ani, where the variable dobro can lead to the majorarea ratelor.
The Transylvanian Bank has just completed the process of converting creditors into French agreed upon by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced a conversion offer for its own clients.
According to cumulative data from financial portal FinroZoom, Bancpost offers a three-year fixed interest rate of 1.5%, the lowest rate ever.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's offer of conversion was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in French due to two successive reductions: a reduced balance with the value of risk commissions and the administration of client payments, then an additional 22.5% reduction in the legal balance.
Both offer reduced rates to their own customers, fata de catro plateau lunar equivalent in law prior to conversion.
Astfel, the Transylvanian Bank reduced the rate by 42.5%, Bancropost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Beneficiaries are entitled to benefit from this.
The main advantage of the conversion in the law to creditors in the CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future crises or the franc, and the credit rambursary will be in the currency in which they collect their salaries.
An important advantage of conversion offers is that they do not face a property re-evaluation, nor do they offer additional guarantees or high-profile returns.
Practically, there will be no further financial and legal analysis of the credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, which is equivalent to the law.
The risk is high.
The problem is that the rate in the first place is in the most interest-bearing format, and the client pays very little of the principal.
Bancpost's offer of very low interest rates in the first three years is advantageous for customers.
We don't know how this situation will evolve after three years.
Marja offers its clients a maximum of 3.25% off the total, and a reduction in costumes.
A possible risk for all lenders with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the coming years (mai mult decat the Libor index - CHF).
For example, the three-month ROBOR was 1.44%, in 2013 it was 6%, in 2009, it was 15%, and in 2008 it was over 40%!
In addition, it is possible to wear high costumes, not mentioned in the initial offer.
It is the moment of decision on the interest rate for the Federal Reserve in the USA.
Lumea is looking forward to the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve in the U.S. will make a crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed the decision was made, now believe the situation will continue for some time and that interest rates will remain in the current range of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event since seven years ago the Federal Reserve brought the ratele to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has developed relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation.
A warned the markets to prepare for growth, however there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.

In 2001 she battled leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.

Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bench for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in a match against Manchester United in the Champions League, ending in a defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
After an event that brought tears to the player's eyes and kept him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred as a result of an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno within 15 minutes of 20-year-old Shaw breaking the PSV defense.
He received nine minutes of on-site medical care and needed oxygen before he could be taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal declared: "I have a double fracture in my leg and am in hospital.
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then operated in Manchester.
This is a terrible guy - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he had difficulties, then played fantastic, and now something like this happens.
In the dressing room I put a mask of oxygen.
Plângroea.
Now that I'm a doctor, I've had the double fracture for six months and will not be playing in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno also seems to have been lucky enough to escape the red cardboard and the concession of a penalty kick.
Arbitral Nicola Rizzoli is not a Mexican judge.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official had a mistake.
Puteți judeca singuri when spun că este fault și cartonaș roșu is a mistake and a mistake.
A very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A tweet to Shaw: "Thank you all for the messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, start the journey to recovery, you'll come back stronger.
Manchester United were routed by the accident of Luke Shaw in the PSV defeat.
The foundation of the Angroliei team is another reason to recover to play the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "He is very unwell.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers or is injured.
Our players never aim to accidentally hit an opponent.
Morro broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against the Dutch national team under Van Gaal's leadership in the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult because I don't intend to hurt my opponent, and when you hear that he's in a very serious accident, it's not okay", Cocu said.
I have never seen a façade.
I managed to see only a few, which were heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] had reached it, but I could not see the intervention on him Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how this is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel like a fool, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado has also arrived at the hospital after an operation by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has a clear risk of leaving England but they are still together.
Victory against Pakistan in the UAE was a difficult task, however, after seeing England's squad selected for the tournament, I do not consider or repeat a 3-0 defeat in test matches.
I would not rule out any possibility of a victory in the playoffs.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but there are good players in the batting lineup and a strong collective morale; we will not be affected by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude of youth.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the level of testar, is a representative or option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth leaving the England team for Test matches and being replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as head coach of Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision to not select Adam Lyth into the team.
A game of seven matches against two good strikers, under difficult conditions, and the reality is simple given that cricket players are judged by their results.
There is no question mark of Joe Root's legacy, for example, until he made the announcements because - and I said before - players are their own selectionaries.
He is fifty years old and may have been a long-time resident of Lyth, but his fate lies in his hands.
Hopefully, if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have some high chances.
The head coach of the Angliei team, Trevor Bayliss, praised the attitude even when the performance was not in line with sales capacity, and I am not surprised by this; first of all, he is a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long it takes to remarket a batsman in a test match.
Lyth had seven runs - as Sam Robson had before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Compton alone has been lucky at home and on the move.
The only regret I could have was that England had preferred Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that opportunity was missed.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I highly rate.
This is a cricketer who is a factor in the X factor and who I remarked early on to Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us in a Trent Bridge pitch.
Arro must at least give himself the same opportunity as those before him, but this will certainly depend on the UAE team's composition.
The idea was that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner holding on to four quicks at the same time, and I'm okay with that.
I see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this sturdy player has already demonstrated that this is a fucking thing.
Moeen may not have been successful in his home county of Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for the county, so the difference is now great.
My old teammate Justin Langer, a first-round draft pick, played in Test 38 as a first-round draft pick before entering the open in 2001.

Zafar Ansari came into the team as a back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his fragile age - an average of 31 for batie and 35 for minge - and might believe this point, but there are not many spinners and selectionaries or optat for tineret.
I'm going to learn a lot from this tournament.
Angrolia have made some changes to the coaching staff as well.
The appointment of Mahela Jayarowardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a master's strike.
Este is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, as he can play in any situation and against all types of attackers.
Paul Collingwood will be coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbridled ambition.
I have always believed that being born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, has intuition.
Sometimes, vocile noiro din vestiar, even if it transmits messages that are transmitted and previous, can bring fresh air into the team.
Co-head coach of Colly Durham, Ben Stokes is recovering from his injuries, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and the EU has no problem with that.

The Brexit campaign could be a profitable one if the economy remains calm until 2017.
For the third time, David Cameron's strategy of renegotiating to keep Britain in the EU is still in disarray, even without the approval of the genius Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC, which is now a major criticism of Europe.
Strangers to and from such figures as Corbyn and Nigro Farages.
A European diplomat has explained in the past that - immersed in a crisis similar to that of the EU - while all of them are provoked internally - some member states are fed with the British agenda of concessions and amendments to treaties, which the majority do not wish.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, TUC decided that they also did not want to do this if it was to erode social protection.
We could even count the self-imaging agenda for Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor attend the summit or bilateral session in a foreign capital, face or pose in front of a local monument, faimos, with or without a local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
This is all about mine.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be seen from the outside under the EU's roof - "Don't leave France alone", Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where it doesn't matter if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor of extreme precaut, is an ally of the state but is running it for 10 years and wants to leave the position before the situation becomes clear, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who are too many.
In 2017, the French president, François Hollande, was either re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to believe that these will help the British who pose, whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - something they do not want either, as the majority have similar separatist tendencies.
As such, some ministers may even plan to make intentional remarks that will help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
Renegotiation was fixed and Britain did not obtain anything of value from renegotiation.
Europeans know from their skin how much more acaparatoare Fleet Street can be and how much more skeptical are barons in the oligarchic press who deprive the EU of scepticism, since they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 intrare in a 2:1 ratio.
He may remember Boris Johnson, a euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-potent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
Including a mix of taxpayers, foreigners who cheat on their phones, and pseudo non-domestics who hold a majority of the important government.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give her the bananas to distract her from the thought of eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of a referendum on Cameron, given that Blair had made a compromise on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch allegatories in 2005, who offered him a card of issuance.
I'm not going to apologize for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who attained a friendship with Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste his time with mine - seems to be in danger of adopting Murdoch's strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake he made then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to cooperate with the mass media, not mine, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position the BBC has left him vacant.
Corbyn's official position on Eastern Europe is what the European Union would call an evolutionary indulgence.
It declares that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative Anglicism might disagree.
This was stated by Hilary Benn, but not by Benn on radio and TV this week, when the circle of friends struggled to recognize that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as minister for financial reasons was a bad idea.
I remember the 70s, when his father fought for TV to be unfaithful to the workers' co-workers, without going too far and without losing his cabinet position.
But Hilary's face was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay in any situation - Bennro said - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians in a private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, raise awareness and mine - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the context of social media, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair to not grant Cameron a ticket of favour in Europe, allowing him to go on a good campaign to support the Labour Party in the referendum, as McDonnell has asserted.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But the basic sophistication of McDonnell and Corbyin about the quality of EU membership - in keeping with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer merely an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism is a central dogma.
As with his sophistication of NATO - Tom Watson is neclintit about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that is careful to cut the costumes, as the British Influence Security Forum said Monday.
Specialists have criticized the decision of the Department of Public Health in England regarding e-cigarettes.
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have been critical of the evidence used by the Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published a report on the reference last month and described the complexity of the analysis.
Some researchers have doubted the robustness of the data and have shown that there are links between experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the extraordinary fragility of the PHE foundation and made its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ put the claims and fundamentals of these questions into question: solid earth or mixed earth.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policy must be based on evidence of effectiveness.
Or stated that it is expected that the PHE statements according to which current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than cigarettes are fundamentated by a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting of 12 people involved in the development of a model of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) that summarized their opinions on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which the CEO said he had not received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
He added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the primary funding of an e-cigarette manufacturer but there were no reports of any funding being received from the tobacco and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
Now that I have provided arguments on the basis of which the panel members have been selected, but when they are counted among the most well-known e-cigarette manufacturers, some of them even declare the industry's financing profitable.
Other participants in the meeting are known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the PHE's section on tobacco control.
The research results of a group of researchers convincingly demonstrate that there is solid evidence of the adverse effects that most producers have in accordance with most criteria, McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that electronic cigarettes are a driver of smoking amongst copycats or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, said he had previously responded to the BMJ's claims.
El a declarat: E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking
One in two people who have smoked their whole life will lose their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHEs are clearly bound by a public information reporting the information they provide and the information they provide, given the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative relative dangers of the tutunul.
Each year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related illness and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking amount to 2 billion lire.
Expressing the clear evidence of the current situation - namely, that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effects on smoking - they do not meet national obligations.

A cheerful and imaginative voice now makes no doubt that this is a global arms fair, organized by Amnesty International to underscore the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International and the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using Ad Space Hack Packs, a 6-litre package from Allen about which he claims that facilitates access to approximately one-third of the advertising space at bus stations across the planet.

According to Gavin Grindroon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists pose many questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are working with activists in protest movements, realizing that their art must go out into the real world if it is to have an impact on society.

The film, produced by Amnesty International, has had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP which offers pro bono profit, while the graphic designer and artist who offers voice-over profit is also free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Leverro, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms trade - with a goal gap in ExCel's calendar - and thought we'd offer the campaign he's trying to avoid.
I'm playing with realistic advertising, but with animation and color, I've been a big fan.
"I did a great job of helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the trade", said Tom Davies, representing Amnesty International.
Now, the UK authorities need to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the public.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from the ExCeL interior, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.

Violinist David Grimal: In the time of Bach there was no world tour.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked as munceau, artists and commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the greatest artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a project less than ordinary, rightly called "ciudat", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire to become a conductor, and thus face sa fie cel putin ojul curiosity in a classical musical play.
Les Dissonances was this year's Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the orchestra's founder, and a Monday, when the principal piano was for the cellist Xavier Phillips, Enescu's lucrative composite being a nelipso.
Both spectacles, disfastened on the stage of Athenaeus, and the public displayed an alt-style interpretation of classical music.
Les Dissonances made its debut on the music scene in 2004 and was, at the time, the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
This is true, for some musicians, the need for education is either to become soloists, or to become interpreters in orchestras - I speak of instrumentalists, and not of composers.
They are formati as "munrocitori specializzati".
It's the same impression that you need a conductor.
On the other hand, on the stage, for the audience, the entire musical fetishism area is focused on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, other face marketing.
So let's not talk about music.
So if we deprive this world, we have some muncitori qualificati, which is stupid, and an audience that cannot listen, but must deprive, which is stupid", David Grimal considers.
The violinist has said that this change in the way he performs music has come as a result of "musical failures" in his solo career.
I was like an athlete at the highest level who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to win multi-money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years later, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I never saw the creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So I never felt the sense of continuing on this road.
I have decided to believe in the Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one else was doing anything like this except a conductor: "Musical light, extreme conservatory, never dorea such projects".
"How do you imagine marketing a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra are dependent on the success of this project to live.
In the ten years of the ensemble's existence, the absence of a conductor has proved to be a fi o piedica in musical acts: "Curiously, with cat cantam a more complex repertoire, with cat cantam a simpler one, because all musicians are obliged to be present in opera and not only in role", argues Grimal, adding that the Sunday show "74 de direiori peeram scena".
In Grimalro's opinion, Festivalul Enescu is one of the "foarte curajos", precisely because it invites Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the world's greatest orchestra is present, singing and playing three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invite this strange group".
In the temple of the orchestral tradition, such as this Festivalul Enescu, there is a place and an interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Vorbindro about the opera lui Enescu, violinist acknowledged as a symphony of Romaneasca music to a celebrated Roman composer, so incat had no need of a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romaneasca music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal militeaza for changing the way in which classical music education is conducted, considering that "the profession of a musician, as organized as Astazi, is a death experience" and that "the viitorul of music represents insasi music".
We don't need to go around the light five times a year if you don't serve the light.
In the time of Bach there was no world tour.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who were munceau, who were artists and commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, and insatiable at the same time as I am in the service of music.
If we don't, we're in a system where creativity suffers, there's no more freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of the producers of romanesti inainte and postro aderare la Uniunea Europeanana: "In Romania, before entering the EU, aveati legumes and meat are good".
To enter the EU, sanitary laws had to be adopted that were not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are now in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Where music happens the same thing, this is the same logic.
Les Dissonances face rosii may not be too beautiful, but when the taiem are rosii adevarate.
In an ideal world, music should be brought back to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and this can be done from the outset with educational policy.
"When I consider - as I do with Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, I reintroduce learning in school, I reintroduce television concerts and through this education there is no need to sell musical subproducts", Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, but over and over, this is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will sing the instrument, being, above all, a musician.
I'm talking about a completely different education, if I want to be a soldier, I have to be in a certain way, if I want to be a musician, that's a whole different thing.
After your parade, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward for an alt-type of a musical face comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they believe are their limits": "Musicers discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and hence after a concert their zambitori".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision for music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideals", or a publicity discussion organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Institut Aspen Romania.

Cinema City is looking for "Micilero Voci Mari"
Cinema City is launching the biggest provocation for children: a double feature with two characters from the superproduction "Crăiasa Zăpezii 3D"
Do you have a child who is super-talented and spontaneous, and who likes movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of a campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious copywriters, aspiring to become future startups and care for children between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City searches for "Micile Voci Mari", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to play the double characters of a famous animated film.
While in the decade classique there is an emphasis on the appropriateness of the voice of the actor to the character specific of the animated character, lately, the creation of the story is also considered by those who will be interpreting the voice, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we have launched an unprecedented campaign.
We strive to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our competition.
I want to be part of a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the replicas are funny.
"I want to be distracted and I want to be part of a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager at Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organises a pre-selection where 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected who will have the opportunity to give a rehearsal in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents need to do is access the micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Next, he must select one of the four films available on the platform, download the text that the child is going to read, and then the child will register to play his own dubbing version.
Four films about friendship, heroes of the basm, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the trial: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Gardianul Lunii 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala celș 3D" and "Albinuța Maya 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their vision fulfilled and each will double down on a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Crăiasa Zăpezii 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx's earnings are mixed, with the fiscal forecast for 2016 being scad.
FedEx reported disappointing results for the final quarter, with the shipping giant reducing its profit estimates for the full year due to low demand for transportation services and rising costs for its land transportation division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5% in the pre-market trading area, 45 minutes before the bell tower opens on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, a 20 cents cut, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predict a figure of $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decline is estimated to have occurred despite a price increase of 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on 4 January and the additional measures for the transportation of goods by land to sea or by sea, which will be implemented from November.
The company said it expects earnings to continue to grow from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and the growth of online commerce.
Fred Smith, president and CEO, said the company was facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade.
The holiday recruitment plans were announced the day after competitor UPS announced it planned to hire 90,000-95,000 extra workers, about the same number of recruits as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the latest survey by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated the total to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transportation, which has led to the stagnation of registered receipts from its Express unit.
It exploded in online shopping and bounced the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, revenues from the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues were virtually stagnant due to higher costs for cash packages and insurance.
The unit expresses a record or increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while the recorded revenues from the freight division decrease due to rising costs.
In the pre-market trading area, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
In March, the closure was down 11% from the previous year's level and by 17% from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting of the past year, policy makers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a month of a 27-foot Honduran mansion to decide whether it's time to raise the interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting hall, there will be a mural or a Statelor Unite mural.
Harroesta is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's president, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
In the wake of the economic crisis, the Fed leadership confirmed that there were three unwritten tasks: financial stability.
And this three-month-old debt could be factor X in a decision that is too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is prepared for a stimulus-free, unprecedented short-term interest rate offering that will be almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicates a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil on global financial markets may lead to Fed officials already taking precautions against increasing volatility by increasing the federal funds rate of reference - even if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
Obviously, labor market and inflation are the primary and main aspects that will follow, said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
I believe, however, that if this is an excuse to not increase interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the global market is sufficient to give it reasons to wait longer, she said.
There is now consensus on the Fed's decision, which in itself is causing instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg anticipate or expect an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to recover, a key indicator that shows that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases interest rates, except when policy makers mitigate the strike by promising that they will spend a lot of time until the next rate increases.
On March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The move has been a wake-up call to expecting the Fed's policy makers to keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's not surprising that the Fed is going to raise interest rates right now", Lonski said.
If the Fed's decision-makers do this, they should take a deep-seated action in their policies to avoid panic on the financial markets.
Other experts have stated that a rise in interest rates will calm financial markets because it will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first step toward a slow recovery in monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that the interest rate is expected to rise this year despite ridiculous objections from liberals that there is no need for more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs began in August, the growth of the labor market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years, and near the level the Fed considers to be total employment.
Wages earned or presented signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policy makers said one reason was the temporary effect of the sharp decline in oil prices.
Economics can and needs higher rates given the labor market tensions, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to spiral into a state of volatility later this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16% below record highs in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would drive global growth down.
The market reculled this month, with the Dow index now being about 10% below its May peak.
For Fedro decision factors, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation when interest rates rise.
"Without the financial markets and the reports of the Chinese economy's weakening in recent weeks, we're not even close to meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that we will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will impact the US economy and almost no date to base further events in China", Oliner said.
The global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so it should not be taken into account in decision-making.
In reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority worldwide.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
It simply alluded to the then-president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Fed and the Fed could "sustain" monetary expansion as a trigger for a global market crisis.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly crowded, Fed officials are not only expected to monitor progress in high-level areas, but also to consult with high-level central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
His decision-making process is more art than science, said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that the Fed has a history of over-reaction to changes in the financial market that have nothing to do with the economic base.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that has supported the rise in interest rates, cited as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
The financial crisis that has affected Asia has prompted the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, despite the limited identifiable implications for the development of the U.S.A., Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reiterated their concerns about the respective declines.
The Fed should only address the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The last period of agitation did not rise far from the level respectively, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get into a situation where we are afraid of raising interest rates because markets are overwhelmed", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not believe it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polling, despite attempts by Nine to broadcast on the Today Show about the party's leadership change.
The urgent relocation of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey the consequences of the changes in leadership of the liberal party has not brought about a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning show on Nine was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was premiered in London as part of a series of broadcasts that ran over the course of four weeks, including Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This Christmas season at a distance didn't seem to count too much for Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today's record is slightly higher than the audience of Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but the numbers are smaller than those of last Tuesday (343.000).
Today a tiny difference compared to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000 rounds.
From September to December, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today is 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened in the past few minutes.
This morning, not only the Eastern Parliament was affected by the current of change!

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to meet to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of gunfire at an airport in Siberia.

Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired a series of rubber bullets in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to the statements of Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, some of whom threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Dr. Dhakal claimed that police forces used tear gas and then fired it into the air before the use of rubber gloves was re-introduced.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear what rubber bullets, which are known to kill pot, but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, or cause so many deaths.
The Ciocnirea was the latest event after weeks of violent protests raging in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claimed that noile provinces were established on the basis of noii constitutions and would dilute political influence.
Protests continued in the west of Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group had their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in a violent coup on 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution - however, it was an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, which governed the central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but the legislature has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, Kathmandu, the legislature voted to sign the draft constitution and officials declared that the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.

Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetics with mild obesity.
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity, type 2 diabetes, and diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatment.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, denumite and bariatric surgery, folosesc method diverse for a stomach ulcer.
This reduces the sensation of foam and limits the body's ability to absorb food.
De-a lung-to-ring, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
IMC, or unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and that people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC-roul by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data from 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the esophagus - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI of surgeons decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of people receiving non-surgical treatment for diabetes remained almost the same, at 29.
Among those who have undergone surgery, diabetes mellitus has a complete cure of 36% and a partial cure of 28%.
In the treatment group by medical method, by comparison, only 1% of the subjects were fully cured and only 2% were partially cured.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect the level of glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimum level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group by medical method, the percentage was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved glycemic control - reflecting improved levels of hemoglobin A1c - has reduced the five-year mortality rate, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical procedures.
In the fifth year, compared with the group with gastroctomy in the forehead, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), experienced a significant decrease in BMI (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and showed a ridiculously lower probability of complete remission of diabetes mellitus (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of Swedish people with severe weight that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the study, patients who had undergone bariatric surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying after 15 years, compared with a group who had tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit for patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said this was an optimistic aspect for people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
This is where this paper is critical, as it claims that this surgical procedure is safe in the lower BMI group, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone adds that patients and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously", she said.
I believe that once these genetic changes accumulate that have short-circuited the body, predisposing it to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe. - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama declared, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has conveyed an appeal to end violence in the mother countries or refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics students, the beginning of a 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even each continent.
A further point is that, although admirable, the response of the countries of Western Europe to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he declared in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
This is a wonderful place for a few thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring about peace and genuine development, especially through education, in Muslim countries.
In essence, we must think of ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of oil.
Never have to solve these problems, he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response from the United States had generated a barrage of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know that his motives were powerful but he used force and generated unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who ingest hand detergent in the last four years.
According to the Georgia Center for Anti-Doping, the U.S. Anti-Doping Centers reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who ingest hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Center for Anti-Doping, cases of ingesting hand detergent by children under the age of 12 and reporting the anti-doping center to the highest level of 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Copy the most frequent access to these products, and, in fact, one percent of them reach the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez stated that some children deliberately use detergents while others use them to impress their friends or to respond to social provocations.
YouTube can follow a movie that presents teenagers as a detergent to create a cheap drink.
It seems that teenagers mix detergent with drinking water and alcohol to get a drink together.
Small copies can be attracted to the detergent by the mirosul.
"A child should not think that it will hurt them", Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types of hand sanitizer are perfume ones.
Hand detergents with the aroma of cabbage, grapefruit, orange are the most attractive for children.
Male laxative detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Except for the young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a very concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Anti-Oversight Center at the University Hospital of Kansas, for Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
As such, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey at the table, but people make these hand detergents insanely affordable and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume multalcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old baby who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of hand detergent with a scent of poppy, arrived at the emergency room for first treatment.
Avea alcoholemia179, twice the amount of alcohol a grown-up is legally considered to be under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a physician at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was so tired that he could not walk when the emergency room stopped.
The doctors monitored him overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain injury, as he fell and hit his head with alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was a scary experience", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could not have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic wet products or towels and never leave hand detergent at the disposal of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with decroase.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizer containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities presupose that the product contains methanol, or a lethal substance, and no ethyl alcohol, specifically as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their professor by putting antibacterial products in their classrooms, according to a police report.
The professor is very allergic to hand washing and has banned it in her classroom.
The police considered that the plan was unsuccessful and a disciplinary problem for the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There is no longer any misunderstanding about Celticro.
Griffiths dismissed the rumors about Celtic's incomprehension, Deila admitting that Hoops are not in the cel mai bun moment but are about to return.
Hearts is facing a SFA referral on charges against Neilson and Warburton for being cautious about the January acquisitions of care units affected by the team's unit.
Dons has grown the difference to Celtic by five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first leg brought the Aberdeeners a close victory over the Hamiltones at Pittodrie, with the Dons scoring a five-point lead against Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles the bells legate of the foolish.
A rumor of a misunderstanding has surfaced at Celtic, Griffiths's demontage, who insisted that he and his team not be subject to increased pressure as they prepared to face the Dutch league leadership.
Now I think we feel the pressure, I think the players are waiting.
The absence of Scots in the title race is boring the Dutch - de Boer.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "The Netherlands never transmit the results of Celtic's matches; why?
Because there aren't any Rangers there.
Here, we're not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
There is talk of Old Firm.
It's a conversation about both teams being controlled, and that's where the interest is headed.
The tension is high in the Old Firm's furniture and not only the Scots want to see these furniture.
Voiro shimba the situation, promises Deila.
Ronnie Deila accepted that Celtic were struggling but the Norwegian boss promised to change the situation.
Malmo's defeat and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by a defeat to 10 man-only Aberdeen, who are now in the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
Deila declared: "Celtic had a period before and they are coming back.
We don't want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what is happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because they are the best players.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Prudence is Warburton's referitor to the January transfers.
Despite comments in recent weeks suggesting that he might have identified some goals for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton has been cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the Ibrox team unit.
The former chief executive of Brentford University said: "The transfer period in January is very different from the transfer period in the summer.
In the case of players transferred, there is a pre-season period when they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you'll get worse if you bring in players that aren't necessary.
Celtic are aiming for Michu after retreating.
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested that he may withdraw his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and never managed to leave the country in the summer.
Hearts faced off against SFA referent Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when they eliminated Paterson and lost 3-2, but the red card was cancelled after eight months.
Neilson recalls his statements, insisting: "I am not questioning integrity, I am not commenting on performance.
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle.
Invincibilul Hibee was blamed after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, ahead of a derby with Edinburgh and Tynecastle.
It was a derby era and it was the excitement of the moment, a striker-roul said, adding: "There is no need to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.
Tannadice Council are confident in the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board members still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but agree that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get them back to the boys in shape", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for the murderous victory against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must go along with the desperate Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league win, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to a penalty kick in Adam Rooney's first replay.
McInnes declared: "There is no team that has won anything, in a cup or a league, and that has not won a match like this.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it is rising.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 in the three-month period, with the number of people currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell quarterly to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The authorities' long-term plans are the basis for a stronger economy.
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the Regatul Unit.
In these 12 months, we have observed an improvement in the labour market in Scotland, with the rate of employment to employment increasing and the unemployment rate falling.
That's why I'm a witness to the Oklahoma execution.
In the course of the day, except for late legal intervention, you will be privileged to be condemned to death.
If it happens, and hopefully it doesn't, you'll be in the observation room in the execution room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
I would like to be one of the four official martyrs of his death.
The invitation came first in January, through the intermediary of his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of pricina approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought this was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
I'm not going to offer a unique perspective.
This is true, journalists can not witness the execution in America and, because the number of people usually asked to be executed is greater than the number of people who are executed, there is a lottery to decide who is to be executed.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reserved representative press locations from 12 to five.
They were elected before the privilege of impartial execution.
I can't face this.
I'll be staying with Richard Glossip's closest friends, as well as developing my own personal connection to the de-a-money line of phone conversations and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often talk a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities said that I could not be a martyr or a journalist, so I would not be allowed to mine a booklet and a pencil to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I'm going to plan it.
I acknowledge that ro fi putut formulae better, but I still think that it is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if I asked.
I-I said that he could remove me from the list of martyrs at any time.
But he wants to present an international report that will write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the campaign against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, died with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files I've made.
We'll be back here with all the details.
Now we can say with certainty that Richard Glossip is a newcomer.
The actions of the salesman following the murder of Barry Van Treese have led to him being charged with complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he won't be convicted of murder.
I believe with certainty that there is not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution is wrong.
And I will look at it from this perspective.
Now I can pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From the mine you will find out how to privesc a man who is put to death in vain.
Peter Moody pretends that the stewardess tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the curse.
Peter Moody claimed that he had stewarded Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy who sold the grajdurile last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the curse.
He launched an attack on the stewards and the integrity department at Racing Victoria, claiming that they were launching a personal campaign against him, the point being to eliminate him from the race due to a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to make this better for the cursor domain and that he was put in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result for the testol for cobalt al lui Lidari, for which there is no explanation.
For 18 months I swallowed the words referitor to the statements about spies and did not want to be sown with vulpea that does not reach the straw.
"I was going to say nothing about that and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes I get so frustrated that everything just pops up", Moody said.
Se knows that a continuum.
Sometimes you react and have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have declared.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I am trying to offer it to this better bun.
The moment they start to believe that this is not happening, I have to give up my job as a coach.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw a bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department had tried to spy on his employees.
"On the following Monday, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart stood in a room with a man - whose name you'll tell me if you ask - and offered to hire him to provide information about the activity there", Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he considers me a treasure trove.
If so, then I should resign all of them because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew the moment and now, respectively.
Should I believe this is personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can hold people outside the training camp responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I having a bad influence on the industry?
Is this a bad influence on industry?
Maybe that's how I see others.
Maybe I should take my license and give myself a piece, and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might determine the thinking of this variant.
But I've reached a point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on them and I will force them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The coach's frustration increased with the lengthy investigation into the testing of the cobalt in which Lidari was implicated and the elimination of the lead determined him to claim that he could be fined his license.
Moody, whose name is derived from the association with the training of the new Black Caviar invention, a label regulates the treatment on the day of the race as "ridicol" after it is applied to the feet of the cailor or cataplasm with clay or clay, which is a regular violation.
Start a regular cursor.
I must assume full responsibility for this", he says.
One of the employees in the company has a grief-stricken face.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the course day treatment consisting in the application of cataplasm, for which stewards open or anchor.
This is a joke.
People who follow these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that this need for rules is too far gone", Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the crash site in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram on the weekend and a subsequent escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and was seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle has not stopped to help the injured bicycle rider.
Luni, a 50-year-old man, turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He appears to have been charged with fleeing the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and high road traffic offences.
Bicyclistul, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to the opponents in wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has been critical of the team's placement tactics as they discuss the two main favorites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson has stated that the arbitration allowed the Storm players to lead the team to a game that won Storm's nerves in the qualifying final played on Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made it easier to refer to the Storm after the team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when a nomit match respectively or a demonstration in rugby league, and stated that the two Queensland teams were not too familiar with wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the team's plaque-taking approach and stated that players simply focused on contact when placing.
Bellamy says he regained confidence after two important coaches criticized the team, meaning they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I never heard Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when he beat with a score of 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything until this year in our defensive systems or techniques, so long as in the last six weeks I have really put the accent on the plaque and thus changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he probably wasn't used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of a football team, recalling his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons who won the championship with Bennett in 2010 playing football as a player.
Wayne talks about the heart-pounding football.
And he argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how thrilling it was to play, Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne stated that he was not interested in black under the unghie.
But now there is a team that can play what I consider to be heartbreaking football, especially among younger players.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought this argument up in 2010, and now wants everyone to adopt his own style of play - no team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
Mie gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somehow worried about what will happen to us.
Six weeks ago, you probably didn't think of us when you thought of the important milestone.
Bellamy also highlighted that the match between the Storm and the Roosters was a more bitter match-up than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos' best game was probably a good one, but I haven't seen it yet, how long has the score been? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our last two tries, is that a palpitant game?
Or is palpitant to pause and not walk?
For me, they are plans.
If they talk about us, it means that I-I-I could meet them at some point.
Storm are free this weekend as the winner will have the right to play home games against the North Queensland Cowboys, Cronulla Sharks, in the final of next Saturday's prelims, the AAMI Park, with tickets set to go on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used fetal phones to help pedophiles send images.
A pedophile used the phone number of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images or copies of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated it into an online messaging service where an alt user sent her a series of indecent images with copies as the subject.
Fata's subsequent investigation and observation of the disappearance of the phone, which he found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
He looked into the phone and found disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After the call, the police looked at the five photos and then analyzed the computer to find the addresses and found a "worrying" search on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with subject copies.
Hogg pretends that he did it to target pedophiles on the Internet before pretending to be a cop to be a spy.
Prosecutor Eilidhro Robertson made a statement for the Dundee court: "A statement that it is a dependency - that it is a dependency to scare people.
He admitted to having done the computer searches but said he did so because he wanted to be a police officer for pedophilia.
He was asked about conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the imagery and about how he had asked the person to send him other photos.
A declaration that he did so to impress.
A said he never thinks clearly when he drinks and that he longs to see images of violence and crime.
Dr Robertson added: "When the baby found the text messages on the phone, she strigated her mother and trembled and plângea.
Fetița saw her indecent imagination on the phone and the accused was confronted.
Fetița was interviewed and a story told that the accused used computer and Playstation to talk to fete care păreau mult mai tinere than el.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, aged 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or making indecent possession of child subjects, and to breaching conditions of parole on 25 January this year and presenting the appearance of 24 March this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, demanded that Hogg not be registered in the sex offender registry because it could be argued that this offence did not involve a significant sexual aspect.
Judge Alistair Carmichael is serving a sentence of up to October, based on social reporting.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for high-profile cases.
He was placed on the sex offender registry before his sentencing.
Robert Mugabe, the president of the Republic of Zimbabwe, transmitted a greeting to Parliament.
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the longest-serving African leader, fell on a podium.
Nu was injured but the filming area of the fall became viral and socialised.
The dissolution of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who claimed that he had received anonymous death threats, threatening to kill Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Luna pasa l-au huiduit during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
The message was sent from a number hidden but this was titled death, the newspaper said after Mr Mugabe's speech.
He warns the parliamentarians concerned that the immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" about the threats being made to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is facing 30,000 layoffs.
It is predicted that Hewlett-Packard will face between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's restructuring efforts and cost reduction in the services sector.
HP will be divided into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from operations with increasingly fulminant corporate hardware and service aflate.
The forecasted availability of the newly-created assets will result in costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise to a more competitive and cost-effective structure", said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition from the corporate to the business-to-business model, Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global clients.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions to its target companies.
It is a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of producing electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was named Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through a massive reorganization of the printer to adapt the shift from the traditional computer to the mobile device.
HP, the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better on better performance.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that teaches important lessons about friendship between men.
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among teenage men reaching their peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Prietenia is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends or a healthy mood, the chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a healthy circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response is often prioritized before the meaningful contact.
Our digital lives are doubled by the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if in reality it is the isolated one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychology calls extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that affect even deeper our mental health.
The inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't really buy happiness.
The main thrust of Friends was to draw attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by their workplace but by their own personality, which they showed through interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when you watch football in comfortable cameras, and Ross' passion for Rachel come from the fact that men can be associated with this situation, even if they often struggle to fully explore their feelings.
As a social worker explained:...My role in listening to suicidal and depressed people shows how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.
Often, people who call us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying is to deal with this powerful person alone, just as the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlights the mice moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much help objective intervention, external, via the telephone, people gathered in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Astfel, if you're attending this weekend's FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, which includes a complete set of film sets to celebrate the event, so as not to invite your friends to the Central Perk coffee shop.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in a Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is Comedy Central's first ever episode - all 236 episodes - with #FriendsFest.
Di Maria marches and helps PSG to give Malmo deoparte.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to establish themselves against Swedish side Malmo.
Next we present the chronicle of the match and the game's reaction.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani and Paris Saint-Germain began the series of Champions League group matches, with a peaceful 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into the start of his debut match in the Champions League with PSG, bringing the French championship to the advantage despite missing a series of opportunities before securing his advantage with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Joining Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's objective was not only to qualify in the best possible way and improve the run to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, despite the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect team, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic having wasted his opportunity to score goals after being replaced by a team from his hometown and club, and beginning a brilliant career in 1999.
"It's easy to win at home or on the road in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next class, even if there are still aspects that we need to improve on over the course of the season", Blanc says.
This is a good sign.
We didn't want to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned after an accidental one of the three changes to the Paris team, which had a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria had a light-reflective preluat in the fourth minute.
When he was transferred from Manchester United last month, the Argentine midfielder was named the man who would take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he handed Marco Verratti the pass behind Malmo's defence before shooting incredibly over Johan Wiland, in a long shot from the right side.
But if anyone expects PSG to win a little bit of a win, they've been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and came on the field with nine national team captains, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was impressive, except for a shot at Nikola Djurdjic who passed the post to Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
On the other hand, PSG players slowed down a few times, passing a few unnecessary passes and finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries only in the first replay and was replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic's performance proved to be more than adequate in supporting his colleagues, though, as he was the one who Di Maria sent in a deviant shot from Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after scoring an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed through the centre of Maxwell.
This goal eliminated the hopes of Malmo's side that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop for Wiland from the distance to repulse David Luiz to keep the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi scored a goal in overtime.
The Norwegian manager of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later claimed that PSG had been in a bad class and that the last match I played in the Champions League was in December last year.
Since then, I've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Jose is also a hatter for PSG.
Or made an excellent game.

The growing Chinese economy, which has been stagnant for a long time, is experiencing a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and high-grade goods are falling by 20-40%.
Xi is insisting on a broader extinction of the global economy.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open up more broadly to the outside world to fuel growth.
China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve its opening-up policy, Xi said at the 16th Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform Meeting.

Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, whether to continue or not to collaborate with coach Darren Cahill.
The two winners this year were in the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician being the only romance player in the major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to defend himself in the face of capricious and sporting caprices.
Adidas's schedule will be completed by the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or to abandon the collaboration.
Now we know exactly what will happen.
I'll see what I can do.
"Singapore is the place to give a response", Martyr Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis, and he is seeking a contract worth about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, or a professional who doesn't want to give up on the moment.

Finally, the proposal of the head of the Federation to pay a substantial salary for a month was rejected.
At this point I feel like I'm out of the country.
Then I'll pair them up, lasam or work in the back.
I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, was not normal, was not respected, was not respected by the workforce.
I am well lucrating with those before the Federation, since when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, which I did not know, to get different opinions from the press about me.
I didn't change because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
I continued working, everything went very well and probably changed and the idea changed.
But I wanted to leave.
If you want to be a new employee, I propose you then marry me on contract.
We have a salary of 400 and a few thousand euros a year, followed by a salary of 600 thousand euros.
I'm not arguing with Burroleanu, but I'm arguing with him on the right.

Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team did well in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

When I saw the movie, I sat with him, a man from Columbus, Ohio, and he simply didn't recognize it: "I looked into my eyes and I wasn't there".
'He was a terrible man, I don't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who cared, decided to take a bath or a nap, and eventually went to the hospital with the number of doctors, who remembered him breathing as Nick drank alcohol.

The strategy identifies a number of factors that may influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Report of activity to the leadership of TVR, respins in the committee: Stelian Tanase risca demiterea
The Culture Committee of the Parliament rejected Wednesday its activity report to the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
For the respingera report, 17 MPs voted, one impotriva respingerii (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abtinut.
The text of the report was submitted to the Permanent Bureaus of the United Nations.
These are the ones who will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting was debated.
"I think that in view of this situation, progress will be made relatively quickly", said Georgica Severin, chair of the Senate Committee on Culture.
He added that "era de bun simt" was also the time for the TVR leadership to present this session, as the Cultural Commissioners meeting was not attended by any representative of the TVR leadership.
It was a good feeling to present the TVR leadership because nobody here has ever been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the Inca members of CA yesterday, about an hour after the meeting of the Bureau of the United Nations, and the staff faxed the TVR conductor inviting him.
I believe that in the moment you are summoned, you are salariat budgetary, platit in public taxele and you are summoned to the session of a comisiilor reunite even if not in place vii.
"Because of your duty to serve, you are an institution subordinate to Parliament", Severin said after the meeting of the Commissioner for Culture or Parliament.
He added that the financial or institutional aspects were discussed during the meeting on the basis of a negative opinion to the Budget Commissioner.
The data I have seen and we have seen how to continue, came up with the idea that this year would be the year, and not the plain of history.
"I would remind you that none of the vines or a few of the commissions that have lost that banking and tax advantage are clear management problems", Severin said.
He added that after the activity report was submitted, the plenary meeting would be rejected following the election of a new Board of Directors, and the latter would elect the director general of the institute.
I don't know who is proposed for this position.
Minrouni is now in front of the face.
It is important that political decisions are made so that this institution can function.
I'm not a man who's going to lie, I'm going to tell you that I'm going to be a genius who's going to be standing here and be fighting.
I hope that those who decide, in the plenum of Parliament, by their vote, will rationalize the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, who have experience and who have a great deal of fairness and respect for institutions and traditions.
I don't know who is, but if you ask me what kind of attitude should be had toward employees, I think it's a hell of a lot of petitioning from the employer, the claimant, the fireman.
"Candro primesti tali sesizari 50, 60, 70, something is putred and we are talking about a financial situation that is a disaster", concluded the chairman of the Senate Committee on Culture.
Since the presentation by Parliament, the president-general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, has sent a letter to the president of the Camerei Deputies, Valeriu Zgroonea, in which he asks the Parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to the salvation and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of TV taxes.
In the letter, Stelianro Tanase requests, alongside the TV tax index area, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the public service television tax, in order to update the provisions on the level of technological change, as well as to regulate the procedure for controlling the payment of TV tax and for the determination of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also issued a provision that would extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become mandators of SRTv for the collection of TV taxes, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, this would require the establishment of a maximum ceiling of 5% on the commission from the treasury.
Stelian Tanase is seeking to reduce the VAT rate for specific public television broadcasting activities and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to 3% level, as well as amending Law 41/1994, in order to allow a first allocation of budget/financial resources for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sporting events - World Cup, Cerbul de Oro, Eurovision.
The argument that SRTv will be in default of pay in the coming months is that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judgments, even if they are not final, and payroll rights are respected as a priority over any high obligation.
The TVR Administration has made constant efforts to reduce staffing and TV production costs.
"As a result of the past decline in the number of jobs and high cost-generating activities, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and TVR News was closed at the end of July", the letter to the president of TVR reads.
Tanase appreciates that the financial situation is disastrous and cannot be remedied by one's own efforts.
"For the support of the institutions of state - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Roman Television will find, sooner or later, that it is impossible to fulfill its public mission", it is mentioned in the letter.
The Cameroonian Chamber of Deputies decided to send a letter to the Committee on Culture.
General to Vasile Blaga, sent to trial.
The general of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Parchetului in the court of appeal of Bucharest.
This case is charged with tax evasion, in a case involving damages of approximately 600,000 euros, and is under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the paza company Axis Corporate Security SRL, a subsidiary of his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married his daughter, Agathe, of Vasile Blaga.
The investigation also revealed that, in order to subvert the taxpayer's and taxpayer's money to the state budget, representatives of a company specializing in providing peace services created an infringement circuit, in the format of several commercial corporations, through which fictitious transactions were evidenced.
"In fact, in the company's accounting there were no fictitious purchases of services recorded, which, in reality, were not provided, thus affecting the state budget by about 600,000 euros", explained the Politia Romana in a press release.
Seirocii has established his fortune in Sanmartean.
Seicii of the Al-Ittihad club has established the fortunes of the Lucian Sanmartean centre.
Since the press has announced the imminent departure of Sanmartean from Ittihad, the interior impresario of Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will never happen.
Boloni is a very long distance east of Sanmartean.
Luerocian plays the titular match of the match and he is good face.
Seicii realised that this is the best cell and that if you give up on it, you will be fine.
I never had a variant that brought an alt jucator, mult mai bun, dar nu a iesit nothing.
"There have been many discussions, such as with Mbarro Boussoufa, but nothing has been done", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihadro earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected vice-president of the Court of Auditors.
The full Parliament voted on Wednesday the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the son-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 registered voters "for" and 108 "impotriva".
The vote was secret, with a newsletter.
Representatives of the former NLP singles who voted against this proposal should inform Digi24.
In addition, liberals have criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and have announced that he will contest the CCR, provided he has a DNA dossier, and is not required to have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, in accordance with the law, to resign from the Senate, for the new function of the Court of Conturi that allows her to be politically active.
The PSD senator will hold the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, a position he will hold after Ioan Anton was repealed, following a decision by the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him unconstitutional.
One of the sexiest actresses ever surprised me: I grew up in a kitchen.
As Bradley Cooper next plays the role of a butcher in the film "Burnt", the actor has made or revealed what he should be selling now that he's done.
In a recent interview, he stated that there has been a surge in the buffet: "I am lucrat mare part of the buffet life".
It was unveiled as a lucrative in the Inca cuisine of the 15th century, when it was assembled for a Greek restaurant, so that later, in the faculty, it would continue on the same route.
The actress explicitly said that her mother is of Italian origin, as well as that she copied a gatit with bunica italiana, relateaza ContactMusic.
Asked what plans he had for the future at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of guy who knew how to plan for five years, "not even two".
"Now it's definitely motivating for me to do it", he said.
"I have a vision, things you can do if you tell me", May declared, asserting that what he wanted from copying was implied.
At the age of 40, the actor has admitted that he sees himself in the near future as a director, modeled after Clint Eastwood, who has been directing since that age.
Ponta, accused of calumnii necontrollate and affirmatii irrationals.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto was condemned to death early Wednesday, claiming that the prime minister of Hungary, Victor Ponta, was not "much better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries who are refugees".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta and his autocontrol was lost and, through the affirmations of his irrational sale, he joined Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Politicienii europieni civilizati nu spun such calumnii necontrolate.
"Remarcile sale au o o o unique explanation: and-a lost total support in the internal politics of Romania", a senior adjudicator of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a post on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that the move would draw attention to and sanction the behaviour of Hungarian government officials, who in his opinion "are a stain on the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to be a response to the provocative comments of some Hungarian government representatives.
"These are a reproach to the culture and values of the European Union; and in their anti-Semitic attitude, and in their private treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!" Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The novel's first novel is adapted as a suitable for rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, while its brutal and legally aggressive nature does not solve the problem.
Sarma ghimpata, aggressive laws, incarceration and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - it will only seem that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries who care for refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in eastern Hungary is in total contradiction to precisely these objectives and values!" the Roman executive underlined.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, a calificat as "simple minciuni" remarked on the first novel by Victor Ponta about the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, assessing that the respective claims were unsuitable for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
Seful diplomatiei hungare a mentionat si martie ca "extremist and mincinoase remarcile" of the first novel tin de crisis interna politica in Romania and a precizat ca Budapesta asteapta scuze de la parte romana.
Szijjarto's report on the declaration made last month by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am impotriva discourses xenophobic ideas sa inchidem granitele, that all those who have been involved are not terrorists, are prostitutes of Evul Mediu and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can first solve the problem of our logistical capacity to treat these people as human beings, then we will treat our Hungarian neighbors as well as our own.
"I don't agree with that", the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Governor of Budapest had decided to begin preparations in the field for the extension of the border with Romania to the fence he was building the border with Serbia, in order to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta declared that Hungary's decision to lift a granite barrier did not solve any of the refugee problem and "scout Hungary from Europe".
This link exists between Osama bin Laden and the Macaralerian prabusiness of Mecca.
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the burning of a coral reef on Friday at the Marea Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company is not "compliant with safety standards", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reports.
The company's directors have received a ban on the parasite until the investigation is completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from the new public contract.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group profits from 4 and expands Mari Moschei, in order to expand into multi-pelerini.
The accident occurred on a Friday evening, during a storm, when the macara, probably a strong wind-raphel de-balanced, went down on the eastern side of the roof of the Marii Moschei of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
Cum le-a inchis Hagi gura contestatarilor is a French writer.
Considered the greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retreating from active life, as a weak coach, capable of performing in a new posture.
After a successful spell with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over a year later as coach of the team he is sponsoring.
After a year of team pre-season fixing, Regele has demonstrated that he is capable of transforming a team that fights to save the relegation into the top flight.
Astro Astfel, after a year of absence, is a registered Viitorul, with Hagi as coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 infrangeries.
Bilantul is one of the top teams in the world, and they are the European Cup champions.
Lucrurile has taken the tournament and is good for Viitorroul this season, intruding the team into second place in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than the lead Astra Giurgiu.
Viitorul are also the best attacking player in Liga 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), and a double-double-double-deck Steaua.
On the other hand, even though he brought in the team with the most experimental players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting the teenagers, and more recently in the starting lineup of the apparutro names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has been to make the Viitorul or the team of the following for teams from abroad, so Hagi has sold this season for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Besides Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in Ligue 1, according to data from the Registrul Comerului.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played a role so far.
It is a legitimate strategy, and therefore cannot be called upon to ratify the treaty on the EU.
Tariffs are a solution for the EU's integration, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors at the Roman Centre for European Politics.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Guinea said that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and that political means will not function in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people have".
Darro are the masses who care about porn and we cannot turn back history.
Migration is a reality that must be adapted to better cat and cat and cat.
In the opinion of Cristian Guineas, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After the passing of the Schengen acquis, Europeans who had already decided to abandon free movement, had to change the Schengen rules: "Schengen is now an animal created in high times and not adapted to the present situation".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the president of the CE, in agreement with Donald Tuskro, did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the forecasts were as if they had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied to the JAI and any state could block any decision.
Therefore, things were very little integrated in the field of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is applied, where the CE is the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculation of the votes was based on the fact that the elections existed.
I didn't want to go into the past.
Because it is a sensitive issue, the apparent reaction of the rejection even in Germany is against the policy of opening up Chancellor Merkel and did not want many countries to defend it as a reaction of the kind "EU sends migrants per capita".
In the meantime, I'm going to have a problem with the schedule because, obviously, this will create a huge problem for the Schengen area and will probably help with the major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory cotele no was really to eliminate, but the subject was only the last to be ever removed?
For the most part, it is best to involve the Frontex agencies in the management of external borders, which means changing the individual responsibility of the Schengen external border members to that of the Community agencies.
Granita Greciei with eastern Turkey and granita Germanyiei with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants is a limitation of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will abandon the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they live, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is defeated, I can't say infinity is the Greek thing.
The problem is common.
Is it possible to solve this common problem without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism to share the primary effort?
No one knows exactly how the cotele vorro functiona obligatori, if it will reach it.
For the sake of clarity or problem: what do you do with someone who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, Sweden or Germany?
The EU does not believe that it is going to be a problem for European countries to deal with migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
There will probably be a single filtering center in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
If the solution of this genus is lucreaza.
The problem is not simple to solve.
I am a country with decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, but I have no experience, like Romania, where the migrant problem is a current xenophobic phenomenon.
Certainly we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precare camps and who are from the beginning of their journey to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% of the time, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but I don't expect next year's valley to be even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we are not used to this problem, nor do we ever see it as catastrophic from a media standpoint.
A vorbeati de tari cu experienta mai mica or mai mare is a type of tari that is made of a single substance.
Does it seem that there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from outside European culture?
But the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they are totro enclavizati.
Now as merge spre declaratii radicali.
Certainly, their integration will be more difficult than in other migration values, since this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
A branch or part of a neuropath that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
Darro mijloace is purely politiensti nu vor functionona.
The cream fortane of Europe is an illusion.
The mechanism of integration into European society must be worked out.
There were some greekers here.
It must be a more pretentious film.
As these people learn the language, they try to understand it, and they never have a foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through convenient marriage.
The problem that is imminent for these people with long-term problems must be separated from their own integration.
If the long-term integration efforts are high, it means that we must consider the situation in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have serious doubts about the quality of the values that these people have.
And if there is an intervention in Syria, which I believe, it does not mean that it will be overnight and that it can lead backwards.
When we arrive at the solution, we see the fortress within the European framework.
The granite is inches high, and the border controls are reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project is now, the Schengen area is as it was constructed, and so on.
It was constructed rather minimally and arranged regularly so that the pressure was too great for the tariffs in which the first data migrants set foot.
That is, we circle around freely, each with his own problems.
In the face of such a val cannot be expected, for some tari are not fac fata.
When there is such a value of emotion, politicians want to know how to do something, and in the long run, there is no big change.
After the attacks in France, we no longer have the most draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a public emotional tool that is installed in both sensors.
And this is so unstable that the week of high incat is so unlikely that you can make decisions on that basis.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belicous statements from the politicians who are at home under the pressure of a fiero virili.
And, then, there is the dramatic case of the inecat child in Turkey and public opinion is emotionally draining.
After this public sentiment is over, we will not return to the motive for which I created this space, this liberty of miscare that is not only for people, but also for the unity.
This is the only real European court.
And I do not believe that Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom from miscare.
There are rules and regulations and that's another thing.
Schengen is now an animal created in the high era and which was not adapted to the current situation.
How does Romania play a role in this crisis?
Ca o tara mica, which believes that if you pull the saproca on the eye and other urechile stips, the theme disappears.
In view of the reality of the migrant values, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not a problem of the tarmac.
We have done this, and it is a legitimate strategy, since after that you can not ask for the treaty of the seventh EU country.
Now, I'm not playing the level of Tara Mare.
Tariffs and tariffs are a solution for the EU, good or bad, but we are not discussing their quality.
As I did in Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis on the Romanians' appetite for Schengen will be very much extinguished.
President Iohannis says it may be better that I have not already entered.
So we move from the dispersion of the intrinsic to the more pragmatic position, giving the objective the next.
There is certainly a risk that Romania and Bulgaria enter the Schengen area as migrants and leave as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen, but rather a more pragmatic approach.
Romania will be part of the Schengen area and the Schengen area will exist, transformed in such a way that external borders will become a common responsibility, and there will be uniform rules for accepting migrants, uniform rules for deporting those who do not have asylum, and uniform rules for tariffs considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its focus on Syria in Ukraine, no one was killed.
Is there a connection between the two focuses, a game al rusiei?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that a greater power means that she is engaged in both American and European affairs.
From this point of view, yes, there is a legacy.
Without military and financial effort to the Putin regime, it is likely that the Assad regime has been in power for some time.
And it was good to be practising before becoming a principal or opponent of the Islamic Statul.
For two years, there has been a struggle between the Assad regime and secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by tariffs in the Gulf and Western countries.
Then they ridiculed the Islamic Statute and now I don't know if we want the Assad regime to be destroyed.
Russia could complicate matters, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a fococross of instability and chaos that cannot be contained.
I can only be strong if I have solutions.
Playing the off-side is just a strategy to save time.
Putin probably waited to make an offer, pressing the button to resolve the situation.
Offer him a drink so that everyone is convinced that he can solve in some way or another the issues that create all of him.
I do not agree with theories that say these people are the creatures of the invisible manna.
We'll see that Putin is more powerful than this.
This button is not worn in the curand.
Millions of Facebook users are accustomed to the "Like" button, and now network representatives are socializing with the pregatesc altul opus, the "Dislike" cell.
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced that the button will be available in the near future, reports the New York Times on its blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button would show a more subtle or nuanced feel to a decat user or a simple option.
However, the ridiculous problem of Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid moments when someone posted a profile or an important event in his life, and that he "disliked" it.
Retelei users, who have reached 1.5 billion active contours, have requested a fine of time so that they have the possibility to express negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is very comfortable for people to "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"Maybe you're not comfortable with that post office", a Facebook spokesperson said.
A variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already a lack of time on Facebook and social media", said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where an article on the subject was posted.
"There's a 'dislike' button on the 'dislike' button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argues that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is difficult to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
In the meantime, support me, if an election campaign in America is approaching, the "Dislike" button will create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours.
Hungary will only accept 70 migrants, or more than a thousand who have come to the southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary has declared a state of emergency in the course of two days along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, inizand a major border crossing point and anuntand that will build a border guard with Romania, according to the DPA.
Masura a atras or a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday I said that I would seal the granite for those who want to leave, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"Dupa cum vedeti, this is totally different", declared the Serbian minister for refugees, Aleksandar Vroulin.
Inainte de impunero noii legislatii privind imigrația, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid their home registration and try to travel to the West, especially Germany.
"Noul" sitting in the Judean Council is sitting on his ass.
Two constructors, in insolvency.
The massive investments made here in the last year, in order to change the institution, are about to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two important constructori care au lucrat here or went into insolvency during the profits.
The seat of the Jewish Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will eventually collapse by itself.
A year and a half after the consolidation and re-functionalisation of the buildings had been completed, the profits had reached half.
The final stage in the European construction era was spent on the treaty days, when the National Council for Contest Resolution (CNSC) rejected or complained to a firm that wanted to contract to implement a technical project for the works that may be executed.
The initial project was conceived by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the builder went bankrupt and the profits were cut, the negotiation process began without publishing a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm intending to update the technical design and then to organize a new auction for profits.
"The negotiations have not yet been finalized, but the contract has been signed, and CJ appreciates that the proposed form of contract is disadvantageous to the institution", said Răzvan Timofciuc, a public relations representative at CJ.
CJ's decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged on appeal by Impex Romcatel.
The Tribunal sent a complaint to the CNSC, which was rejected, as a delay.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start searching for an altro designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility of attacking the decision of the CNSC's Court of Appeal, only after the final ruling has been given to it, in the light of the high-profile design.
Astrofel, the profits from consolidating a building could be re-launched early next year.
Our intention is to resume profits as soon as possible.
In principle, the re-engineering of the technical project should not take long, but rather we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We will wait and see if the decision of the CNSC is attacked or not", Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of profits from the former siege of the police force at the beginning of 2011 was a major factor.
A first profit contract was terminated in April 2012 after a profit of 4.5 million lei was made.
The tender was resumed, the contract being adjudicated by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei.
The profits have been realized so far in a proportion of about 50%.
Initial, consolidation, refunctionalisation and mansardre profits from the merger were valued at 7.7 million lei.
"You, spun tot!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastral Service.
One of the employees involved in the Census Bureau scandal signed an agreement to recognise the offenders, against imprisonment with fines.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, in front of his former boss, Narciza Nedelcu.
A counselor at the Office of Cadastral and Property Publicity (OCPI) was charged with DNA in a corruption case and admitted to the facts.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at Tribunalul Iași, the judges having established a solution in this case by 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascărolu was charged with perpetual intellectual fraud and agreed to serve two years of a fine and community service.
Regarding the facts charged against Dascălu, prosecutors said that he, as a consultant to the Office of Cadastral Affairs, "committed several false verbal acceptance procedures, depriving the contractors of previously concluded service contracts by O.C.P.I. Iași with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Cadastral Affairs and Topography SRL and PFAșa Ște, which unreally testified that the services contracted to the employee were fully performed and that the O.C.I. Iași denied the full performance of the services".
Zilele trecute, former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, and other former and current employees of the OCPI were sent to court in this case, the charges being the discount of services to the companies mentioned, although the profits were not realized.
The preliminary ruling is in excess of 300,000 lei.
A journey into the age of stone.
In the opinion of the president of the FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team for the Olympic Games is costly.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday during a press conference that he was very proud that our country has three teams in the Champions League group stage.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, and for that to happen, it has to go through two stages of caudine wrestling, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualifying tournament", Dedu said.
We are very much looking forward to qualifying for the Olympic Games.
These are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff of Tomas Ryde's technical conducts.
The care staff is composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a secondary coach, a doctor, two masoris, a porter coach, a physical preparer, a delegation chief.
Ne-ro-au was required to obtain qualification for certain things, more precisely material for physical training, of which I had never heard of.
You're all set to make it to the Olympics, and you're going to do everything in your power to make it.
I'm talking about a massive investment, they are multi, multi money.
This is the path to a face performance.
Because right now we are in the Stone Age of Preparation.
"The ship we are bathing in these materials and have been for some time", said Dedu, who said he is trying to obtain the necessary supplies to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and the possibility of hosting major handball competitions in our country.
Now we have the Salà la București.
This is a problem of infrastructure and it is important that the Russians question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in high culture or lighting, the Olympic cartiere is built entirely in a two-year interval.
Before 1992, the current Olympic Zone of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beautification landmark.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success both in terms of investment and in terms of hosting.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to allow Romania to organize a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Domnul Gațu was so civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, and it quickly became clear that a hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited him to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concretely.
"We have all the disinformation, both the EHF and the IHF, but we don't have infrastructure", an FRH official explained.
The former handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM București and HCM Baia Mare reaching the Final Four: "I urge all coaches to be booked in advance, that if not they will turn against them".
Drum bun spre is the world cup.
Romanian rugby team debut on September 23, against France.
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macroovei, said at a press conference on Tuesday that all the components of the Romanian lottery are ready for the World Cup in England, where he hopes to secure two victories: "We are ready".
At the European Union and at universities, we are driving the maximum speed.
We've been trained to give the best cell randomisation in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are grele and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win against Canada, then Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, and the crowning of so many years of hard work.
I wish I could not disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with good results.
"We want to be proud that some players, or small family as rugby in Romania, proudly represent tricolor", Macovei said.
Romanian national team selector Lynn Howells, who has the first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romania proud of its rugby team: "It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup".

For me, it was an extraordinary experience.
For me it is very important that every match in Romania is a national pride.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm their progress in recent years and in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made by the national team.
I wish the athletes success and am convinced that we will be the focus of the event.

A jacket, made of lace from RATP controllers and a folding.
The Parrotland of a tourist.
The family of tourists from Cluj who came to Iași to visit him, gave the excursion ended with a bitter promise.
After experiencing the treatment of my wife and I, I never wanted to be in your classroom.
Unwillingly, he was struck by erroneous information in the form, by the disapproval of the RAPT controllers, and, bonus, by the amendment "as the law says".
The couple arrived in Iași a few days ago, went to a hotel in the Centre and asked for a tourist leaflet.
They also received a flyer containing the RATP trailers.
"Inarmate" with these maps, soții au vizitat Iașroul.
Dar, two days ago, while in Copou, you wanted to reach the Palas Mall.
Since there was no ticket counter at the station near Parcul Copou, they were based on the information printed on the flyer: that you can get a ticket via SMS.
No one told you that this service no longer exists.
Increasingly in the folder, they climbed into a bus and tried to text after the instructions of the folder.
The name nefericire for them, and it made the appearance of the RATP controller team.
Or, as the saying goes, there is no two-year service and it is announced in the press that it will be cancelled.
What is the article that was written in the local press, coming in the evening before visiting the city?
I spoke to the controllers, explained the situation, or said that it was not their business.
Attitude has been very challenging.
Or say that all this potro face is not the only amendment instead of 2 (me and my wife).
"I am platit, I did not want to say that on the day of the visit, the jandarmerie stands and the dand declaratii there!" says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of erratic information from the plaintiff and a controller who "applied the law of blood".
It was not fair, and I had to rescind the RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerating the multi, give the idea and feel inselat.
Grohinion for violators of Vaslui.
Or had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven violators of the Vaslui's law was moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal of Iași.
Magistrates are issuing au judecat the first trial term in a non-public hearing in which the seven teenagers accuse the batjocorit or 18-year-old girl of having asked to be released.
Before the actual commencement of the trial, one of the yeshien judges to whom the dossier was assigned, Viorel Munteanu, issued a form or application to abstain, which was accepted by his colleagues of the court.
The magistrate was activated until this spring in the Tribunalul Vaslui, where he was the former president of the Criminal Section, being the cel care, on 9 April, a formulated admis or contestazione of four of the accused, arranging their placement in arrest la domiciliu.
Currently, the dossier is a complete judgment of the Magistrates' Court of Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, in a file formulated or abstained and Judge Dan Anton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a concubine relationship with one of the violators' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the violators of the Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
The teenagers will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, at which time the judges will reconsider the possibility of punishing them in their liberty.
The next hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal of Iași on 6 October.
Before the Court of Appeal of Iași arrived, the check that the violators from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the Păcurari district, when a car was entering Iași by seat belt.
A car with Iveco cars that were being transported by the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen motorcycle that was coming from the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
Check the circulation from the end of the road.
The car came into Iași by train because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
The road is thus cut short by a few kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, escorting the arrested persons to a chematro un alt transport, to take over the detainees.
Soon, the scene of the accident was sent to the car of the Penitentiary of Maximă Siguranță Iași, which took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, guards surround the rear of the cars, and arrest them at the exit speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as the drivers of the two motor vehicles have a friendly understanding of the damages to be paid", said chief commissioner Madălin Ţăranu, IPJ.
Marirole migrations are a major issue.
Romania is not and will not be ready for what is to come.
What about Europe?
From the beginning, it was clear and clear: the 7,000 refugees who should and should naturalize Romania is, in itself, a small number, given the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if these migrants even want to settle in our localities, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extremely small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to care for them and will lose their patience.
Paralysed by the parasites of the interlopes and paralyzed by the venal political class, the Roman statue proved impotent in all areas.
The neptitude of a-i integration into the tiganese is just one banal example.
In addition, governors of any color have not been able to absorb European fungi, to build modern day day day care, kindergartens or schools, to provide decent medical care, to clean up street poverty, to create decent jobs, or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees be able to settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
What produces a fine is especially hypocritical about what is being treated or such a crisis.
Let us not first praise the bellicose state of the world, but the powerful state of the EU, which is extremely generous in sharing its needs with smaller countries.
Then came the frivolous hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although millions of Rude people are scattered all over the world, do not accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably in order to avoid the national unrest.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoking the horrors of war as a motive for exodus, do not accept a destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Or, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic module in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken later.
We must eliminate the cause, support the union and, strictly speaking, correct policy, pace and investment for the countries of origin or migrants.
There is a peace in Romania and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - even this prevents tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving the country every year.
What is the reason for this?
In this crisis, the European Union will not reveal that the construction is anarchized, fragmented and overcome.
I regret that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, and that the EU also does not have a future plan.
And improvisation and threats are not helping at all.
What, then, is the EU's advantage if Romania's only advantage - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the value of refugees crossing the border as a first step?
At some point, the Syrian civil war will end.
But there is also the migrant crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life.
With politicians like this, Romania is not and never will be prepared for what's to come.

Destiny, practice, improusă are the means by which we are destined.

Two brothers from Tomești or Inghițit somnifere.
I was taken to the hospital.
Two children of 9 years and 11 years of age respectively from Tomești, brothers, or ingested several Diazepam pills.
They found pills in the house and took a bit of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were rushed to the hospital "Sfânta Maria" in Iași.
They are in a stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: Our meeting that will break your heart.
At the age of 20, she received a brave gift: biological parents.
Lost in hospital in unclear condition, in the black rings of the '90s, when she was only two months old, a little girl, a girl and a newborn, and then adopted by an upper-class family in Italy, in the same year that adoption was vaguely regulated, the young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited with her biological parents in a village in Iași, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina had fulfilled these obligations for 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo decided to give their daughter a gift of courage and courage: a visit to Romania, la Iași, to learn about her past.
"Ziarul de Iași", who assisted the efforts of searching for a family of origin after a few extreme clues of vague, was a witness to these encounters that practically broke your heart.
The reporter's reporting, the emotions of the moment, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite stirring and overwhelming.
Povestea Crinei began 20 years ago in the Isheian town of Ruginoasa, when it was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, at first, there was a misunderstanding between parents, and Mother was forced to leave her home.
He decided to keep the girl, and I decided to send me home.
A oprit fata, and since then I never know anything.
"When I found out that I was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls Alina, the baby's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Paschany, and until then the girl's father, Costică Balcan, had gone to work in Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives are meant to be separated forever.
I never found her in Crina's hospital.
After the internate, Crineiro's father left to work in another locality, and he returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iași, and her father, when he returned, never found her.
I believe it had been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I even thought it was abandoned", she tells her family.
Due to financial problems, Grandma could not come with Crina la Iași, and the daughter remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was ever interested in the fate of the child during this time, it was taken over by the Directorate General of Social Welfare and Child Protection, which then gave it to the Bucium Plasmotherapy Centre.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than in Romania today.
La Centrul Bucium was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who had a dream of having a baby.
S-au fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time this would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already been pregnant for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities were in progress.
When I saw Crina, I felt like our daughter.
"De parcă soția mea i-ar fi dat vieța", says Salvadore, the adoptive father, while grabbing the girl's hands in his palm.
In the country, the parents of Crinei, Alina and Costică, continued their separate searches, each where he could.
Tatăl asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he did not receive any response where the child could be his.
The police then conveyed that it was possible that she was decedent, giving the parents the information about what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for him here, I told the Tribunal that he was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And the conditions for finding it were different than I had ever had before.
I pray to God that he is well.
I thought about it all the years ago, when we had no chance to walk, to find it.
"It's hard", she tells Crinei, with tears in her biological mother's eyes.
However, even if we look back, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explicat fetei de unde vine and that they have passed through Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
"I-I would like to meet my parents in Romania", confesses Crina cheerfully.
And the vision was to become reality.
In March of this year, chief comisarul Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevenure, Evaluation and Counselling Antidrog Iași, was contacted by a knowledgeable Italian who explained Salvadore's desire to find a biological family in Crinei.
And the searches for porn are only by one name.
After the request we had from our Italian partnership, we started our first demersuri.
We first mentioned only one name, Balcan Costică, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
For a short time I had an activity with the local municipality, and I could ask if there was a local name for the original municipality.
Then I gave some clues, only that the person found was not the one I was looking for.
"It took us a few days or months to find the biological father of the child", explains chief commissioner Romică Ichim.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costică and Alina, except that each had a domicile in a different locality.
We started the demersure sometime in March, and in June-July we finished identifying biological parents and discussing.
"The meeting is scheduled to take place in September for the first time", added Romică Ichim.
Last weekend, Alina and Costicăro saw for the first time a missing girl on the grounds of the Iași hospital, 20 years ago.
He was emotionally moved, barely able to control his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
Abroia changed a few words with those from the jur.
About a week before the date, I was unable to sleep.
He was all excited, trembling.
"To see the baby after all these years is something", says the granddaughter, who came and went with Costicá de la Ruginoasa.
Crinei's encounter with his mother and biological brother.
In discussions with his daughter, who was to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costică Balcan told her, among others, that if she ever wanted to return to the country, she should come in peace: she could give him something, hey, goat, to find a boy from the country and to settle down in the country.
My mother is so excited, crying, and hardly believes that such a thing can happen to me.
I'm very excited.
I-I didn't think that such a thing could happen.
I've watched such a bad thing on TV, I've been thinking about it for years, I'm hoping, but I never thought I could be like this.
I'm very emotional about it.
If only I could forgive you.
I hope to visit in the future.
"Hopefully we can keep the legacy", she says with tears in her eyes to Alina, Crinei's mother, as she holds a shovel in her hand.
In the meantime, he hides tears of happiness, because soon he will see his daughter after so much love.
Crina, on the other hand, who will turn 20 in just a few days, this month, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
He doesn't know what to expect, give a sketch or vague idea about his biological parents.
He thinks I'm a teenager, but right now before the meeting he tries to put his thoughts together, because he has so much to say, to blame nothing.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
My parents are ultimately the ones who care for me.
It was a wonderful encounter, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say", Crina confesses.
The first family reunion in Iași.
In the Unirii Square, under the cover of the early autumn, the Ruginoasa family once again unites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, has finished high school, according to the Italian school model, and is about to begin a new chapter with Alina and Costică, her biological parents.
Now, there are no borders or countries, but only one barrier: the border.
Peste care, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of a local in the center of Iașului, easily passed.
Those who succeeded in making this meeting possible said that this was the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, we will never face it.
This is the first event of its kind to be organized, and also an emotional one, and I am happy to be successful.
We, the Center, have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that deals exclusively with people who consume, people who depend on drugs.
We're trying to give back something good to society.
"If you are ever proud to request for such an event, you will face a sea drag", says Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Council Against Drugs Iași.
Behind him, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, split up in povestind.
I understand: the many have to spin some altora.
The PSD had a ceasefire with the foot of the gun yesterday.
Everyone is in a state of shock.
The PSD's Eastern branch has concluded an armistice with the armed forces.
After a successive round of discussions, lasting from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leadership agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
When the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, is asked to present a united position, the Social Democrats will send him or her a full list of potential candidates for the party's positions.
Rather than being over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow the fighters to take their souls.
Dragronea is now giving an ultimatum.
I have sent a very simple and very current message in the current circumstances: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3 we have a party party.
All functions will be made available to those who wish to do so.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure", said the interim prime minister, Mihai Chirica.
After two days of discussions over the weekend, I only came to the conclusion that nothing certain had been established.
The October election for the post of president of the PSD's regional branch is expected to be a bitter competition.
In the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the party's yeshiva branch are state secretary Maricel Popa, senator Florin Constantinescu, senator Sorin Lazăr, county councillor Vasile Câtea and interim president of the county council Victorel Lupu.
The municipality can also be added and the mayor of the commune of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
The other variant is the candidacy of PSD County Council Leader Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu does not run for office, party sources say.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former leader of the branch, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on the day of the election, I cannot stand for election, and no one will be surprised if that happens.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain so after October 3, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Județean Bureau and all the structures to lead us", said Catea.
Until the internal elections were held, the leadership of the PSD's regional branch was provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is on leave until September 29, however, with the preparation of the elections practically to be ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in close contact with the Nichita branch.
In a telephone call, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions over the last few days by "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the judiciary.
"On the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions regarding the candidacy for the PSD Iași presidency, the list remains open", Stanciu commented.
A yeshian judge rejected the case file of violators in Vaslui on grounds of concubine.
The seven teenage girls from Vaslui County, who were convicted of rape, are appearing today before the Court of Appeal.
Vasluiroenii sentenced to a sentence of between five years and eight months and eight years and four months before presenting their arguments on their punerea in libertate, after the court of first instance, the Judge of Vaslui, has fixed their imprisonment immediately after the sentence is pronounced.
The case file was filed with the Court of Appeals last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton filing a request to withdraw, which was accepted by his colleagues.
Anton has invoked the fact that one of the lawyers of the accused, the lawyer Bogdan Luca, is a concubinul fiicei sale, the lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends him against Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the cell that received the greatest punishment in this case.
Cum au motivat judecătorii sentința is the name given to the sentence by the judge.
In the final week of the treaty, the magistrate of the Judicature of Vaslui sentenced the seven young men to a motivated sentence.
In the motivation the judge speaks of the defiant reaction to the accused, and to those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation against public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the time of placing the restrictive measure of liberty under judicial control, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, their families and local supporters, there has been a strong sense of indignation at the level of the local and national community that persons accused of serious crimes are being tried under a less restrictive measure", the reasoning of the Judgment of Vaslui states.
Also, the magistrates at the dismissal and the main defense of the seven accused who during the process of the prosecution invoked the fact that fata pe care at the violat-o nu ar fi "usă de biserica".
"The court emphasizes that this is irrelevant to the moral quality of the victim, an aspect that the accused wishes to highlight through the defence they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext", he said in his statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe.
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity of care enjoyed in the last decade may continue in the years to come.
By Saturday, probably little people in Romania knew about Jeremy Corbyn's film.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much he can affect the happiness of a politician who is ultimately not in a position to make decisions.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader of post-war Labour.
A Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (he demanded a moment for Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocious and sympathizer to Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by Russia Today), and to the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy at the time, ISIS is almost a United States preference.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn is, of course, miraculously anti-austerity solutions.
Lucruri of the kind that Tsipras in Greece spun and promised until he was caught up in the real world and economic legitimity.
The new economic programme for the Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover some very generous social benefits.
Surely, some might ask what solution to the ban on bananas that was unanimously adopted across the globe, would then be global prosperity, and who would ever be prevented from such details.
Sure, we can tax the blood of the bankers, become a kind of service enemy to the left, as we have seen so many times in the past, not only in former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Supplementary sums are quickly swallowed up by generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagoguery.
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the problem with socialism is that the moment the money runs out".
Putin is giving Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early '80s a radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was nevertheless as extreme in his convictions as the new party leader, failed unfortunately in a plea bargain.
And then there was still in Britain a relatively consistent and structured muncitorească class, in the classical sense of the word.
And the unions were more sensitive and influential than they are now.
In the context of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the overall workforce, and extensive automation has made industry in need of massive high-skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even in opposition, he can influence important developments that cannot be directly affected.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times considers that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, or the UK's exit from the EU.
Noul, the Labour leader, has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the radical eyes of Brussels, it is an agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposes austerity on the poor.
When you combine this genre of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that has shaken the foundations of the EU, you end up with an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide to leave the Union following the referendum, which was due to take place by 2017, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep ravines created within it by the Euro crisis and now the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, will make way for the most worrying scenarios.
So much so that for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which anyway Berlin became the dominant actor).
It is true that the British business community, City-roul, are powerful advocates for the country's continued membership of the EU.
Today's Europe is not the same as it was in the past.
There is a lot of resentment, which has been growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as I have seen recently or in a speech by Jean Clude Junker, tends to make major decisions over the heads of majority states in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening in a context where electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration and eurosceptic formations is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative charge has reached the highest level ever.
De unde and concluzia that the Financial Times is concerned when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a calculation that takes into account national interests.
If the electorate makes a decision on the brain, then Britain will remain in the EU.
Corbyn's victory in the election does not remind him of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as I expected, we assist in the more pronounced integration into the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of interest and that in the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fueling their populist rhetoric from the accumulated frustrations in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic causes, the prosperity of care that has been enjoyed in recent decades, the social benefits generosity, may never continue the same in the years to come.
Under pressure from the explosion of a dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both provoked by private decisions that do not take into account the political ambitions of the integrationist, but also the capacity and willingness of the European peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, turbulence across the continent, internal tensions within the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the major situation in Romania.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the perspective of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the zeul tsar.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brâncuși: "She also wipes the atelierroul!"
The great sculptor had a great goal: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about in the world.
But behind his failure is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories, recipes for success in life, are being delivered.
Acro something has a name.
It is called "trudă".
What should I write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What may I say, actually?
The figure appears on the banknote.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brâncuși has been producing and delivering money for nearly 60 years since it was first printed.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear their names.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
Then, when he goes out with an adult, he hears the following instructions: "Mergem in park, la Brâncuși".
The East is full of salt statues.
There are few Romantic figures whose works are known to so many, children, and the elderly.
The ability to infiltrate Brâncuși is a huge one.
None of the communists have succeeded in erasing it from the memory and culture of Romania.
Today, the internet is a source of hundreds of thousands of likes and share-ours.
And, then, again, what more can I say, write about this man?
Privileged from a bunch of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family as wealthy as it is, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The life of Brâncuși is a perfect counter-example.
And maybe this is where the ar fi o cheie is.
Perhaps this is where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable they may be.
You're reading the success stories of the cretin, who are delivering you daily in newspapers and on TV.
I will carefully examine the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how a success in life, how, today, a whole world has heard of it?
It's simple.
A muncitro all his life for someone else.
Astaro did it.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, județul Gorj, the capital of the Carpathian Republic.
Este al cincilea copil al Mariei and al lui Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a family of poor peasants, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one that had to cope with his reperele care-i vor guided his artistic vision târzie.
Recalling his childhood and the madness in which he grew up, the artist was to confess, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, de la Paris, in 1933: "Life was beautiful and harmonious then".
From milleniums, people were ducal, happy, or patriarchal.
Totul is the third line of the un antimp altul.
And do you know what's going to change things?
The civilization of the ancient world has come down to us.
Copilroía lui Brâncuși, however, was far from an idyllic tale.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that will characterize the future sculptor and those spent in his native locality.
The momentum was reproduced in the lucrative work "Brâncuși. O biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuroși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the "cazan" was being made, watching those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brâncuși caught a moment of general neatness.
He filled the palm tree with a spoon and a beef and a snack.
Croade falls asleep almost instantly.
The first human observers don't see anything until after a few minutes.
Mother panicked, then became hysterical, believing her son was dead.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the life of a laughter, he sees from afar signs of dispersion or those who are waiting with their souls for the gharana.
Petrecerea is immediately transformed into a yellow.
Tatroăl is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brândușa, a doctor and servant of Brâncușilor.
The branding checks the baby's breathing, then puts a large ball of lime under his nose, collected from the front.
The strangest copilul is powerful.
Lumroea applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on the bed, the party with the laughter continues with even greater force.
The next day, the father and son met in the living room.
Radu Brâncuși asked Constantine to gather some Christmas presents and bring them to him.
The father lifts the child upside down and, with the child's head down, beats him to remember.
And, while feeling the consternation of the ravages, Michael Brâncuși is the revelation that the world can be privatised from another perspective and that things in the world can turn upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit old age, if the astral self is not involved in the turmoil.
Would he have been as confused as his father about what happened?
At the moment, the oracle is not working.
A parliamentarian appealed to politicians to remember who voted.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț has appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a sea of debunars and so on.
I have not seen anything from the USL project of 2012 that continues.
Neither the highway, nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians are disputing their possible accommodations based on real estate interests.
Let's leave a little political deopart, let's get together and talk.
At the moment, the oracle is not working.
"If you are busy with internal warfare, you never have time for those who care for you", Blăjuț declared.
He noted that the current political class decimated the IESE electorate, resulting in a very low presence of local electorates, at around 30%, representing practically a partisan electorate.
The deputy also considers that the electorate is now oriented towards the spread of traditional parties, expressing reservations about the new political initiative, such as the party "Pentru Iași" that will be launched today.
The local party has very little chance and no chance of winning the electorate, no chance of losing the PSD.
Astro party astro is based on civic activists, who are usually on the right.
"It's breaking even more right, which is not good for anyone, not even for PSD", Blăjuț said.
He has made clear that he is not interested in running for the next local election, denying rumors about his intention to run for the Primary.
I've already said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am always thinking about whether to continue as a deputy in my future term.
I tried to appeal the unit for Iași and in the pe holuri discussions with the other parliamentarians, and was accused of trying to make up my mind.
I don't want to, but we can never go on like this.
"If people don't vote, it doesn't mean they're smart enough not to vote if they don't see anything", said Blăjuț, who said the main reason why the electorate isn't interested in politics is the hypocrite bias of the electorate.
A colleague from Tătărași said that he didn't have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be a hypocritical movie.
Now they are a little money.
Sometimes I feel embarrassed to take the money from the vault.
At the end of his term, he will report on all his expenses, in addition to the salaries of the cabinet employees and their maintenance.
I happened to be ridiculed in a month and 30,000 laws, with all the transportation, cazar and celebratory accounts.
"To tell a parliamentarian that I don't have enough money and hypocrisy", Blăjuț concluded.
