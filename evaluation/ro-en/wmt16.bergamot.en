UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has been going on for nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief has again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday during a conference call that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to strike a deal on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll figures showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others have called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to tear down Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a double-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously ask what this means for the marriage mogul’s chances of being appointed.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's lead was making way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons for fighting hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative economic club for Growth admit Trump's power and begin supporting him with money.
Below we present some figures from recent surveys suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something fleeting:
Figures pointing to support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had climbed to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were to win the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% says they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
The majority of Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his bombing insults and his bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where also 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, asking who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full briefing: in the past, GOP voters didn't read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, versus just 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider the Trump campaign plausible.
Even if Republicans or retreasoned to another candidate. Trump is still at the head of everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and the majority of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points clear of Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and, ultimately, 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost on a par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most Donald Trump's supporters say they have decided.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the loophole open for the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "rapporteur" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus in the 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and prejudice efforts to rebrand.
But according to the ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards the authorities is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of congressional Republicans, with 54% declaring themselves "disgruntled" and 21 percent "nervous at the pinch."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Ministry's Questions
Still since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has long been awaited
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Ministry's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after noon; his performance will likely be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could give up a few attendances and cede them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after appointing a "ghost booty" and after the speech he gave on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to keep quiet at the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England has drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem caught the attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept silenced respectfully" and acknowledged the "heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's phantom cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended that the Labour leader play the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet have refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and foreign, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences "cumulate" in Labour after Mr Corbyn's appointment of his stance on his position on the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour would make changes to the full idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was "very clear" in the exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron at the stands before, since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "from foreign sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said the PMQs involved too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from replies and attacks, pledging to instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Cornn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would hold his place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak out on the occasion, saying he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with the PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his approach.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and that he needs deep reformation.
"Frames in Joburg": Homeless Youths Get Photo Courses
It's difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and gain their lives.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News has met with one of the project's first graduates.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could harm enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power will exceed the higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, in the view of Tennis President Steve Heally.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unspoiled into the spotlight by the scandalous skids Kyrgios had towards Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: “Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down.”
Although he was last seen making a dusty missile after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadily defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn a bit into the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a racket when he lost because he blamed the US cramps, but he is not the first player to break a racket out of frustration than himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of that.
But let's be serious, he's mastered himself extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family alongside and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has not had any conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the long-term player from Canberra in the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think at all about the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matures under the public’s eyes and made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his deeds and I think he needs a time when he is not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders cut half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will back.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their election than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
Support among men has reduced considerably and Sanders is just 5 points away.
The advantage of Clinton among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on a par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at an advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of Democratic national voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first ranked, Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the proper experience (16 percent), followed by the time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice-president is considering a possible presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believe he shouldn't run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters mostly appoint Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be the second option, much ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the best candidate to win the general election; but the numbers dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place but the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
As last month, no Democratic or candidate candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable to the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of some key features towards their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be upright and trustworthy and having solid qualities of leaders.
Biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don't think H. Clinton is integral and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the Democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist over Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server while Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are happy with her explanation of the subject and say she didn’t affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy did not affect their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their minds in a negative sense.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their views on Clinton in a negative sense.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton upright and trustworthy, this continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32 percent consider her upright and trustworthy, 8% fewer than last month and 15 percent fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integral and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of national voters do not consider Trump to be trustworthy and worthy of confidence.
Yet both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sansers into the world is higher than those who do not agree, but as in Carson’s case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with murder of student in year 1 of Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Popo Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put in his back a 14kg backpack full of sand and was repeatedly bullied while trying to head to a target, on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng blamed headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claims he would have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng’s clothes, search for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the nationwide fraternity president, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals of brotherhood, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended that the top five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and aiding and abetting murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch Faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew his affiliation with the local dealership.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (growing market) will stumbling, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few clues to time-frame.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
Federal Reserve's aggression to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have so sharply stressed that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise, but on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at stake.
But in the end, market players could find that all the excitement about raising the interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first interest rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money,"" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels, but still low will constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it can’t be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate growth can volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for capital return to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the downward in monetary policy again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increases.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards rising interest rates, quite invariably in the 250-day period after (average ascent of 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average recovery in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tended to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but interest rate increases often contribute to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low point for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a growing decision from the Fed, with all eyes being on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at this meeting, term trading indicates a probability of just 25 percent.
“In our study conducted after 1950, all the cycles of interest rate growth to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing its peaks before the recession very rapidly after the recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile considering that the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of equities when the Fed changes the policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease from the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, the return on bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will cause the closeness of the profitability between short- and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-profit bonds do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, a fixed-income analyst, said in a calculation.
Interestingly, Jones is of the view that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and declining estimated inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the curve of profitability is more just, the average interest rate spread has widened and volatility has increased - all market features when the Fed tightens politics.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mostly in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debt will suffer because the rise of the dollar will increase their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues and low-fat incomes also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the rise in the dollar.
Those who save might also benefit, though experts don't agree on how quickly this happens.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slams radio station for 'stupid'
It states it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took to the eye of the BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiarized the Brits awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying this show isn't original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, a major MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove he is doing something that commercial stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that public radio "stupid" and increasingly resembled the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 “stupid” – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
It also took to the eye of the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general has denied the allegations, saying the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent over live music and educating the public.
I won't find out anywhere about classical music what I find out from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important Radio 3’s commitment to discover new music and allocate new songs,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract audiences from the previous period because Britons have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised in the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of around £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be made "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find the golden egg hen in its own yard" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban in the future the takeover of new seasons in The Voice or spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales saw the smallest increase in August and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, there has been the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales gained momentum three years ago, thanks to the use of your mobile phone to shop.
Specialists believe that November Black Friday could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned commercial streets in the UK into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are reducing, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest increase since 2000, with an increase of just 5 per cent in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend of rationing over time," Andy Mulcahy, an IMRG sales index editor, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, the number of people who could shop online and could do it in various circumstances, such as from the sofa.
But now that it is stagnating a little, you may notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to computers to get their hands on the deals, leading to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers fought on bargains, could determine the reluctance of shoppers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After Bin Laden's sanction, Muslims bury victims killed in Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for its collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the collapse of the crane
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those mourning their dead joined along the way to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction attenuation collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
Bodies have been released for the funeral after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 people injured.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane collapse at the sea mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the crane up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi News Agency, said the Binla group in was partly bearing the blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not outline the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane's collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failed to coordinate its work with weather authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has been in close relationship with the Saudi royal family and has been running major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegat" son, disinherited from the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every Muslim physically apt.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi Rials (£174,000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of that amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
On the banking market there have already appeared two offers for the conversion in lei of loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just concluded the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data accumulated by the analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate at lei, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Banca Transilvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to the second successive discounts: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk fees and administration paid by the customer, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the coming years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the pretsiege in lei of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from the future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which the salary collects.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the revaluation of the property is not made, no additional guarantees are required and another proof of revenue.
Basically, no new financial and legal analysis of the credit will be made, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discount on the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of the interest, and the customer reimburses very little from the principal.
Bancpost's offer with very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so on the total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest, the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may occur, not mentioned in the initial offer.
Time for interest rate decisions for US Federal Reserve
The world is looking at its scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half that last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will last for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop its zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities who have lost their charm
The (left) actor, along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor may have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this has a cost for sure.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United sits on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ending with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and will hold him on the stand for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV defence.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he encounters difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
His oxygen mask was placed in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno reportedly got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it's a foul and red card.
It was a very bad, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I'm starting the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England team defender has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never track to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Netherlands-led van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I was only able to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I'm feeling very bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also ended up in hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but still holds loud
The victory against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, however, having seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of defeat with 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the option of an away win either.
Maybe Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago, but they have good players in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude youthful.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth into the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that the cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that previously - the players are their own selectors.
For fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runes for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not matching his ability and I'm not surprised by that; first of all, he's a team man.
It is hard to answer the question in how long a batsman is noted in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runes - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and away.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top shape - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman that I quote very well.
He is a cricket player who has the "X factor" and who we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
At least the same opportunity should be given to those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
It was launched the idea of Moeen opening up with Cook, which would lead the extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proved he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old team-mate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches as first drop before he went in open in 2001.
He immediately wiped three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, he struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his young age - with an average of 31 at the beating and 35 to the ball - and they might think it's bridge, but there are no pile of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tournament.
England have also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the tournament's white-ball leg and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I've always believed he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes is resting for day-after matches, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although they don't all agree, coaches and selectors don't do the schedule.
And you have to keep in mind, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken easy.
Brexit camp could win if the economy keeps calm until 2017
By the day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting louder and lurking, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have characters like Cornn and Nigel Farages.
One European diplomat explained the other day that - immersed in crises similar to that in the EU - not all of which are domestically provoked - some member states are fuelled with the UK agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they do not want this either if they would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor are taking part in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, taking a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then returning home and say they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with a perspective outwards under the roof of the EU - "Don't leave us alone with France," declares Berlin - suggests that several ministers and obtuse officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the highly cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation faltered, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left-wing.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentionally remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain has not achieved anything of value from renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin how gripping Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons who look at the EU are skeptical because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn which ratified our 1973 entry in report 2:1.
Maybe they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 90s when he was a correspondent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-paying tax pounds, foreigners who were defrauding by phone and pseudo-non-domes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating at lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who hit me back on his back on Monday at Westminster - I told him to stop spending time with me - he seems to be in danger of adopting from a son Neil Kinnock's Chrisnock's 80s boycott strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call indulgence in evolution.
It says it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism" could agree with that.
That's what Hilary "Un Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfair to his labours' fellow lagoers, without going too far and without losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said, nor with what JC told his colleagues and lawmakers at the private meeting on Monday night.
No matter what image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he also sensitized me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to be given Cameron a ticket of favour in Europe, allowing him to take the support of Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's core sophism about EU membership - consistent with their anti-capitalist past - no longer just constitute an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is unwavering that the JC will not campaign for quitting - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the UK when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise England's Public Health Department's decision on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, a government agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team have joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
A few researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and substantiating them "on solid ground or on quicksand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said they expect PHE's claims that "current estimates show e-cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-crudicial decision-analyzing model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or claimed one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that there are reports that he received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on which the panel members were selected, but among them are some “fruntals” known in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even declare the industry’s financing.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of PEHE.
The group's research paper "convincingly muddles" that "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "until now there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health at PHE's health department, says the BMJ claims have been answered in the past.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes for health are minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that do not show up from the evidence, in particular, in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs borne by the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they only pose a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Ads disabling Britain's arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Horrific killer drones!
Beasts for the crushing of the ankles!
Dysperio bombs!
And electric sticks that cause horrendous pain without leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and the animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fierce charade, made by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell weapons to repressive regimes via Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian regimes arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and in metros that need a second look.
"Isan announcement, you're travelling with DLR between September 15 and 18?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the end of the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum, in Dismaland, Banksy.
A grouping called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using the “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a £6-gink package Allen that says it “facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stops on the planet.”
The London transport company is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and seeking to make political work accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are turning to working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to go out into the real world in order for their art to impact society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters running by subway.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever was shocked by the silence surrounding the advert for the arms fair - with a gaping space on the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic commercial, but “in enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more striking.”
“They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab leaked an order received from the U.S. military on "AT4CS RS with a backlit launcher."
This includes “a single-form warhead that provides breathtaking effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved to the dorm, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I was annoyed – and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving in the home can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to dread.
The chatter is tempting: telling people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of rest from studying, what you think about Corn and why “since, Marmite is indifferent because, for good boys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deeply.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn’t talk to even if the potople came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinks, movie nights and socializing meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.
Similar topics: Don't even think about starting your student life in a relationship
Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many dormitories a bedroom-based, friendship, socialization and lifelong friends are built in many dormitories.
All this can be terrible for someone who tries to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I’ve spent interacting with you.”
Try to seize when a colleague is exhausted by socializing - and try to send an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same dorm as me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked up, then he was invited to go in.
He's seen enough things.
Make friends by cooking.
Since you start the university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone’s door to get acquainted and carry a saucer with brownies, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 50’s, “Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions.”
Goodness in the home is a great way to make friends.
Your co-workers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a skilled cook.
The luteras of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when knocking on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Obviously, if you swipe someone's chicken is theft, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea it's still theft?
Ask the owner.
He will probably tell you to serve yourself even if he boils inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to tackle the problem more mature than my fellow dormant, who coloured his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
Now he's in jail.
Don’t make noise that doesn’t let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, but because you're literally going on shards.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to turn off the music because it was 3 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to turn the music up.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and left them to sleep two hours before giving the most of the music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/future wife moved to the same level?
On the contrary, it wouldn’t be extremely strange if you confused a colleague of the party with your future husband, you would hook up, you would part and you should meet daily and maybe even see him take over all the common friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy palette is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in the locked room, the line between the prank and the intimidation is finer than it looks.
A successful prank is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
Lean a funny and valuable lesson related to safety by hiding something - but never smear someone's camera with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick someone's belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In the age of Bach there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, downright "weird", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it at least a curiosity in the landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unmissable.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of performing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, and not of composers.
They are formed as "specialized workers."
They think they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, is doing marketing.
Therefore, we are not talking about music.
So, if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but it has to look at, which is stupid again," said David Grimal.
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical receptions" of his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So, I couldn't find any sense of continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one was doing that without a conductor: “The musical world, extremely conservative, didn’t want such projects.”
"How do I imagine you marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no more ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Less Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," Grimal argues, adding that at the Sunday show "there were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is “very brave”, precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present, which plays 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group”.
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu’s music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, “because there is also a George Enescu who made French music”.
Grimal advocates the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the craftsmanship of musician, as it is organized today, has a sense of death" and that "the future of music represents the music itself".
We don't need to tour the world 5 times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
In the age of Bach there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, album release, are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and post-accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens to music, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should be back in the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done from the educational policy.
“If we considered – as Koreans do, the Chinese, the Japanese – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist during the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized within the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the hottest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the "3D Snow Queen" superproduction
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to become a star.
In September, during the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voci", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If the classic drawings emphasized the approach of the actor’s voice to the specifics of the animated character, lately, when creating the story, those who are going to play the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a unique campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection following which will be chosen 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents need to do is access the platform littleevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Subsequently, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record by interpreting his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose contestants to support the challenge: "3D Yellows," "Moune: Guardian of the moon 3D," "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D mischievous" and "The Mayan 3D Bee."
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, lower tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing profit forecasts for all year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Shares of the company fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts were predicting the $10.84 figure, according to a factSet poll.
The downward estimate comes despite price rises by 4.9 per cent on average, with entry into force on January 4 and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy-weight packages that will apply from November.
The company said it still expects to increase earnings from the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
Job plans over the holiday period were announced one day after competitor UPS said plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of hirings he made last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profits rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, leading to stagnation in revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has picked up the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw revenue growth due to higher base tariffs, while revenues recorded by the freight division fell due to rising costs.
When pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, at the close they fell 11% year-on-year and 17 percent from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Mahonhono table to decide whether it was time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank's meeting room, a U.S. mural will be glimpsed.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed President, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank was given a double burden from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be stripped of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place from the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data points to a strong growing economy, the recent stir in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious of adding volatility by increasing the benchmark to federal funds - even by a quarter of a percentage point alone.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think that if they were to look for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will make, it itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated an increase in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30 percent.
That would indicate a fall on the stock exchange if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow promising that it would take a long time to go down to the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
The momentum was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers did this, "it would have to act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty over when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to be on the verge of 0.25 percent this month, the first small step towards slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate hike this year despite high objections by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued not to reach the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers claimed a key reason was the temporary effect of the sharply falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the labor market tension," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began going into fibrillation later this month after China devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones fell 16 percent below the record high reached in May as investors feared the slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down world growth.
The market has somewhat recoiled this month, with the Dow now being about 10 percent below the May high.
For Fed decision makers, the hustle and bustle in the market adds to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate rise.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and news of weakening the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be firmer at the meeting,” Stephen D said. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he expects at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty that the impact on the U.S. economy will be and they almost don’t have data on which to be based on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should not be considered in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
The mere allusion of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm Evestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to the economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that advocated the interest rate rise, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75 percent in three meetings, "despitating the implications with the possibility of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials backtracked on those declines.
The Fed should only pose the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, Adam S said. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last hectic period does not rise to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to end up fearing an interest rate hike because markets have been upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something changes in this regard, I don't think it should take action prematurely.
Looking for a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/open/open warehouse in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/deposit is a universal type shop that offers a breathtaking array of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, Thai and Asian folk snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a car district where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and at least an hour is required to go through all the aisles.
If you get hungry from so much bought, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food district (good, affordable in price) is close to homes and offers several options of dishes that can be taken in.
What does it have in stock: Need anything - anything- Thai?
You probably find at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and certain items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat district is large, and so is the fish district - the staff serving will clean and thread the fish and even fry it if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find curry leaves, melon and frozen ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and boss chefs, also families and individuals.
On the wide aisles fit both shopping carts and fork carts.
Discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the area of the houses.
Whereabouts: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own common parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although chances are that the store will crowd, it is usually not difficult to find a parking space.
Seven's Sunise dominates polls despite attempts by Nine channel to stream in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent displacement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes at the helm of the Liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning show of the Nine channel broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The contestant Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over the course of weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruze" of distance did not appear to matter much to the audience Aussie TV, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, versus Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's audiences (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has shrunk the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only the Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main story was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series star starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having as subject a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to cope with a show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night responded resoundingly that "yes."
The Seven-show X Factor held in position with 1.136 million viewers, taking slightly face the shows The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second evening shestreamed The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show moderated had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 528,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in audiences recorded by Chase Australia on the second evening will give tacit confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Sibera.
As he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized and his pro-deocratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group state that the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally governmented country for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the constitution bill and officials said the new charter could be passed on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The prime minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with weapons.
"It is a disgrace for Europe century 21 to apply methods from the 30's," said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday."
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide-ranging low-pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands is likely to turn into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front roughly at half-distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also show a 60 percent probability of a tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, the Miami-based meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful in mild-obese diabetics
The benefits of weight-reducing surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could hold for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to tell if diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those undergoing nonsurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight measurement in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the close data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the sleeve - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
Average BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes mellitus was completely cured in 36% and partly in 28 percent.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus was completely cured at only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved “gluemic control” – reflected by improved hemoglobin levels A1c – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief scientist Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the sleeve, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more considerable decreases in BMI (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavyweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," without increasing risk of death or kidney disease, she states.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely hard to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued an appeal to end the violence in the refugee's mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the issue of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of the countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis is inappropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to worry about a few thousand refugees, but we must think at the same time of long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these issues," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the violent response from the U.S. generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgian Anti-Diighting Center, U.S. anti-poison centers reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Anti-Poiling Center, cases of hand-held detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-poison centers climbed from 3.266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others are doing it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
On YouTube can be watched movies that show teenagers how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that the teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand detergent) are scented ones.
Hand detergents with strawberry, grape, orange are most attractive to children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand detergent sprays, has reached the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was swooping and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored it overnight in a children's hospital separately to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchy said.
"It was terrifying," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet wipes and stop leaving hand detergent out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol ethyl, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade schoolchildren in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher “putting antibacterial products into the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in his classroom.
Police felt the plan was "miswing" and put forward the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

Griffiths dismantles rumours of misunderstanding
Rumors of disagreements have emerged at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to confront Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players can't wait.
The absence of Scots in the race for the title bores the Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronaldo de Boer said the Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not battling for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently ambassador of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer convey the summary of the Celtic matches; why?"
Because there's not the Rangers there.
Here, there is not just talk about the return of Rangers.
There is talk of Old Firm.
There is talk of both teams together and that is where the interest is headed.
Tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it's not just the Scots want to see those matches.
I will change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was struggling hard but the Norwegian boss vowed to change the situation.
The defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat to Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now at the top of the rankings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “Celtic have had periods ahead and will recover.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
The same is the same for us - but we have to move on.
We absolutely need the support of Celtic because the players get better.
It is extremely important to remain united now.
Warburton's caution on January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified some goals for January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn't want to affect the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer period is very different from the one in the summer."
In the case of the players transferred in the summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, something you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players who aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after retiring
Swansea's Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfers period, suggested he could withdraw on his contract with Swans expire.
The 29-year-old player struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts face SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled out in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't need to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I'm playing for the Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits the Aberdeen team must desperately hold on to Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh successive league victory, which earned them five points ahead of Celtic thanks to the first-half penalty kick executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won something, in the cup or league, and that has not won matches like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as UK rises
The RISE's RISE in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of unemployed in the UK overall rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in the UK, of 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK's €73.5 average.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term authorities' plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate registering growth and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm a Witnessing Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because usually requests go beyond the number of available seats, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for representatives in the press from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stand by Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I've developed my own connection with him throughout the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tells the story of the inmate as he wants, he gets access.
I complained about it.
He admitted that “it could have formulated better”, but he still believes that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write and I wouldn’t do it if he asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series we have made.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is like to look at a man whom I like dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to pull out of races
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from racing.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive test result for Cobalt by Lidari, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about spy statements and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes."
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that, and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly goes wrong,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have declared.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go head-on and I want the owners I collaborate with see that I'm trying to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up the coaching profession.
At that point I'm going to have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eight months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I'll tell if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously they consider me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, CEO of RVL, knew at the time and still know today.
Should I believe it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can account for people outside the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is that so bad my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how the others see.
Maybe he has to take my license and push me aside and I have no doubts that the statements I make now could make them think about this option.
But I got to the point where I don’t care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with the long-running investigation into the cobalt testing involving Lidari and the removal led him to state that he could "put his licence on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labeled the race-day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay catappear on the horses' feet, which breaks the rules.
Break the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which has happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasma, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver who hit and fled crash site in Cobram arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the end of the week followed by fleeing the scene of the crash.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, having been seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to police in Sheparton.
He is reportedly charged with fleeing the scene of the crash, with no first aid and other road traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the tackle tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" raised by the top two NRL favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to "take them to slam" their team in Storm's nervously won match in the qualifying final played on Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night when he called that match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of the cladding tactics approached by his team and said the players were simply focusing on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, meaning they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop there - we didn't hear Train Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, only in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in the clatters and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and he obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and it's been a shock to him.
We know how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football," reminding Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons mentor won the league in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his mind by comparing his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and talked about how thrilling the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he doesn't care how much black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be a thrilling football, especially thanks to young rapid midfielders.
That kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when they were thinking about the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a fiercer race related to the score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, we haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean thrilling game?
Or exciting means to take breaks and not score?
For me there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the final of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used little girls' phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile was using the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone when she was asleep and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images of children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
He looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
After arrival, police saw the five pictures then analysed computers found at the address and found "worrying" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children's subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "to claim he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the computer searches, but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a policeman to scare off the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and the fact that he asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to lure it.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called out her mother and was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on her phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and recounted that the accused was using the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, June 14, 23-year-old Hogg, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had taken indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the conditions of parole on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offenders register because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."
Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but remained in custody before the appearances for other files.
It was passed on the register of sex offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivers wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, however, the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed he had received anonymous death threats, threatening them lest he boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on mobile phones, warning not to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is titled ‘death,’” he told journalists after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
He warns the lawmakers concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the services sector.
This year. HP will split on the stock exchange in two companies, separating its computer and printer division from operations with corporate hardware and fulsome services.
The expected layoffs will bring about $2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustaining structure," said Meg Whitman, HP's president and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the break-up.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will hold a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business development,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers worldwide.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
It splits a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the object of the activity of producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Leaga Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move taken by HP, the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in 20-45 years of age in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In trying to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students who were experiencing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood”, his chances of recovery double.
Equally, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediateness of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if it is in reality it is the dominion.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that he turned attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in comfortable chairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from completely exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ..."my role of listening to people with a suicidal and depressed tendency showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who turn to us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to fend for yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to provide more mechanisms of long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention helps through the phone, people who arrive in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you are attending this weekend at Comedy Central’s FriendsFest, with the complete rendering of the film sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG set aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut match and helped PSG stand up to Sweden's Malmo.
Below we present the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group stage series, with a soothing 2-0 win against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes since the start of her debut match in the PSG team's Champions, bringing France's champions to the advantage although they missed a number of chances before securing their advantage with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify for the best, but also an improvement in the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc’s students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win is causing problems for our opponents and setting a comfortable difference from the next ranked, even though there are still aspects that we still have to perfect throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we didn't manage to give one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw obtained at home by Bordeaux in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated that when he gushed at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before kicking incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner on the right goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to get the win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national title holders with a defence out of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdich's kicker that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, giving some unnecessary steps and not finalising the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts only in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani just after the resumption of the game.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his team-mates, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot deflected by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the end after an hour of the match leaked thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic stepped from Maxwell's cross.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop of Wiland from distance for the rejection of David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi canceled a goal in extra time.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later claimed that PSG were one class above and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the Sweden league, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock market prices, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broadly massive debt reduction plan.
The London-based Glencore company said it had sold £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57 percent of its market value this year, the company is slamming down prices on the commodities exchange, because China's fall in economic activity is influencing demand and is causing disaster in the markets.
The preferential remittance of subscription has increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning's trades.
Shares climbed 2.77 per cent to 131.60s andings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore has unveiled the $2.5 billion sale of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30bn in debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4 percent less than Tuesday's closing price.
It took out 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices, by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy must open up more widely to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China needs to commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opener policies," Xi said during the 16th Meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the Continuation of General Reforms.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring a new impetus and vitality and give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative market access regulation list, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the residence registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legislation-based business environment and providing wider openness to the market.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services.”
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green kernels", optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practice lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with Government's proposal to increase salaries by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the trade unions in Education have not reached any results, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from December 1, with payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, from November, or one of 20%, from December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labor, Rovana Plumb.
Today’s Government proposal did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have ended up in the situation to convene the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent promised to us today is less for us than what we expect.
“Actually, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year, for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, President of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by the representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the salary increase, and the unionists will decide if they accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Salary Law to Parliament as soon as possible, so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase provided in the document to be escheduled in the next four years.
Also, Victor Ponta promised the trade unionists the full payment of the 2016 court sentences.
Migrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat they were in swayed.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coastguard said it had managed to rescue 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it ransacked.
The route has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape war and heavy life in countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 stewards and stewardesses because they are overweight, the company said late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridic" and "soughtful of sexist," The Washington Post reports.
Mass slab is the latest in a decade-old fight between the company and fuller stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 80’s, when Air India started using graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine stewardesses deemed "exceptionally overweight" as this "may have an effect on reflexes and can impede the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures."
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed," a company spokesman explained.
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision did he make
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali in terms of promoting young players.
If the financier of the champion decided to close the Football Academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, the desolations in the locality being expected at a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to kick off the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having material worries in training.
They have to take one care: to play football as well as possible.
Technical details should not be their concern.
They have to put their talent in value.
This is what the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy does.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar in the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," the Papp footballer told dejeanul.ro.
At the Academy of Stars, children up to 11 years old are expected.
The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize by a congressional decision, we will do this too.
There won't be any emotion about that.
“There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone the uncertainty of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister,” Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD’s National Standing Bureau.
PSD announced when it will make congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message will be given if the government is wanted to continue or whether the party decides to pass into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for a position at the Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will weigh on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also settled.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD National Standing Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy has to do with his file, Dragnea said that he does not have this problem.
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to me all my colleagues in the party to announce or not an application at the moment when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed the extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the Executive Committee of the party.

Italian man caught at Bors customs with migrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankan nationals were detected at Bors customs on Monday while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of a truck driven by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigation, it was determined that the two had paid the driver for 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police informs.
At the specific control, the border guards noticed, in the cab of the truck, a large travel bag, in which there were personal things for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough control over the means of transport.
On this occasion, the border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic boxes, two male persons.
It has emerged from the checks that the persons in question, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
"Upon research, the young people said they intended to reach France, which is why they contacted a countryman, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person," the Border Police said in a statement.
The two migrants were drawn up "criminal work in terms of committing the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border."
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum car, registered in Romania, carrying plastic boxes for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for pre-trial detention.
How satisfied are the Romans in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the coming to Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they are 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of the couple relationship.
“However, 18% are shown to be ‘easy unmet’ and ‘very unsatisfied’ in the couple’ relationship, and another 18 percent said,’” the study said in a statement on Tuesday.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unmet and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unmet, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state (suitable), we see a difference of two percent.
“The same in the very unsatisfactory situation, the biggest difference being to the slightly unsatisfactory answer where we see a difference of 6 percent,” the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less time together, with 18 percent spending five to eight hours together, and 45 percent between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that “Romanians feel a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%”.
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1 on 1,369 people, the calculated margin of error being 2.6%.
Europe has been ashamed of itself once again
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "has shamed" after Monday's failure of the ministerial meeting in Brussels on the allocation of refugees within the European Union.
"Last night (Monday night), Europe has once again been embarrassed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, told a news conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting European Union structural funds to countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migratory crises in Europe since 1945.

What's going on with coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, she has to choose whether or not she will continue to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the novel only at the important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise at Cahill, who seems the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the whimsical athlete.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether he will offer a consistent contract to Cahill or if he will give up the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis, he is requesting a contract of about one million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not like to give up at the moment.
The last race that Simona and Cahill will work together is the Tournament of Champions in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last autumn.
The former selector confessed that he did not get along with FRF President Razvan Burleanu, after he took Mircea Sandu’s place, and thus took the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary in order to stay, but he was refused.
At this point I'm not sorry I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, I'd leave a work behind.
That’s how I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a selector, it wasn’t normal, I wasn’t respected, my work wasn’t respected.
I worked well with those before from the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn’t know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably the ideas had changed too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he really wanted me to stay, I proposed them a contract increase.
We have about 400 and something thousands of euros per year, I was going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right-hand man.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to coach in Saudi Arabia, immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Arch-toranding and water cannon at the border
Hungarian police detached Humove military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia after violent clashes during Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to keep from Serbia, despite Hungary erecting a fence with barbed wire.
At least 20 police and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will remake the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas crowds who throw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and were able to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that even the Serbs supplemented their law enforcement at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the border crossings at Roszke-Horgs for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to stem the access of migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia, he will also raise one on the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence and on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
Nick Hess was suspected by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely keep on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he didn’t drink alcohol, it was apparent that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
“But friends and family thought he was ‘maybe drinking on his own, he’s a secret alcoholic.’”
When he saw his wife's footage of him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, just didn't recognize himself: "I was looking me in the eye and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick most thought was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcohol level three times over legal, although the night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, Nick has been found to suffer from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease does not have a cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick has not had such episodes.
He smashed a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man has destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip ended up on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed the car had faults that endanger his life and the life of his family.
His annoyance arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Current Year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of the efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on the national territory," according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unitary management and coherence of the situations determined by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens coming from states with a potential migrationist or who can affect national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the stay of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: the facilitation of access to third-party citizens who meet the employment needs of the third party, the favoring the access of third-country nationals to the higher education institutions in Romania for the fields and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the Action Plan for 2015, the Government considers that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the increase in the total labour cost among the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year, compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index relates to employer staff expenses.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labor increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU in increasing the cost of labour
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU states where the hourly cost of labour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labor in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of another workforce.
Activity report of TVR leadership rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risked dismissal
The Culture Committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
For the rejection of the report voted 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the Joint Standing Bureaus.
They will decide, probably next week.
At the next plenary meeting, it will be debated.
"I think that in view of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Committee Chairman Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR management should also be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense to present the TVR leadership because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the members of the Board of Directors last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Joint Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the management of TVR inviting it.
I believe that when you are summoned, you being a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint committees even if you do not like you.
"Because it's your obligation to service, you're in an institution under the subordination of Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Joint Culture Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the meeting based on the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
We saw the debts as they continued, the idea came up with the idea that this year they would have been up to date, but they did not get paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not that it is not the fault of me or someone else in these committees that the leisure with the banks and the tax office, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles won't be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand in the queue here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenum of the Parliament, through their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - common sense in his attitude towards the employees because he is a pile of petitions coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
“When you receive such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” concluded the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee.
Although he did not appear at the Parliament, the President-General of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that the Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of the public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV tax, amending and supplementing GD 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of up-to-date technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on control in the field of paying the TV tax and finding the contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that would provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become trustees of SRTv for collecting the TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum 5% ceiling of the commission from the receipts.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of the law 41/1994, in the sense of being able to receive budget/funding allowances for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will default in the coming months, given that the labor legislation obliges the employer to execute the court decisions, even if they are not final, and the salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce the expenses of staff and TV production.
"Thus were reduced the trips and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News was closed," reads the letter of the TVR president.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by its own efforts alone.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later find itself unable to fulfill its public mission," the letter reads.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Vasile Blaga's son-insurgeons sent to court
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damage of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded in custody on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after marrying Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to evade taxes and fees to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
“In fact, in the company’s accounting would have been recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus prejudiced by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheikhs have established the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheiks of the Al-Ittihad club have established the fate of mid-small Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press reports that Sanmartean’s separation from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the match holder and does it well.
The sheiks realized and they like him is the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
It would have been the option to bring in another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There were several discussions, like the one with the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu voted vice-president at the Court of Accounts
The plenary of the Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones to vote against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
In fact, the Liberals criticized Sarbu’s appointment in this position and announced that they will challenge it at the CCR, given that he has a file at the DNA, but he does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position from the Court of Accounts does not allow him to make politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the movie "Burnt," the actor made a revelation that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, to continue in the same way.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so his entire childhood cooked with his Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reports.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map at all," he said.
“I have dreams, things you would laugh if I told you,” he said, but said, adding that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, however, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who also took up directing at this age.
Ponta accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday morning condemned the statements of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that political decision-makers in Hungary are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, offends the entire Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania's domestic politics," the head of the Hungarian diplomacy added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from some Hungarian government representatives.
“These are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in the anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis!”
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem – they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee!
“I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values – what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!”, the head of the Romanian executive stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called as "simple lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, saying the statements were unsuitable for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The Hungarian foreign minister also mentioned on Tuesday that the “extreme and lying remarks” of the Romanian prime minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and am saying is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with beating and with the insertion.
"That's what I don't agree with," the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to start preparing the field for the expansion on the border with Romania of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Subsequently, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary’s decision to erect a fence on the borders does not solve anything on the refugee problem and “take Hungary out of Europe”.
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane
Saudi authorities have announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden’s family, is “partially responsible” for the crash of a crane on Friday on the Sea Mosque in Mecca, which killed 107 people.
According to an investigative commission, the company did not "respect safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reports.
Company executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in the case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terror network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosques, in order to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident happened on Friday evening during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque at Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the mouth of the contestants
Considered by many people the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retiring, as a poor coach, who cannot be able to achieve performances in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he patronizes.
After a year of taking over the team, the King has shown that he is able to turn a team struggling to save from relegation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance is one of a top team, fighting at European cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team reached the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (on a par with Astra), more than double than the Stars.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team several experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting youngsters, and lately in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club’s policy has made the Future a team to watch for the foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer 1.5 million euros – Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina – 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bars – 500 thousand euros).
Along with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played like a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
The big countries come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the Board of Directors of the Romanian European Policy Center.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea’s opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the current situation."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
All the predictions said they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the JHA and any State could block any decision.
That's why things were very little integrated into justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure was applied, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approved it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, to represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there were rejection reactions in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's unbeginner's policy and they didn't want to appear in many countries as a reaction of the "EU type sends us migrants on our heads".
They postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will probably witness big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex agency in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece can, you can't say infinitely it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, of sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they come to them.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will start to take the migrants up: you go to country X or Y country.
It will probably be reached at some unique filtration centers, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are inexperienced countries, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenofobic current.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have just started to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave next year maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it so catastrophically from a media point of view.
You talked about countries with less or greater experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in the case of other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.
But purely police means won't work.
To create the fortress Europe is illusory.
We need to be tampered with the mechanisms of integration into European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more picky.
Let’s ask these people to learn the language, to try to take up the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and with one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through the marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them as we drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there is an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Before solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries where they first set foot these migrants.
I mean, we're running freely from there, but each one's with his problems.
In the face of such a wave it is not so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run, not much changes.
After the attacks in France we do not have a much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public excitement that sets in both ways.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of speech, many bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be viril.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted for the current situation.
How has Romania played in this crisis so far?
Like a small country, which believes that if it draws the cap on its eyes and plugs its ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your problem with a small country.
That's what we've done, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will greatly decrease.
President Iohannis says it’s maybe good that we haven’t already entered.
So we move from the desperation of the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, unique deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From that point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime probably collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
A couple of years was a battle between the Assad regime and moderate laic and Muslim militias, supported by Gulf countries and Westerners.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates hotbeds of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you are only great power if you have solutions.
Off-side game is just a strategy to gain time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to him, to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
Offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another the issues created by him.
But I don't agree with theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the one of "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of the company, announced on his account that the button will be available soon, the New York Times reports on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would rather show a nuance of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wanted to avoid moments when someone posts a major event in his account in life, and someone else would give “Dislike.”
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Zuckerberg also said it was not very comfortable for people to “Like” to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable to like that post,” the Facebook representative said.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There was already enough hate on Facebook and social media," Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted on the matter.
"I'll 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, claimed there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
What's more, she claims, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, one handful of thousands on the mass coming to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA reminds.
The move drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Ahead of the imposition of new immigration laws, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also broke into Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" headquarters of the County Council is about to fail.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, stand to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The County Council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling on its own.
A year and a half when the construction and refunctionalization of the building should have been completed, the works have not reached half either.
A last stage in the epic of the building was consumed the other day, when the National Council for Settlement of Appeals (CNSC) rejected a complaint of the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a participation announcement with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project, and then a new tender for the works will be organized.
"The negotiations, however, were not finalized by a contract, the CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," Razvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ, said in a statement.
The decision of the CJ to interrupt the direct negotiations was appealed in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iasi Court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that the CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be taken into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, the building's consolidation work could resume as early as next year.
Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we have to reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be appealed or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chest began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012 after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being adjudicated by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company became insolvent, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has been done so far in the proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalization and atticing works of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"No more, I'm saying it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to admit the facts, against imprisonment with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, headed by the former boss, Narcisa Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi accused by the DNA in a corruption case has admitted his actions.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges agreeing to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of intellectual forgery in continuous form and agreed to execute two years of postponemental prison, as well as community service.
Regarding the facts imputed to Dascalu, the prosecutors specified that he, as an adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "formally drew up several minutes of acceptance, regarding the service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I.. Iasi with the administrators of the companies SC Gaus SRL, SC Grup Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency de Cadastru and Topografia SRL and PFA Lipşa Ștefan, who were not attesting, in an unrealisty, that the contracted services were fully carried out, given that they were not carried out and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. “Achieved.”
The other day, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to trial in this case, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The damage exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the training of the women's handball national team for Olympic qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, stated yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this it must pass two stages of caudo forks, first of all the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu also said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
They are fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will consist of seven or eight people.
He wants assistant coach, doctor, two measures, coach of goalkeepers, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to obtain some things for qualification, namely materials for physical training, which we have never heard of.
All to get to the Olympics. And I will do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we are fighting with have these materials and they have for some time," said Dedu, who noted that he is trying to get the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure issue and it's shameful to question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods were built entirely in a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona there was a landfill, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organization of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
"In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.
Mr. Gatu went civilly with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but they were very quickly clear that the hall will never be built.
I also had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and after that we discuss concretely.
"So we have the whole opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all the coaches to be reserved in prognosis, that if they do not come back against them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players make their debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, told a press conference on Tuesday that all the members of the Romanian squad are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to achieve two victories: "We are ready".

Romania’s national team manager, Lynn Howells, at the first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: “It’s a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup”.
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's a great experience for me.
For me it is very important that at every match I make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that the Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, it's a gang of friends, who set out to realize a dream," Dumitras said.

14 million lei given to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" from Iasi at budget rectification
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in works of modernization and arrangement of some clinics, but also in equipment and medical equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology device, with six kits used for surgery, six properly equipped ICU beds, ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Breast Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will make the reception of the works from the walkway that connects the UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics," the manager of the medical unit also explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tătăraşi, which it will organize in the outpatient, in the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology in the ambulatory is located and will have about 30 beds.
Iasi, embarrassed by RATP controllers and a leaflet.
The Fate of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience I and my wife don't want to step in your city again.
Unwittingly, they hit the erroneous information in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "that the law says so".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were included.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Iasi.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because there was no tonne with tickets in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they can get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers has appeared.
They said that there is no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was canceled.
WHY DID I Told what was written in the local press, I came the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said that all they can do is give us a single fine instead of 2 (mi and my wife).
“I paid, I didn’t want to ruin my day to visit by sitting at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!”, says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who "applied the law to the blood."
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, it's not a lot of money, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The magistrates of Iasi tried the first court term in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the hearing, one of the judges of Iasi to whom the file was assigned, Viorel Munteanu, filed a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Penanel Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted an appeal filed by four of the defendants, ordering their placement in house arrest.
Currently, the case is judged by a panel of which includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the case, Judge Dan Anhinta also filed a abstention, on the grounds that his daughter was in a cohabitation relationship with one of the rapists’ lawyers.
The two judges have decided that the rapists from Vaslui will continue to remain in pre-trial detention.
Young people will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the judges will rediscuss their possibility of release.
The next trial will take place at the Iasi Court of Appeal on October 6.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car that had exited the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end Păcurari.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Administration of Penitentiaries preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on the Stables, then on the ring road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport, to take over the inmates.
Soon, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Maximum Security Penitentiary Iasi, which took over the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
In the accident, none of the arrested men were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the detainees came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles have agreed amicably on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Țăranu, of the IPJ.
Great migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what is to come.
But Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the notirty 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represents, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good solidarity intentions with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into the Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The impotence to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
On top of that, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent healthcare, tighten the mess on the street, create honorably paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is in particular the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first encounter the bellicose hypocrisy of strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of stealing any of them as a national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoking the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be mocked.
Causes must be eliminated, some argue and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for migrant countries of origin.
But there is peace in Romania and some foreign capital in the national economy from time to time enters Romania - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed to us as an ankylosed construction, divided and overwhelmed by the situation.
I was decrying the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but the EU does not have any future plan either.
And improvisations and threats do not help.
Then, what is the use of the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as if through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be ready for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically, imposed
The auction for the concession is aimed at a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concessions for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of hubs.
The CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary café, bookstore or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bid step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and cover entirely the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public catering unit functioned in these premises, nor after its evacuation, current repair and maintenance works were carried out as they are currently necessary during the exploitation of a building," the documentation related to the tender procedure reads.
The club's concession deals are expected by September 18.
Two brothers in Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to hospital
Two children aged 9 and 11, respectively from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medication was not hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the mists of the 90’s, when she had only two months of life, little girl, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman from Iasi, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in Iasi with her parents.
Crina will turn 20 these days, and her foster parents in Palermo have thought to give their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know their unclear past.
"Ziarul de Iași", who witnessed the efforts to search the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, in the city.
Home there began to be misunderstandings between the parents, and the mother had to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me away from home.
He stopped the girl, and I didn't know anything since.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalled Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and then the girl’s father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would separate forever.
They couldn't find Crina in the hospital
After admission, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He may have thought he was abandoned," says a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child’s fate during this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave her to care for the Bucium Placement Center.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than in Romania today.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt it was our face.
"It's like my wife gave her life," Salvadore, the foster father, tells us, while catching the girl's filthy hand in his hand.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costică, continued separately the searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may be deceased, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court she was away in Italy in Palermo.
And conditions to look for her I didn't have.
We prayed to God to be well.
I thought of her in all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," tells us with tears in the eyes of the biological mother of Crina.
But even if the years passed, the parents in Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past connects her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania", confesses Crina.
Her dream was coming to come true.
In March this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search started only from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I received only one name, Balcan Costică, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Shortly after, I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there was the name received in the locality.
Then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the one wanted.
"It lasted about a month before we found the girl's biological father," explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, more than three months they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since each had their domicile in another locality.
We started the steps sometime in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided that in September there will be a first meeting," added Romică Ichim.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costică saw their lost girl in the hallways of the Iasi hospital 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
He's barely changing a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, shaking.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a granddaughter, who came with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Crina's meeting with mother and biological brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costică Balcan told him, among other things, that if he wants to return to him, in the village, to come quietly: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to encroach a household.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly thinks that something like this can happen to her.
I am very excited.
I never thought something like this could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about it in these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that too.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," says with great tears on Alina's cheeks, the mother of Crina, as she holds a napkin tightly.
He hides his tears, happiness, because he will soon see her face after so long.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has sketched a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting they try to gather their thoughts, because she has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are, after all, the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
The first family reunion in Iasi
In Unirii Square, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the family of Ruginoasa unites again its destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
No longer separate borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of the local in the center of Iasi, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first event of its kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I am glad to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, people addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to restore to society something good back.
"If I am asked for such an event again, I will do it with great love," says Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling in Iasi.
Behind him, the Balcans, with Crina in the middle, walk away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns at the foot yesterday at PSD.
Everyone catches their soul
The camps in the Iasi branch of the PSD have concluded a truce with a gun at the foot.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the executive chairman of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats from Iasi will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow the combatants to draw their breath.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"By then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was settled.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the Iasi branch of the party are State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councilor Vasile Catea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant considered is also the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors of PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer join the race, party sources stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on election day, candidacies can be submitted, and no one would surprise if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will stay after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Bureau and all new leadership structures," said Catea.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections will practically be ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
“But, on the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Iași presidency, the list remaining open,” Stanciu commented.
A judge refused the case of the violators in Vaslui on the grounds of cohabitation
The seven young people from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments today regarding their release, after the substantive court, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the lawyers of the defendants, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest punishment in this case.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the reasoning, the judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
"The court finds that after the moment of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure," reads the motivation of the Vaslui Court.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church floor".
“The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wished to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext,” the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue the same in the coming years.
Until Saturday, few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder to what extent it can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labour.
A professed anti-monarchist Marxist (a moment he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (was also regularly invited to comment on the political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up its nuclear weapons.
For Cornn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like those he was saying and promised and Tsipras in Greece until he faced the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader envisages, among other things, massive renationalizations and printing money as a solution for financing projects for the development and coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have a general world prosperity!, but who would still stumble on such details.
Sure, we can tax bankers in blood, you become a kind of service enemies of the left, but from what it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande’s mandates.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed by the generous, cover-up promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point other people's money ends."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 80's another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs anyway as the party's fresh leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working-class class in the UK, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automations have caused the industry to require massively highly skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
However, even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that the election of Corbyn increases the chances of Brexit, namely the UK’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes the foundations of the EU you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide in the wake of the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep rifts created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between the North and South, between East and West, leaves room for scenarios of the most worrying.
All the more so since for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin becomes more and more dominant actor anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers for the country remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the head of the big majority of member states by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening in the context in which the electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation starting from the national interest.
If voters make the decision of the brain, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuels their populist rhetoric from frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-image area, both provoked by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect Romania’s situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take the workshop too!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his fame, however, something almost forgotten today is hidden, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It's called "toil."
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What is there to say, really?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And, recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years since he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And, when he goes outside with the offspring, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brancusi".
The country is full of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Nor did the communists manage to extract it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes today are stuffing the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would be to say, to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck to be born in some big city and in a well-wealth, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brâncuși’s life is the perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe that's where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the stupid success stories that are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard of it an entire world?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancusi was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in Peeștișani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one from which he would collect the landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Ţuţea, from Paris, from 1933: "Basily then was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have been happily leading a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilisation of the great city has reached us.
But Brancusi’s childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that have characterized the future sculptor for years in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancusi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the țuica was made "la cazan", following those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with a bitch and drinks breathlessly.
Falls in sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother panicked, then into hysteria, thinking her son had died.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by the fiddlers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who wait for him with his breath.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds that it is good to call Baba Brindusa, doctor and servant of Brancusi.
The brandy checks the baby's breathing, then puts them under her godmother horse's ball, gathered from the whole world.
The child sneezes strongly.
The world is applauding.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drunkenness, for joy, the party with the fiddlers continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brancusi has Constantin to collect some twigs and bring them to him.
The father puts his child upside down and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And, while feeling the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be viewed from a different perspective and that things around can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, if the star himself participated in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father had been?
The city currently does not work
An MP calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuţ appealed to PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great division and that's it.
I didn't see any of the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how the politicians dispute their possible locations according to the real estate interests.
Let's put aside politics a bit, let's get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
"If you are busy with the internal war, you no longer have time for those who chose you," Blăjuţ said.
He appreciated that the current political class has demoted the electorate in Iasi, the consequence being a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
Also, the MP believes that the voters will also focus on the traditional parties, expressing their reservation towards new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iasi" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break away from the right-wing electorate, not from that of the PSD.
Such parties rely on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
"It is framing even more the right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blăjuţ said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to enroll in the race for the City Hall.
I also said that I do not want to run for any local office.
I am still thinking about whether to continue as an MP in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the discussions on the halls, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blăjuţ, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of elected officials.
A colleague from Tatarași said that the money is not enough and he has to go by bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the money from the cashier.
At the end of the mandate I will make a report with everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the employees in the cabinet and its maintenance.
I happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and the rest.
"To say a parliamentarian that the money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuţ concluded.
