UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year-old conflict, and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet foreign ministers from five countries permanently on the council this month — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers showing Donald Trump has a real chance
Some tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by double-digit percentages, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of appointment.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits points out that around the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nominating race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are acknowledging Trump's power and starting to back him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest the real estate mogul isn't just something fleeting:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had climbed to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "pleased" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "excited" versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as an issue.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
The same numbers are found in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
Still, 44 percent think he lacks the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is genuine.
According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four in 10 said Trump.
That has changed since late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full briefing: In the past, GOP voters haven't read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to just 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that a majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even though Republicans pulled back toward another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of everything.
Some say the split situation is likely to contribute to Trump's victory, while support for Trump will split to more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University found that, in the hypothetical event of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump would almost always have majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and finally 33 points each behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one showdown.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don't change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their choice.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have decided to vote for Trump are twice as likely.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been a central topic in the 2016 campaign.
Some worry that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to Monday's ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider over someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg found that three in four Iowa Republicans were frustrated with the performance of Republicans in COngres, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "nervous."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's Questions debut
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; His performance is likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
In weekly appearances, he called for "less theater and more facts."
He also stated that he could give up some participations and give them to his colleagues.
The clash will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test of leadership, coming after he appointed a "ghost cabinet" and a speech he gave at the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent at the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said Mr Corbyn had "respectfully remained silent" and acknowledged the "heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme he would have recommended that the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's lead team, citing differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "piling up" in the Labour Party following Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position on the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the idea of limitation entirely.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Labour and Pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to cut the cap level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the rostrum in a decade since he took over as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has "externally sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said PMQs involved too high a level of confrontation and that he would refrain from retaliation and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would take his place at PMQs when he was unable to attend - for example when Mr Cameron travelled abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he took office in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to abandon the "Punch and Judy" style often associated with PMQs, but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow MPs, though critics say it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
'Setting in Joburg': Homeless youth benefit from photography classes
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met one of the project's first graduates.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill says an increase in the UK minimum wage could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves words of praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' outrageous slippage over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios to the ground and I should have knocked this kid to the ground."
Although he was last seen making a dusty racket after experiencing muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was vigorously defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn into the conflict a little bit," Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a racket when he lost to cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's face it, he's mastered extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family by his side and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has not had any conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in the dressing rooms, he trains hard, he is in great shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his qualities and flaws.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the best fit for all, but supported the Canberra-born player's long-term return to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to be totally focused on the draw match and not think about the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios] at all," Healy said.
And I think Nick has climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's maturing in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of what he's doing, and I think he needs a time where he's not in the spotlight to be able to reflect.  Good work for both the team and him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
With at least five months to go before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton supporters are firmer in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
Support among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is just 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated and she is now tied with Sanders.
Yet Clinton still has an advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digit percentages among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in that group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support her somewhat reservedly, and another 15% would support her just because she represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that current Clinton supporters will be enthusiastic about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those not currently supporting Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about first-place finisher Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open-ended question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16 percent), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also mention of agreement on these aspects and eligibility.
With the vice president considering a possible run for president, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race — though a third think he shouldn't run.
When asked about the second choice for party representative, Democratic voters overwhelmingly call Biden a majority.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate most likely to win the general election; But the numbers are down from 78% last month.
Biden is remotely in second place, but the percentage that he is most eligible has risen.
However, when asked what's most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues to eligibility.
As of last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, do well on a few key characteristics relative to their party's primary voters.
Most voters view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as upright and trustworthy and with solid leadership.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30 percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is upright and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think of him.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, share the same ideologies as them.
On all of this, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have an opinion of Sanders.
With questions lingering about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it has not affected their overall opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say they have changed their mind negatively.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their mind of Clinton negatively.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton upright and trustworthy, this continues to pose problems for her among voters generally: Only 32 percent consider her upright and trustworthy, 8 percentage points fewer than last month and 15 percentage points fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not consider her upright and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide do not consider Trump upright and trustworthy.
Still, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
Greater numbers of those who consider Sanders upright than those who disagree, but as with Carson, many do not.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members indicted for murder of Baruch 1st year student
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation rite in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put on his back a 14kg backpack filled with sand and repeatedly assaulted while trying to head towards a target on icy ground.
Mr. Deng complained of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members started hiding their personal belongings and basically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family attorney, said in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be indicted on charges of outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner told a news conference Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history gives little clue to timeframe.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates start to rise, but on the trajectory of time it takes to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at stake.
But in the end, market players may find that all the fuss about interest rate hikes has been exaggerated.
"The first interest rate hike decided by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here is how several sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of interest rate hikes may volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for return on capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the shift in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's hikes.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply — by about 14 percent — heading for interest rate hikes, quite invariable in the 250-day period after (average climb of 2.6 percent) before returning to normal after 500 days, with an average rebound over the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by Nuveen Asset Management's chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate hike cycle, and benefits begin to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its all-time low point for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP has been less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a hike decision from the Fed, with all eyes on this week's Federal Open Market Commission meeting, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted since 1950, all interest rate hike cycles to date have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery begins," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; The record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that these interest rate hikes will bring returns closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although "we're still cautious about forcing returns," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adjusted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in expected inflation, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the spread of the average credit interest rate has widened, and volatility has increased — all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Overall, companies that mostly operate in the U.S. will benefit from interest rate hikes and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debt will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital receipts as well as low-volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could also benefit, though experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Andrew Bingham MP
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for being "foolish"
It states that it is increasingly similar to the commercial adversary
He also took issue with the BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiarized the Brits Awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying the show wasn't original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, a senior MP has said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial broadcasters are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that public radio was "foolish" and increasingly resembling its commercial opponent.
"I think Radio 3 is 'silly' – although I don't like to use the word – but I think it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - those are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director-general denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and audience education.
I won't find out anywhere about classical music what I learn from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
"In addition, I think Radio 3's commitment to discovering new music and allocating new songs is also important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract audiences than before because Britons had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC banner criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22m.
Do you understand why there is often discussion about that show because it is not original and indistinguishable by nothing?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be produced "in a BBC-specific manner".
He added that he wants the corporation to "find the golden egg hen in its own backyard" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban new seasons of The Voice from being picked up in the future or spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales saw the smallest increase in August, and Black Friday could be the culprit
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The past month has seen its slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales gained momentum three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the UK's shopping streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of just 5% in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phone to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and do so in various circumstances, such as from the sofa.
But now that it's stagnating a bit, you might see a drop (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to get their hands on deals, leading to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers have been battling for bargains, could cause shoppers to reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After sanctioning Bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed in Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were injured in the crane collapse
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane that collapsed at Mecca's grand mosque.
Dressed in white, mourners joined on the road to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of their final journey at Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funeral after Saudi Arabia's king sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 people injured.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane that collapsed at Mecca's grand mosque.
Among the victims was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi News Agency, said the Binladin Group partly bore the blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not give the details, but said company leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the crane collapse and representatives of the Group could not be reached for comment.
The royal decree blamed the group for failing to use updated safety measures and coordinate its work with weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and has been carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disinherited by his family in the 90s.
The collapse occurred in strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have ordered relatives of the deceased victims to receive one million Saudi riyals (£174,000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers for conversion of loans in Swiss francs into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process regarding the conversion of loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data accumulated by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate on lei, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Banca Transilvania's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive discounts: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and management fees paid by the client, then an additional discount of 22.5% was applied to the RON balance.
Both offers reduce their customers' rates compared to what they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of CHF loans in lei is that currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases in the franc, and the loan reimbursement will be made in the currency in which he receives his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no revaluation of the property, no additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly installment, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the installment in the first years consists more of interest, and the client repays very little of the principal.
Bancpost's offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is not known, however, how this interest rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so overall the cost reduction is also lower.
A possible risk for all variable interest loans in RON is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, there may be other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve
The world is looking ahead to a meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, now believe the situation will hold for some time and interest rates will remain in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could move away from zero and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to its balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also rumored to have struggled with drug use, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been sitting on the bar for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended in defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury stemmed from a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke through PSV's defence.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then he will be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, struggles, then plays fantastically and now something like this is happening.
He was put on an oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno apparently got lucky and escaped a red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it's foul and red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I am starting the road to recovery, I will come back stronger."

The England defender has one more reason to recover to play at next year's European Championship in France in June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very nasty injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also ended up in hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding on
Winning against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, having seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I am not considering a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in Test matches.
I wouldn't rule out an away win either.
Alastair Cook's side may have less experience than three years ago, but they have good players on spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; They will not be marked by the events of 2012, but will have a positive, youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali plays as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Related topics: Adam Lyth left the England team for the Test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his Yorkshire head coach, I find it difficult to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played his seven Test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this previously - the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not up to his ability and I am not surprised by that; First of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes for a batsman to get noticed in quiz matches.
Lyth had seven runs — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton were lucky at home and away.
The only complaint you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman whom I rate very well.
He is a cricketer who has the 'X factor' and who we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was floated for Moeen to open alongside Cook, which would lead to the extra spinner while retaining four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there, and this left-handed player has already shown he's.
Moeen may not have brought success to his Worcestershire district, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test 38 matches as a first drop before he entered the Open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age - averaging 31 on batting and 35 on ball - and think he is punt, but there are not a bunch of spinners and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tournament.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they convey messages that have been sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is resting for one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although they don't all agree, coaches and selectors don't make the program.
And you have to keep in mind, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy continues to lull until 2017
With each passing day, David Cameron's strategy of renegotiating to keep Britain in the EU is getting into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn, at the helm of the Labour Party, or TUC, made serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
The Aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - immersed in crises similar to the one in the EU - not all of which are provoked internally - some member states are fueled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at its annual meeting, the TUC decided they didn't want that too if it eroded Social Protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the roof of the EU — "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin declares — suggests that several short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher, 11, Mitterrand, 14, and Kohl, 16, who stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe they will help English possers, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don't want either, as most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers may even plan to intentionally make non-helpful remarks, SNP-style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my buddy suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain got nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know firsthand how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical are the oligarchic media barons who view the EU with scepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 90s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-taxpaying crooks, foreigners who defrauded by phone, and pseudo non-doms who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him to stop spending his time with me - seems in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC he left vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism" might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far or losing his cabinet position.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "in any situation" — Benn's phrase — doesn't match what McDonnell said, nor does it match what JC told colleagues and lawmakers during Monday night's private meeting.
Whatever image Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it touched me too – message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favour in Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophistry about EU membership — consistent with their anti-capitalist pasts — is no longer merely an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistry on NATO — Tom Watson is adamant that the JC won't campaign for quitting — foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when everything might be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed with Britain's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Department of Public Health England's decision on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team has joined the Lancet in criticising evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its "benchmark" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
But several researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their substantiation "on solid ground or quicksand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said they expect PHE's claims that "current estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; The results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT's accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting reported funding from an e-cigarette maker but not funding reported to have received from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are some well-known "leaders" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Head of Tobacco Control Section at PHE.
The group's research paper "convincingly covers" that there is a lack of "solid evidence of harm that most products have by most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes constitute a factor encouraging smoking among children or nonsmokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health at PHE, said the BMJ allegations had been answered in the past.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two people who have smoked all their life loses their lives due to this vice.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what information emerges and what does not emerge from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Every year, around 80,000 people die from a smoking-related illness and the annual costs to the NHS from smoking reach £2 billion.
By making clear the current evidence - that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they only have a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video against the arms fair.
Terrible killer drones!
Irons for crushing ankles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause excruciating pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fierce charade, carried out by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed at bus stops and on subways needing a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between September 15 and 18?" says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on DLR Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6-pound pack of Allen keys that it says "facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet."
The London Transport Authority is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flywheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing they need to get out into the real world for their art to impact society.
Another poster against the arms trade welcoming commuters riding the subway.
Amnesty's film had more than 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by ad agency VCCP, which worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voice dubber also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence surrounding the ad for the arms fair — with an empty space on the ExCel calendar — and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with making the ad more realistic, but "enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking."
"They did a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the arms fair-themed comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order it received from the U.S. military regarding "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers breathtaking effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dorm when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed — and the many complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring conditions that range from nervous breakdown to dread.
The chatter is tempting: telling people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from your studies, what you think of Corbyn and why "honestly, you don't care Marmite because, really, it's nothing but YEAST extract HAHAHA, you can find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe too – ask questions and show interest.
They liven up the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the people you wouldn't talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who had boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try on their underwear.

Introverts get special treatment at university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but many homes build a culture of wandering through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization, and lifelong friendships.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to recharge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want us to stay friends, but I want you to leave to get back the energy I spent interacting with you."
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted from socializing – and try texting instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who lived in the same dorm as me had a policy that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough.
Make friends by cooking.
Given that you're starting university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and bring a plate of brownies, it seems less weird, less like the situation in the 50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now he's smiling and I'm asking personal questions."
Homemade goodies are a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel compelled to chat and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you need to be a skilled cook.
Clumps of flour, sugar, and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Obviously, wiping someone's chicken is stealing, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is it still stealing?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it's boiling on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I understand you – you're still trying to approach the problem more maturely than my dormmate, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He is now in prison.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, but because you're literally walking on shards.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to turn down the music because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to turn up the music.
When they finally turned off the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep for two hours before turning on the music, locked the door, and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you mistook a colleague for your future husband, hooked up, broke up, and had to meet daily and maybe even watch him take over all your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't resist your heart – but if a sexy co-worker certainly isn't your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The thrilling moment you realize someone has left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between prank and bullying is finer than it sounds.
A successful prank is funny, but it can distort in moments.
Teach a fun and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something—but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer — but don't stick someone's belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of an unusual project, downright "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor,  And that makes her at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was at this year's Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, was the soloist, and one on Monday, when cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being always present.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
True, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I am talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
Therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
So if you look at this world, you have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen but has to watch, which is stupid again," says David Grimal.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of "musical deceptions" in his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras in order to earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry as well.
10 years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I found no sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time nobody did such a thing without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" he asks.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project for a living.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance to the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's performance "there were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very courageous" one, precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present and play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates changing the way classical music education is done, believing that "the profession of musician, as it is organized today, has a whiff of death" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to tour the world 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, album releases, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you joined the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up at the service of supermarkets, as they do in France.
With music the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
"If we considered – as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would be no need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that's everywhere, it's something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier it has to be one way, if we want to train a musician, it is quite another.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the French artist with a smile.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized within the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

Cinema City searches for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the coolest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the superproduction "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to dub two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classic cartoons emphasis was placed on bringing the actor's voice closer to the specifics of the animated character, lately, when creating the story, those who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
However, Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a unique campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enter their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a preselection following which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register the child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Subsequently, they must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record himself performing his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants for the competition: "Yellow Feathers 3D", "Mune: Moon Guardian 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Mischievous Koala 3D" and "Maya Bee 3D".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will dub a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Crăiasa Snowii 3D", which will have its premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings mixed, lower fiscal forecast for 2016
FedEx delivered disappointing results for the final quarter, with the delivery giant cutting full-year profit estimates due to weak demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell rang.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts had forecast the figure at $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite prices rising by 4.9% on average, with effect on January 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipping of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects year-over-year earnings growth as a result of cost reduction, higher revenue and e-commerce growth.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that "the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global manufacturing and trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number of hires it made last year.
In the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to Zacks Investment Research's survey.
Profit rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' survey estimated it at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnant revenue at its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has jumped the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the revenue of the ground division increased by 29%, but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw revenue increase due to higher base fares, while freight division's revenue declined due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
At close on Tuesday, they were down 11% year-on-year and 17% from their record high on June 11.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a table of 27-foot Honduran mahogany to decide whether it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank meeting room, a mural of the United States will be glimpsed.
The map is meant to serve as a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And that third task could be factor X in a hard-to-predict decision to be announced Tuesday that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be rid of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.
Even though most of the data points to a strong growth economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate on federal funds — even just by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg anticipated an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with one key indicator showing that the probability of growth is just 30%.
That would indicate a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, unless policymakers soften the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next hike.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The momentum was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates at this point," Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do this, "they would need to act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise rates by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate hike this year, despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Earnings showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to go into fibrillation later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"Without what has happened in financial markets and news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and they almost don't have any data to rely on after events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
Then-then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's mere hint in 2013 that the Fed might "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered tremors in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly entwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the decision-making body that has supported interest rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that has hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite implications with limited identification for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those declines.
The Fed should only put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis like the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to end up fearing an interest rate hike because markets have been upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take action prematurely.
Looking for a great Thai market?
Try Chinatown's LAX-C.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a breathtaking range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated produce, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also an auto district where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk through all the aisles.
If you get hungry from so much buying, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food aisle (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several takeaway options.
What's in stock: Do you need something – anything- Thai?
You probably find it at LAX-C.
Products are reasonably priced and certain items are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes herbs, fruits, and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat aisle is large, and so is the fish aisle – the serving staff will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find frozen curry leaves, melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and much more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping trolleys and fork trolleys.
The find: fresh durian fruit right next to the area of the houses.
Where it's located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown — a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although chances are that the store will get crowded, it is usually not difficult to find parking.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite attempts by channel Nine to cover the change in party leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's urgent trip to Canberra to report on the consequences of changes in the leadership of the Liberal party did not bring a significant increase in audience for Today.
Nine's morning show broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
Competing show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to audiences on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the numbers were lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
So far, as of September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered resoundingly that "yes".
Seven's X Factor held its ground with 1.136 million viewers, slightly ahead of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven experienced ups and downs on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new science show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) climbed to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half saw a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia's drop in viewership on the second night will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint at a Siberian airport.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company, Yukos, was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, some of whom threw rocks and molotov cocktails.
Mr Dhakal said the police force used tear gas before firing shots into the air before resorting to using rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are commonly used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces created under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes that began on August 10.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country governed centrally for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and guns
The Prime Minister continues the exchange with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday's cabinet meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with guns.
"It is a shame for Europe in the 21st century to apply methods from the 30s." said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at Thursday's CSAT meeting. " concluded the prime minister.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point has a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles Islands also shows a 60 percent probability of a tropical cyclone forming within the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-reduction surgery could be useful in diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-reduction surgery for people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight-loss surgery than those undergoing nonsurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical diabetes treatments remained almost at the same level, at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the medical group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" — reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more considerable decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and were more likely to have complete remission of diabetes mellitus (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavyweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona School of Medicine – Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it's an optimistic look for people with BMIs under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this work is critical because it affirms that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she states.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long to urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of Oxford's Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was inadequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to care for several thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I offered my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. Poison Counter-Poison Centers have reported an approximately 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, cases of ingesting hand detergent in children under the age of 12 reported to poison centers climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress friends or respond to challenges on social media.
YouTube shows videos showing teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that the teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think it's hurting them," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand detergent) are perfumed ones.
Hand cleaners with strawberry, grape, orange flavor are most attractive to children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Kansas City's Fox Channel 4.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if children reach for them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand detergent at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was babbling and unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as she fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wet wipes and keep hand detergent out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared, toxic ingredient.
Health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and has banned it from her classroom.
The police considered the plan "trivial" and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer give Celtic match summary; Why?"
Because there are no Rangers there.
Here, there is not only talk of the return of Rangers.
There is talk of the Old Firm.
There's talk of both teams together, and that's where the interest goes.
Tension is high in Old Firm matches and it's not just Scots who want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, promises Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic were fighting hard, but the Norwegian boss vowed to change the situation.
The defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, now at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods ahead and will recover."
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
So do we - but we must go further.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
It is extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's caution over January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified some targets for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to damage Ibrox's unity.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different to the summer. "
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, something you have seen this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in unnecessary players.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clashes with SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then disallowed - his third red card disallowed in eight months.
Neilson stands by his statements, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to task after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn region ahead of a derby against Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," said the striker, adding: "Needless to say, I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I'm playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United's management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has confidence that the management team will turn things around - but agrees the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy for 'dirty win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits the Aberdeen side must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to claim their seventh successive league win that earned them five points over Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick.
McInnes said: "There's no team that's won anything, in the cup or league, and hasn't won games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while UK rises
Scotland's unemployment rate remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the UK overall rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's 5.9% unemployment rate was higher than Britain's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, Scotland's employment rate fell by 12,000 in the three-month period, with 2,612,000 currently employed.
Scotland's employment rate fell in the quarter to 74.0% – a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The authorities' long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in Scotland's labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, barring belated legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will sit in an observer room in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip be executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I cringe at the idea.
So, why should I?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will view the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own bond with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities said I could not be both a witness and a journalist, so I would not be allowed to carry a notebook and pen to write down what I saw.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he "could have formulated it better", but still believes they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I won't go back over all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think its execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from that perspective.
I cannot claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from racing
Peter Moody claimed Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw from racing immediately.
He launched an attack on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they were running a personal campaign against him, the final straw being Lady Tatai's removal from the race due to treatment given on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do his best for the racing field and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidari's positive cobalt test result, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach for grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that it all flares up all at once," Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and have to face the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head held high and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up the job of trainer.
At that point I will have to think about what I will do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man – whose name I will say if asked – and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously they consider me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and still know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having backbone and perhaps hold people outside of trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements they are making now might make them think about this option.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with Lidari's lengthy cobalt testing investigation, and the removal led him to say he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training undefeated champion Black Caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a poultice of mud or clay was applied to horses' feet, which broke the rules.
Break race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put sludge on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day of poultice, for which stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but we have gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the scene in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and followed by fleeing the scene.
The cyclist was flown by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He is expected to be charged with fleeing the scene, failing to provide first aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his team's cladding tactics "skewed topics" brought up by the NRL's top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to "slam" his team in Storm's nervously won win in the qualifying final played in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos manager Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his side's win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of his team's cladding tactics and stated that players simply focused on "contact" when plating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches criticised his team, meaning they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And it doesn't stop there — we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that in the last six weeks we've really put the focus on contact in cladding and that's how we changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team, so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny as it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Bennett's Dragons won the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about thrilling football.
He argued his opinion by comparing Saturday night's game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George's received a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he wasn't interested in the bit of black under his fingernail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to make when you have players like that.
He made this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they thought about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between the Storms and Roosters was a fiercer scoring contest compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, does that mean thrilling game?
Or thrilling means taking breaks and not scoring?
For me they are plans.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have earned the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks at home in next Saturday's qualifying final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to demand images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg grabbed the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged into an online messaging service, where another user sent him a series of lewd images of children as a subject.
The girl later woke up to notice the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
He looked into his phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After arriving, police viewed the five pictures, then analyzed computers found at the address and found "troubling" Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "lure pedophiles" onto the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but said he did it because he wanted to impersonate a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and asked that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
She said she no longer thinks clearly when she drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mum and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on her phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used his computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of taking or taking indecent pictures of child subjects, and violating parole conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court at his March 24 appearance.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be registered on the sex offender register because it could be said that the crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."
Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in the case but remained in custody ahead of appearances for other cases.
He was placed on the sex offender register before sentencing.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell onto the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is worthless.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year. HP will split its exchange into two companies, separating its computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure," said Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help transition businesses to the new style of doing business," Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing unrivaled integrated solutions" for enterprises.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose Palo Alto garage has been called the "cradle of Silicon Valley", splits.
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest computer maker and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest in the field, building on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching their 15-year peak.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Men, wanting to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "in a healthy mood," his chances of recovery double.
Equally, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social media, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediacy of response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that affect our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by their jobs but by their own personalities, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in their comfortable armchairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they often shy away from exploring their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me, "My role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old adage to fend for yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention through the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you're attending this weekend's FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full replay of the sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends airs on Comedy Central from start to finish — all 236 episodes — on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG sideline Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League opener on Tuesday and helped PSG prevail against Swedish side Malmo.
Below we present the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League group stage run with a reassuring 2-0 win over Malmo in Tuesday's match at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into PSG's Champions League opener, giving the French champions the lead, although they missed a number of opportunities before securing the advantage with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's goal is not only to qualify for the eighths but also to improve their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's men were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the scoring opportunity before being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets up a comfortable gap to the next runners-up, even if there are still aspects we need to improve throughout the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we didn't manage to concede another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury to one of his three changes to the Paris side with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine attacking midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he sprang up Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before he incredibly shot over Johan Wiland in the long corner to the right of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to get the win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team starters with a five-man defence and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot that went past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down a few times, making a few unnecessary passes and failing to complete interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after play resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved much more adept at supporting his teammates, his pass being the one Di Maria sent into a shot deflected by Wiland across goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour had elapsed thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic made a pass from Maxwell's cross.
That goal dashed Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from distance for the rejection David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal in injury time.
Malmo Norwegian coach Age Hareide later said PSG were one class above and that "The last game we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad plan to massively reduce debt.
London-listed Glencore said it had sold £1.6bn worth of new shares to pay off debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is struggling with collapsing commodity prices as China's slowing economic activity influences demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The preferential subscription right boosted Glencore's share price on the London Stock Exchange in trading Wednesday morning.
Shares climbed 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold its new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday's closing price.
It removed 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the growth of China's protracted stagnant economy led to iron ore prices rising substantially by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities falling by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy needed to open up more broadly to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving openness policies," Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make way for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also loosen controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private investment.
"The state authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investments and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', streamlining requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and educating judges and prosecutors.
Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with Government's proposal to increase salaries by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and leaders of education unions have not reached any result, with the Government proposing a 10% salary increase from December 1, with payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanting a 15% increase from November or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister being accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cîmpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
Today's Government proposal did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than what we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, said at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, an FSLI meeting will be held in which Government representatives will also participate to present to representatives of confederations in the country the proposal for salary increase, and trade unionists will decide whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The prime minister also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the wage law to parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act stipulates the increase of salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase provided in the document to be made in stages in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised trade unionists to fully acquit the 2016 court sentences.
Migrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish waters on Tuesday after their boat sank.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading to the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people who were in the wrecked boat, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two more people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was wrecked.
The route has become popular lately for migrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 stewards and stewardesses for being overweight, the airline announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist."
The mass layoff is the latest in a decade-long battle between the company and plump stewardesses.
The weight limit for them dates back to the 80s when Air India started using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses deemed "exceptionally overweight" as this "can have an effect on reflexes and hinder the agility required to carry out emergency measures".
The flight attendants sued, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed," a company spokesman explained at the time.
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in Dej, the local kids being expected at a first selection action.
I am extremely happy to have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry materially in training.
They have only one concern: to play football to the best of their ability.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They need to showcase their talent.
This is what the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," footballer Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Children up to 11 years old are expected at Steaua's defender's academy.
The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it through a congressional decision, we will do that too.
There will be no emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the uncertainty of governing or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD National Standing Bureau meeting.
PSD announces when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message be given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will weigh on Monday, after the Executive Committee, whether the date of the convention is also set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the party leadership," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Standing Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation to announce his candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy when the date of the Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of Social Democrat branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided by the party's Executive Committee on Monday.

Italian caught at Bors customs with migrants hiding in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were detected on Monday at Bors customs while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of a truck driven by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigations, it was established that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, informs the Border Police.
At the specific check, the border guards noticed in the cab of the truck a large travel bag, containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered two male persons hidden in the semi-trailer of the truck, among the plastic crates.
The checks showed that the persons concerned, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
"During the investigations, the young people declared that they intended to reach France, which is why they contacted a fellow countryman, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person," reads the press release of the Border Police.
The two migrants were issued "criminal papers under the aspect of committing the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen driving a Renault Magnum truck, registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, and will be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied Romanians are in couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents say they are "very satisfied" and "satisfied" with the overall quality of their relationship.
"However, 18 percent said they were 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in their relationship, and another 18 percent said they were 'suitable,'" the study concluded, according to a statement issued Tuesday Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% fit, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
As for women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state (suitable), we see a difference of two percent.
"The same goes for the very dissatisfied situation, with the biggest difference being in the slightly dissatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that "Romanians feel the need for a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The survey was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1 on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe has once again shamed itself
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe had "embarrassed itself" after Monday's failure of a ministerial meeting in Brussels over the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
"Last night (Monday evening), Europe was once again embarrassed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told a news conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting urgently in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory distribution of 120,000 refugees, called last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migration crises since 1945.
He was mayor for only half an hour
The interim mayor of Tuzla commune in Constanta County enjoyed only half an hour of this position, because of DNA prosecutors.
Taner Resit had been appointed to lead the locality, replacing the former mayor, Constantin Micu, convicted of embezzlement, B1 TV reports.
The prefect of the county, Ion Constantin, waited for him at the institution's headquarters to make the official announcement at 16:00, but he did not arrive.
Reason?
Taner Resit had been summoned at 2 p.m. at DNA Constanta headquarters.
After two and a half hours of hearings, he was detained for 24 hours.
As a result, he was mayor for only 30 minutes.
According to prosecutors, he is accused of blackmailing a businessman between August 16 and September 8, in complicity with Stefan Radu, an employer who wanted to get 48,000 euros from him.
The two threatened the administrator, chased away customers, prevented them from entering his store, changed locks and seized the company's assets.
Moreover, on September 8, Stefan Radu allegedly beat the administrator in the presence of the deputy mayor.
Thousands of people passed by to put a candle on him
Thousands of people passed by the coffin with the lifeless body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people being no longer at Saint George Church except at the reconsecration of the church or at the Great Feast of Saint Nicholas, parish priest Emil Caramizaru said on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in line, stretching from the entrance of the church to the side streets, to pass by the catafalque on which lies the coffin with the lifeless body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
People wait about an hour to reach St. George the New Church, where groups of 40 people enter.
About 300 people per hour passed by the coffin with Corneliu Vadim Tudor's body on Wednesday.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came, starting Tuesday, to pay tribute to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people we had only at the 300-year reconsecration of the church and at the Great Feast of Saint Nicholas.
"Corneliu Vadim Tudor was at the 300-year reconsecration of the church and stood next to the members of the Holy Synod, His Beatitude Daniel and representatives of the five patriarchates who participated in the reconsecration," said Emil Caramizaru, parish priest of the church in Bucharest.
According to him, people came with flowers and candles in hand, they sit quietly and wait in line, as on a day of great religious celebration.
It is extraordinary the behavior of these people, they sit quietly, with dignity, children, the elderly, people on crutches, as if they were at a great religious celebration.
"It is touching to see them waiting to worship and pay their last respects to Vadim Tudor," said parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's family, the church will remain open on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, last night being closed at 01.00 and reopened in the morning, at 07.00.
He specified that on Thursday morning, at 10:00, in St. George Church, at kilometer 0, a short service will be officiated, after which the coffin with the lifeless body of Vadim Tudor will be transported to the civil Ghencea cemetery, where the funeral service will take place, a religious and military ceremony being officiated.
The parish priest pointed out that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 20.00, and then asked him to open the reliquary with the relics of St. Nicholas and remained to pray for minutes.
He came here very often, usually in the evening, after 20.00, asked me to open the reliquary with the relics of Saint Nicholas and prayed.
He said that this church of Brancoveanu is a great blessing.
He said to me: "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Michael the Brave, who brought the hand of Saint Nicholas".
"'You realize what a blessing for this country,' Vadim told me," the parish priest said.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor will be buried on Thursday, at the Ghencea Civil cemetery, with military honors.
The Senate leadership rejected on Tuesday the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's wife that the coffin with the body of the former senator be deposited in the lobby of the legislative chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on November 28, 1949, in Bucharest, was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Greater Romania Party, former member of the European Parliament and former senator.
What's going on with coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, as she has to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the Romanian only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the capricious athlete.
Adidas' schedule will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or walk away from the collaboration.
We don't yet know exactly what will happen.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, applying for a contract worth around a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last competition Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Tournament of Champions in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Pițurcă has revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last autumn.
The former coach confessed that he did not agree with FRF president Razvan Burleanu after he replaced Mircea Sandu and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
In the end, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary in order to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, I was leaving some work behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then, and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he finds out different opinions about me from the press.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at that time, with the results I had, plus there was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they really wanted me to stay, I then offered them a contract increase.
We have around 400-something thousand euros per year, I was going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, and he immediately took over Al Ittihad.
Armoured vehicles and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvees equipped with machine guns to the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday used water cannons and tear gas against migrants trying to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary erecting a barbed-wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will restore the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," said the prime minister's security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that Serbs have also increased their security forces at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the Roszke-Horgos border crossing for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to cut off migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he will erect one at the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the erection of a fence at the border with Croatia.
The rare disease from which a man suffers
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filmed him when he was dizzy, could barely keep on his feet and his words were difficult to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he had not consumed alcohol, it was visible that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks on his own, he's a secret alcoholic'," he said, according to the Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage of him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
"It was awful, I didn't remember anything."
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit, although the night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body makes all carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was his wife herself.
The disease does not yet have a cure, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick has not had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man wrecked his Mercedes S63 in protest at the service he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of service, BT reports.
The entire scene was filmed, and the clip ended up on the Internet, much to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed the car had malfunctions that endangered his life and that of his family.
His annoyance arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as they had agreed.
The Government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through in its efforts to modernize the immigration management process on national territory," according to a press release.
The strategy aims to efficiently manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action reflecting policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Taking into account the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on Romanian territory, generated by crisis situations of political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but, at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens coming from countries with migration potential or who may affect national security," adds the mentioned source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the stay of third-country citizens on Romanian territory and proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant for the transposition and implementation of general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to Romania for third-party citizens responding to employment needs, favoring third-country citizens' access to higher education institutions in Romania for fields and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the Action Plan for 2015, the Government considers that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon."
Romania, in a European top regarding the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among European Union member states in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data released on Wednesday by the European Statistics Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers' personnel costs.
Thus, between April and June 2015, total labour costs increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in terms of labor cost increase
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labor in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered an advance of 5.8% in the hourly labor cost.
TVR management's activity report rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Parliament's culture committees rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Company for 2014.
17 MPs voted to reject the report, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the joint Standing Bureaux.
They will decide, probably next week.
It will be debated at the next plenary meeting.
"I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairwoman of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for TVR management to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was common sense for the TVR management to be present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the members of the Board of Directors last night, with an approximate hour because we did not know the time either, but today, after the meeting of the Joint Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting it.
I believe that the moment you are summoned, you are a public employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint committees even if you do not like alive.
"Because it is your job obligation, you are in an institution subordinated to Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Joint Culture Committees.
He added that during the meeting, the financial aspects of the institution were discussed based on the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
We also saw the debts continue, they came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it was not my fault or that of anyone else in these committees that that agreement with banks and the tax office was lost, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenum, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and it will elect the director general of the institution.
I do not know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, through their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
They must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - common sense in their attitude towards employees because it is a pile of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you get 50, 60, 70 such referrals, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation which is a disaster," concluded the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee.
Although he did not attend Parliament, TVR President-CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, besides indexing the TV tax, amending and supplementing GD 978/2003 on the tax for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes up to date, as well as to regulate the procedure regarding the control in the field of TV tax payment and finding contraventions and applying sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become agents of SRTv for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
Stelian Tanase requests the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and of the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary allocations/financing for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - the World Cup, Golden Stag,  Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will default in the coming months given that labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce staff costs and TV production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News was closed," reads the letter of the TVR president.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by his own efforts alone.
"Without the support of state institutions – Government, Parliament, Presidency – the Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to fulfill its public mission," the letter reads.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office attached to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damage of approximately 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded in custody on May 22.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
Investigations revealed that, in order to evade the payment of taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in providing security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, fictitious purchases of services would have been recorded in the company's accounting, which, in reality, were not provided, thus prejudicing the state budget by approximately 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
Sheikhs determined Sanmartean's fate
The sheikhs of Al-Ittihad settled the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, the agent of entrepreneur Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match by match starter and does it well.
The sheikhs also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
It would have been possible to bring in another, much better player, but nothing came out.
"There were several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing materialized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president of the Court of Auditors
The Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as deputy chairman of the Audit Authority at the Court of Accounts.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
In fact, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they would challenge it at the CCR, given that he has a file with DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because his new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will occupy the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority at the Court of Accounts, left vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
With Bradley Cooper set to play a chef in Burnt, the actor made a revelation his fans weren't expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a chef."
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so he cooked with his Italian grandmother all his childhood, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type to make five-year plans, "not even two."
"It's not motivating at all for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd laugh at if I told you," he said, adding that what he wanted from childhood came true.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself directing in the near future, following the model of Clint Eastwood, who also took up directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday morning strongly condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's assertions that political decision-makers in Hungary are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, offends the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania's domestic politics," he added.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who he said "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to provocations from Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!"
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he advocates rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better policymakers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values – what we have seen in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "mere lies," saying they were inappropriate for a twenty-first-century leader.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and specified that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, that everyone who comes is a terrorist, they are Middle Ages nonsense, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can receive more, we will, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbours treat them, stick and insert.
"That's what I don't agree with," the head of the Romanian executive told a news conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for extending to the border with Romania the fence it is building at the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence solved nothing of the refugee problem and "took Hungary out of Europe."
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane in Mecca
Saudi authorities said Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partly responsible" for a crane crash on Friday on the Great Mosque of Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to an investigative committee, the company did not "comply with safety rules", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case is completed.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Grand Mosques to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday evening during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, collapsed on the east side of the roof of the Great Mosque of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut his opponents' mouths
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gică Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a poor coach who may not be able to perform in his new position.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he patronizes.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King proved that he is capable of transforming a team struggling to save itself from relegation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul registered, with Hagi as coach, 16 victories, 11 draws, and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, battling at European Cups.
Things took an even better turn for Viitorul this season, as the team reached second place in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
Viitorul also has the best attack in Ligue 1, with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared in the starting line-up.
The club's politics made Viitorul a team to watch for teams abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Together with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played like a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Large countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview for Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn history around.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council which, in fact, has solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All predictions said he had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very poorly integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there were rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's policy of openness, and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of "the EU sends migrants on our heads".
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of Members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits to the old Schengen system.
Perhaps we will abandon the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is hooded, you can't say forever that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if any.
Because one problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European countries will start picking up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
Perhaps it will lead to unique filtration centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
Solutions like this are being worked on.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase the xenophobic current.
What is certain is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are staying in precarious camps and who have only just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% managed to leave, in winter it is difficult to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave next year, maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it so catastrophically from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in the case of other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Great Britain.
But purely police means will not work.
Creating fortress Europe is illusory.
The mechanisms for integration into European societies must be addressed.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more demanding.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over values, not to have one foot left in Europe and one foot in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed in long-term integration does not mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come up with.
And if there is intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranged the rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we move around freely, but everyone has their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it cannot be so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run not much changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both ways.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we will go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country that thinks that if it pulls the cap on its eyes and plugs its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your small country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
As Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that Romanians' appetite for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says it's maybe good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its focus to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that to be a great power is to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For a couple of years there has been a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State came up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate matters, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates hotbeds of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are only great power if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made to him, for him to push buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don't come because people aren't convinced that he can solve issues of his own making.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" button.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive officer of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on his blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of how a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised concerns that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid moments when someone posts an important life event on his account and someone else will "Dislike."
Users of the network, which has grown to 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded to be able to express negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable liking that post," the Facebook representative said.
The option of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There was already enough hate on Facebook and social media," commented Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I will 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta-based microbiologist, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, noted that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands arriving en masse at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency earlier in the day in two counties along its border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing it would build a fence on its border with Romania.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" headquarters of the County Council is about to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here became insolvent during the works.
The headquarters of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up crumbling on its own.
A year and a half after the consolidation and refunctionalization works of the building should have been completed, the works have not reached even half.
A final stage in the building's saga occurred the other day, when the National Council for Solving Appeals (CNSC) rejected a complaint of the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works still to be executed.
The initial project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without publishing a participation notice with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project, and then a new tender for the works will be organized.
"However, the negotiations did not end in a contract, the CJ considering that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution", summarized Razvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at the CJ.
The CJ's decision to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iasi Court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final decision can another designer be considered.
Thus, the consolidation works of the building could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical design should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be appealed or not," Timofciuc said.
Work to consolidate the former headquarters of the Police Department began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works worth 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company became insolvent, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The works have been carried out so far at a rate of about 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalization and attic works of the building were valued at 7.7 million lei.
"That's it, I'll say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to admit the facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, led by the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office for Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi, accused by DNA in a corruption case, admitted his actions.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with intellectual forgery in continuous form and agreed to serve two years in prison with delay, as well as community service.
Regarding the facts imputed to Dascălu, prosecutors specified that he, as adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "falsely drew up several acceptance reports regarding the service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL,  SC Agency for Cadastre and Topography SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, which attested, unrealistically, that the contracted services were fully performed, given that they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. Iasi".
In recent days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to court in this case, the accusations being the settlement of services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The damage exceeds 300,000 lei.
Stone Age Adventures
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this it must pass two stages of pitchforks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are fantastic demands from Tomas Ryde's technical staff.
The staff will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants assistant coach, doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeping coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us for some things, namely physical training materials, that we had never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics. And I will do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, it is a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams we are fighting with have these materials and have had them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that they are trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to question a European Gymnastics Championships.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic quarters have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organization of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investments.
"In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they quickly clarified that the hall would never be built.
I also had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said they agreed and to invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare women's teams to reach the Final Four: "I asked all coaches to be reserved in their predictions, that if they do not come true they will turn against them."
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian squad are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to get two victories: "We are ready."
Both my colleagues and I are with our engines at full throttle.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are tough and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win against Canada, the match against Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the culmination of so many years of work.
I want not to disappoint anyone from the rugby family and to come home with good results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romanian national team coach Lynn Howells, at his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I am sure that the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's a great experience.
For me it is very important that at every match I make Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish success to the athletes and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romanian teams when they were 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to achieve a dream," said Dumitras.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: against France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition kicks off on Friday at London's Twickenham Stadium with the England vs Fiji match in Group A.
New courses of Japanese culture organized at "Al.I. Cuza"
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, ink painting, but also a light study about the fine arts specific to the Land of the Rising Sun you can learn at the courses organized by the students from Iasi.
The Japanese Culture Students Circle in Iasi organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumie and fine arts) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for both beginners and knowledgeable people.
They will take place at the Center for European Studies of "Al. I. Cuza" University of Iasi and are organized to promote Japanese, traditional and modern arts and culture.
For these there is a single participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
Apart from art lessons, participants will be able to take part in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses we proposed were conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"Interested persons will be able to learn how to make harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of ink painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the multifaceted universe of fine arts (graphic, drawing, painting)", said Sorin Mazilu, teacher of these courses.
The courses are addressed to all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations take place until September 30, and those who want to request more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studenticultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei given to "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi at budget rectification
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
St. Spiridon Hospital received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following the budget amendment.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement works of clinics, but also in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new CT computer, a new radiology device, six kits used for surgery, six properly equipped ICU beds, ophthalmogic microscope and other devices necessary for carrying out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement works of the "Great Burn".
From the money from the budget rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will make the reception of works at the walkway connecting the UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transport in decent conditions of the patient from the UPU to neighboring clinics", explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in its yard the Dermatology Clinic in Tătărași, which it will organize in an outpatient setting, in the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where outpatient allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located and will have approximately 30 beds.
Iasi, embarrassed by RATP controllers and a flyer.
A tourist's story
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither my wife nor I want to step foot in your city again.
Unwittingly, they ran into erroneous information in leaflets, callousness from RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says."
The spouses arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a leaflet listing the RATP routes.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Iasi.
But two days ago, while in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no ticket counter at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer existed.
Confident in the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to text the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers has emerged.
They said that the service had not existed for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it had been canceled.
HOW DO I KNOW what was written in the local press, me coming the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of 2 (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day by sitting at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!", says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the leaflet and controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It is not correct, and I made a complaint to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's NOT about money, it's not too much, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of the seven rapists in Vaslui moved yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Iasi magistrates judged the first hearing in a non-public session in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the court hearing, one of the Iasi judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, filed a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate worked until this summer at the Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Criminal Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted an appeal filed by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest.
Currently, the case is judged by a panel that includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, judge Dan Anton also abstained in the case, on the grounds that his daughter is in a cohabitation relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges ruled that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
The youths will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next court hearing will take place at the Iasi Court of Appeal on October 6.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van carrying the rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Pacurari neighborhood, the car entering Iasi on the beltway.
The IVECO van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that had gone off Canta Street and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was driving from the end of Pacurari.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi via the Stables, then on the ring road.
They thus shortened the road by several kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport to pick up the detainees.
Shortly after, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Maximum Security Penitentiary in Iasi, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, guards surrounded the back of the cars and the detainees sped out, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles agreed amicably on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu, of the IPJ.
Great migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, loud and clear: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
Parasitized by thugs and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
Moreover, governments of all stripes have been unable to absorb European funds, build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent healthcare, pick up dirt on the streets, create honourably paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is handled.
First, we encounter the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of someone stealing his national being.
Finally, there is also the hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination for the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Likewise, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue and, relying strictly on the card of political correctness, demand peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But there is peace in Romania and even some foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time – but that doesn't stop tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as a stiff construction, divided and overwhelmed.
I was lamenting the fact that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but the EU does not have any plan for the future either.
And improvisations and threats don't help.
What's the use, then, of the EU, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed – the right to free movement – could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, however.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros per year to rent the Pogor Club.
The destination, basically, imposed
The concession tender covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of remaining closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a usable area of 134 sqm, on two levels of cellars.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary café, bookstore or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period when the public catering unit functioned in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance works were carried out as they are currently required during the operation of a building," reads the documentation related to the tender procedure.
The club's concession bids are expected by September 18.
Two brothers from Tomeşti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to hospital
Two 9-year-old and 11-year-old children from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to Saint Mary Hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A heartbreaking date.
At 20, she received a courageous gift: her biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the mists of the '90s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman from Iasi, now a blonde and beautiful girl, reunited the day before yesterday in Iasi with her biological parents from a village in the county.  After almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will turn 20 these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
"Ziarul de Iași", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporters' reporting, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in Ruginoasa, Iasi, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," Alina, the girl's biological mother, recalls angrily.
Crina was hospitalized together with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costică Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be permanently separated.
They couldn't find Crina at the hospital
After hospitalization, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it had been almost nine months since the girl had been in the hospital.
"She thought she was abandoned," says a niece of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but could not succeed.
They instantly fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife gave him life," Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us with a smile as he grasps the girl's frail hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me in court that she was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And I didn't have conditions to look for it.
We prayed to God that he would be well.
I thought about it all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities for us to walk, to find it.
"It's hard," Lily's biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
But even though the years passed, the parents from Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania", confesses a delighted Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the search started from just one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had only received one name, Balcan Costică, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Shortly after, I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there was a name in the locality.
Then they gave me some directions, but the person found was not the one I was looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, it took authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since each lived in a different locality.
We started the steps somewhere in March, and in June-July we finalized the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided to hold a first meeting in September," added Romica Ichim.
This past weekend, Alina and Costică saw their lost daughter for the first time in the hallways of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, shaking.
"To see your child after so many years, there is something", says a niece, who also came with Costică from Ruginoasa.
Lily's meeting with her mother and biological brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if she wants to return to him someday, in the village, she should come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and set up a household.
My mother is also emotional, crying, and hardly believes that something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought something like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking all these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
There are very high emotions.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep in touch," Alina, Lina's mother, tells us with big tears on her cheeks as she clutches a napkin.
In him she still hides tears of happiness, because soon she will see her daughter after such a bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days this month, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's sketched out a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to complain about.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say", confesses Crina.
The first family reunion in Iasi
In Union Square, under the sky of early autumn, the family from Ruginoasa unites their destiny again with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer divides borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of a restaurant in the center of Iasi, they easily passed.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first event of this kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I am glad to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with drug addicts.
But we are trying to give back to society something good.
"If I am asked for such an event, I will gladly do it", says with a smile Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling stories.
They're understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Truce with guns at the foot yesterday at PSD.
Everyone draws their soul
The camps in the Iasi branch of PSD concluded a truce with a gun at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Iasi Social Democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have only paused to allow the combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He sent a very simple and very timely message in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the Iasi branch of the party are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazăr, County Councilor Vasile Cateea and interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One option considered is also the candidacy of the leader of PSD county councilors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu no longer joins the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidacies can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Bureau, a new County Permanent Bureau and all new management structures," said Catea.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, and the preparation of the elections will practically be ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached to support a unified team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Iasi, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A judge from Iasi refused the case of rapists from Vaslui on grounds of cohabitation
The seven young men from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The citizens sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments regarding their release, after the court of first instance, the Vaslui Court, established their incarceration immediately after the sentencing.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the partner of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest punishment in this case.
How the judges motivated the sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate from the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In his reasoning, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public opinion.
"The court notes that after being placed under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of liberty but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are being tried under a less restrictive measure",  is shown in the motivation of the Vaslui Court.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who, during the trial, invoked the fact that the girl they raped was not a "church door".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the aggrieved person is irrelevant, which the defendants wished to highlight in their defences, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Until Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder to what extent it can affect us to elect a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is Labour's most radical leftist leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once called on Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was regularly invited to comment on political events by the "Russia Today" television channel), and of the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas,  he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a tragedy at the time, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the example of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he came face to face with the real world and economic laws.
The new Labour leader's economic programme includes, among other things, massive renationalisations and money printing as a solution to finance development projects and cover very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have a general world prosperity!, but who would stumble upon such details.
Sure, we can tax the bankers to blood, who have become a kind of enemies of the left, but from what we have seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra money is quickly swallowed up by the generous, empty promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher aptly pointed out, "The problem with socialism is that at some point other people's money runs out."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early '80s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his convictions as the party's new leader anyway, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were noticeably more influential than they are now.
With the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce as a whole and extensive automation has made industry massively need highly skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit and Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and look at the refugee crisis shaking the foundations of the EU, you end up with an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide, following the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so since, for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which, however, Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
True, British business, the City, are strong advocates of the country remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the Europe of the past.
There is a lot of resentment, which is growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening at a time when electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration parties that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
Hence the conclusion drawn by the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that starts from the national interest.
If voters make the cerebral decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we witness a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both provoked by hasty decisions that took into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may majorly affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to rule anything out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard about all over the world.
But behind its fame hides something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something also has a name.
It's called "toil."
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, really?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertisement.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
Incidentally, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with his child, he hears the following instructions: "We are going to the park, to Brancusi".
The country is studded with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the communists failed to extirpate him from Romania's memory and culture.
His quotes are all over the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what more is there to say, write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in some big city and a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps this is where the text that follows should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the cretinous success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, the whole world has heard of him?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in Piscesani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brancusi led a modest life, but one from which he would collect the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist confessed, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, in Paris, in 1933: "Back then, life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people happily led patriarchal lives.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the big city has come down to us.
However, Brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native locality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancusi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when brandy was being made "in the cauldron", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process goes well, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with brandy and drinks breathlessly.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then hysteria, believing that her son is dead.
Towards evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by fiddlers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him breathlessly.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brândușa, a servant and servant of the Brancusi.
The crocus checks the baby's breathing, then puts horse dung gathered from around him under his nose.
The child sneezes heavily.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep drunk for joy, the fiddler party continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brâncuși asks Constantin to collect some rods and bring them to him.
The father places his child upside down and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, whether the star itself participated in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
Currently, the city is not functioning
An MP appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop fighting and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that's it.
I haven't seen any of USL's 2012 projects continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside a bit, get together and talk.
Currently, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with internal warfare, you don't have time for those who elected you," Blăjuț said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the Iasi electorate, the consequence of which will be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
Also, the MP believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing reservation towards new political initiatives, such as the party "Pentru Iași" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the electorate of the right, not from that of the PSD.
Such parties rely on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is crumbling even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for PSD," Blăjuț said.
He said he was not interested in running in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I've said before that I don't want to run for any local office.
I am also considering whether to continue as an MP in the next mandate.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi in the hallway discussions with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they are stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blăjuț, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected officials.
A colleague from Tătărași said that his money was not enough and he had to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
There is little money.
Sometimes I am ashamed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of my mandate, I will report on everything I have spent, except for the salaries of the cabinet employees and its maintenance.
I happened to raise 30,000 lei in one month, with all the transport, accommodation and other reimbursements.
"To say an MP doesn't have enough money is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuț concluded.
