Even though an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate of Ebola, so far it has not been clearly demonstrated that there are adequate drugs to treat an existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had less benefit in preventing death than desired.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the USA Olympic Committee&#39;s letter and accepts the Olympic family&#39;s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC&#39;s statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they play, can be better served by implementing significant changes to our organization than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse of the proportions so bravely described by those abused by Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long, and supports any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and supportive environment.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, an already widely held hypothesis, but provides details that are generally not obtainable from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on the upper part, with a light or orange color on the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but showed other characteristic elements of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that arose after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or impressment. The researchers suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.
The governor&#39;s office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant to be responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star&#39;s Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
&quot;In an interview, he stated that the new variant is &#39;very disturbing and worrying because of the very high death rate.&#39;&quot;
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll claims, and at least 2 were hospital staff.
During a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood of these being caves.
&quot;They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground,&quot; said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed slip of paper indicating which candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned and Ed Davey is to take his place in Cabinet. Norman Lamb is expected to take over as Business Minister, vacated by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered arm and jaw injuries and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka&#39;s gun malfunctioned while aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, blind in one eye, missing a section of his skull and having his face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider&#39;s testimony was taken via video link from a USAF base located in his home country.
After Wednesday&#39;s event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first event he participated in was the slalom, where he did not reach the finish line on the first attempt. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women&#39;s sitting group with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first finisher, Australia&#39;s Claudia Loesch, and 1 :09.02 minutes behind ninth place competitor Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women&#39;s sitting event failed to finish their lap, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to secure a place in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
&quot;Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, &#39;We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop.&#39;&quot;
The accused are identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with his son&#39;s murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other areas of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have ruled that publishing photos can be harmful.
&quot;Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that &#39;journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects&#39;.&quot;
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters it would make no further comment at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn up based on borders from before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred site for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, with the test monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Sport Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Hunters Association&#39;s hunting program.
According to Mick O&#39;Flynn, NPWS Executive Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety briefing and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), made up of nine members.
It is Martelly&#39;s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly&#39;s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
&quot;Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were &#39;not serious&#39;.&quot;
&quot;The ministry responded, saying Apple&#39;s delay was &#39;truly regrettable&#39;.&quot;
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippine state.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women&#39;s Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two &quot;black box&quot; flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
&quot;Tommy Dreamer said that &#39;Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night two months ago. A unique moment, just like she was. A strong woman.&quot;
&quot;Dustin Runnels, nicknamed &#39;Gold Dust&#39;, commented that &#39;Luna was just as eccentric as me... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she&#39;s somewhere better&quot;.&quot;
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II came to an end.
34% of those polled agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia&#39;s last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle as well as three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take pain medication, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before early February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of earth&#39;s water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as &quot;political chatter and nonsense&quot;.
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and relay more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley and car parks and parking facilities linked to public transport are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of means of transport brought into discussion the possibility of organizing the game behind closed doors, in the absence of the team&#39;s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on Ecuador&#39;s Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to breeding between endemic Darwin&#39;s finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of designs. Can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called &quot;illuminated manuscripts&quot;.
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form them into a ball.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Debris from sewage systems has been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women shared.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do so via a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth&#39;s atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the wheel gave us was to give us a much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap long distances, and shoot with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can rage.
The tiger&#39;s roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) with the help of smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move around undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot return back easily), will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, blow it out of their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Plus, they cast a shadow.
We make our houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that got in its way got off well.
We don&#39;t know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaur species, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have handled it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes that included wild boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called a porcupine.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets where they lay on their sides while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe, the Americas, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In Norse saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and as he traveled further west he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
But regardless of the discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all &quot;Scandinavian&quot; countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you&#39;ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
&quot;On the back of the declaration of independence you can read the words: &quot;Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776&quot;. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.&quot;
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is known that in its early days the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been kept rolled up.
So the marking was probably made simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
&quot;It was run by the French &quot;from Vichy&quot;. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them.”
&quot;On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called &#39;Operation Dragoon&#39;.&quot;
In just two weeks, American forces alongside Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of the society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural imprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its decisions.
He also had no authority to nullify laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is home to nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
&quot;Because of Japan&#39;s island groups, it is often said that Japan is geographically an &#39;archipelago.&#39;&quot;
The beginning of Taiwan took place long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on the sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size since the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by digital camera image sensor formats.
The somewhat confusing 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (eg the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was really followed.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between successive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting for the throne in the grand palace at Xi&#39;an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to be successful.
Likewise with the military, as instead of the military hierarchy being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave which came to be known as &#39;Hira&#39;, located on Mount &#39;Noor&#39; (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad&#39;s spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it&#39;s hard to find even when you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
&quot;The Giza Plateau, also called the &quot;Giza Necropolis&quot;, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples and the Great Sphinx.&quot;
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu&#39;s wives and family members.
&quot;The &#39;stroke up&#39; mark looks like a V, and the &#39;stroke down&#39; mark looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.&quot;
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (ie the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and draw the bow.
An upward bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more decisive.
Feel free to mark your own directions, but remember that the printed directions for bow features are there for musical reasons and should normally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king&#39;s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob made up of merchant women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in conquering the state of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that includes the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is governed by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
&quot;Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely independent of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has &#39;effects&#39; on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.&quot;
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which prompts the invention of new medical techniques to heal bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread by 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silks and spices more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that time was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds, native to the same ecological region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of society&#39;s standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of signature style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
&quot;Such children are called &#39;untamed&#39; or wild. Some feral children were seized by humans (usually by their own parents); In some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.&quot;
Feral children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; and others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
The feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or scaffolding method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software to prompt, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
There shouldn&#39;t be children growing up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe accommodation, caring carers, sound education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of the children, which were not covered in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Other distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;socializing&quot; are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
&quot;Personal involvement&quot; and &quot;ongoing relationships&quot; were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President&#39;s Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage still manage to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two gene pools at each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
&quot;Given all of this, it shouldn&#39;t surprise us if our ancestors solved the &#39;protein problem&#39; in a way similar to the savannah chimpanzees of today.&quot;
Sleep disruption is the procedure of intentionally waking up during a normal period of sleep in order to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to lull you into a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it across the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one&#39;s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and would be fought seriously, by &quot;delegated&quot; armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian beachhead.
But the plans were rendered useless almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army troops were mobilized to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Non-Aggression Pact -Polish, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people across oceans.
Traditionally, the navy&#39;s role has been to ensure a country&#39;s ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy&#39;s ability to move people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using especially submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them around the house for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the well-known sheep. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than could be done on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early, to hold the rails in place. However, gradually it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron caused the wooden wagon wheels to wear out more quickly.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans started walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was already bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement and even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don&#39;t just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of mankind.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap&#39;s printer a few blocks away.
&quot;During the night, between 150 and 200 copies, known as &#39;Dunlap posters&#39;, were made.&quot;
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the earliest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don&#39;t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many dinosaur-like features can still be seen in birds.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of two values, respectively 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term &quot;beetle&quot; is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient analogy with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidiculous, adapted to life in their host&#39;s nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their best interest nor in the best interest of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child&#39;s parents.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one though, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers mainly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle&#39;s ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase&#39;s experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments labeling either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural settings to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small country towns to go to their jobs, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow related to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its steady states that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
They all participate in society and use transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely seen in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such grievances, why do they fail day in and day out? Could it be because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of leaders tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don&#39;t feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being six miles wide in places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates the water of thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the day-to-day language used by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since ancient times some basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
Rather, it was reminiscent of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will find that some alloys may also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, trillions could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing instruments appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to pick up a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no momentum.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the near part and 100 km in the far part.
It is thinner under seas and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There may be more maria on the nearside because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people&#39;s attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg&#39;s Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers start managing former colleagues. One extreme consists in trying to remain &quot;one of the boys&quot; (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they need to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they belong to.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The &quot;invisible team&quot; is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works as a unit to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology represent physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows narrowing down the research area and defining it with greater precision.
Correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in some personal computer software applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often a teacher would enjoy taking their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve a student&#39;s written expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the gift of turning things around.
Since college students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
&quot;Also, blogging &#39;forces students to be more aware of the world around them.&#39; The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
&quot;Appropriate use of blogs&quot; can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues» (Oravec, 2002).&quot;
Ottawa is Canada&#39;s charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada&#39;s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka District and more.
These and more highlight Ontario as representative of what outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the US is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It&#39;s good to wear a wedding ring, but don&#39;t make it look expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when turning down a man and don&#39;t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of sundries, but it&#39;s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the extreme east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside of the city an outreach effort is required to understand the stage of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price of a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
&quot;Along with its relative inaccessibility, &#39;Timbuktu&#39; has come to be used metaphorically with the meaning of exotic, remote places.&quot;
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates&#39; PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country&#39;s cities, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the country&#39;s national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are park entrance and daily conservation fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa&#39;s national parks.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong is given by the island of Hong Kong and it is the place that many tourists look at as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to Hong Kong&#39;s skyline has been likened to a glowing bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the water to Kowloon.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British settlers appropriated, so for those looking for evidence of the area&#39;s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren&#39;t just mangrove swamps, though—they also comprise some of the last holdouts of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar / Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l&#39;Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two piers rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The free height to pass under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous population group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
&quot;Paraguay, formerly called the &#39;Gigantic Province of the Indies&#39;, was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups.&quot;
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has struggled to preserve much of its indigenous identity and specificity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although they will probably accept British and American currency; contact the owners ahead of time to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity combine to make the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
&quot;There are no particularly &#39;rainy&#39; or &#39;dry&#39; seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.&quot;
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile it may seem, bison, elk, bear and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so it&#39;s good to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches thanks to Auckland being between two harbours. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor District), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes busy family beaches with a wide range of shops lined up along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is &quot;Number One&quot;; not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called &quot;Manta&quot;.
Many French wines can be found, but New Zealand or Australian wines would work better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you&#39;re concerned you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of &quot;flat white&quot; coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is &quot;espresso&quot;, cappuccino comes full of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are pricey, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year and injuries from either cause are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can occasionally be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodations.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (eg visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees find this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you&#39;ll need to get there early to snag a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has finished, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be aware of the location of the cabin, as sailing through the ice produces unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time customers spend here and the money they spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have food, drink and entertainment specials to keep the mood going and guests staying in.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short space of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or sleet snow or condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa&#39;s main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those of the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
&quot;A walking safari (also called a ``bush walk&#39;&#39;, ``safari trek&#39;&#39; or ``on foot&#39;&#39;) consists of trekking, either for a few hours or a few days.&quot;
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, cancellation policies for coronavirus reasons did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don&#39;t have an iron handy or if you don&#39;t like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you&#39;re concerned, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who are going to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often crossing isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves prevail.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important that they are strictly observed.
However, oddly enough, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year and cherries and plums making an appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
&quot;A curry can be &#39;dry&#39; or &#39;liquid&#39; depending on the amount of liquid.&quot;
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used unqualifiedly, however, the term tends to indicate food native to the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider&#39;s legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
These provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety issues as it is possible for a rider&#39;s feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls out of the saddle but has one leg hanging from the stirrup, the horse can drag him along when it gallops. A number of precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stair straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling out of the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - Chile&#39;s most sought-after climbing spot, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes through walls with unlimited potential.
Down-snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
&quot;Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called &#39;ski bums&#39; in English, who organize their entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.&quot;
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have rock paintings of skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It&#39;s a related activity, but one that doesn&#39;t usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is conducted on much steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you&#39;ll be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot – but you&#39;ll rarely be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy pack on your back on groomed pistes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean repeatedly going through the procedures of obtaining a visa and passport control.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport control points.
In the same way, whoever has a Schengen visa does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
&quot;Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word &quot;Gypsy&quot; is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.&quot;
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their own citizens.
An example would be how American citizens from the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Tips are just a brief summary of a country&#39;s political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified manner compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
&quot;Extreme weather&quot; is a generic term used for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in the area as it could disrupt travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone to have professional training.
An Internet search for &quot;hostile environment course&quot; will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through hands-on experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are plentiful, but publications dealing with war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports with no gender declared (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through scans without having their privacy and dignity compromised.
Return currents are the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a fast current to the deep waters can form.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to make your way to a position where you&#39;re not trapped again, and depending on your skills and whether or not someone saw you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock manifests itself more quickly than culture shock (less of the honeymoon euphoria lingers), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
If you were to return home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the customs of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, aware that visiting a new country involves an adjustment process.
The world does not always expect that patience and understanding are also necessary towards travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence before the show starts.
You can usually hear the constant noise of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show looks straight out of a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by more countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km to the north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula&#39;s mountains come together to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km range of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4892m.
In isolated places with no phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally can&#39;t take the place of a cell phone because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including by pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require the remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people planning a gap year is to combine travel with study.
It is a particularly popular activity among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of staggered courses abroad can even increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
There is normally a tuition fee that is payable when enrolling in these educational programs.
&quot;Finland is a great place for rowing. &quot;The land of a thousand lakes&quot; also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.&quot;
In archipelagos and lakes you don&#39;t necessarily need a yacht.
Although offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland&#39;s national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This occurs in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise fairly unique (eg in the Netherlands the figure is 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several whole days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you&#39;re only going overland on shipboard excursions, you won&#39;t need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the city visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of: it&#39;s no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Delivery time is often of the essence when it comes to documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and the smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, it can take days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won&#39;t allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that&#39;s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a big wad of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your airline to do it for you).
It&#39;s not cheap though: you can generally expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge fares according to their requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
İzmir is Turkey&#39;s third largest city, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center situated around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, alongside glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls, feature traditional 18th-century red-tiled roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European feel to it. Mediterranean than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It&#39;s worth spending half an hour walking around this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became out of bounds following an enthusiastic review of its splendours by Lord Byron.
Scottburb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of the Holy Virgin of Fatima, a place known throughout the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world&#39;s population.
There are many men and women still alive who survived the internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are requested to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by drawing and scratching existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically all know Spanish.
However, most of the signs are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
&quot;Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is &quot;bien élevé&quot; (well-bred). It will help you handle things with a lot more ease.”
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and elevation levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide veils for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you&#39;ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with whatever condiments are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility that a verb or adjective can be used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, with most being pronounced exactly as written
The letters you need to be more careful with are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn&#39;t need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays and remain open as museums or educational sites.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that enjoy favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants look their best anywhere than in their natural environment, so don&#39;t be tempted to pick even &quot;just one&quot; of them.
If you&#39;re visiting a formal garden, collecting &quot;specimens&quot; will also get you kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily find your way around and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
&quot;But being in the &#39;upper tropics&#39;, just a few degrees north of the equator, you&#39;ll have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when it&#39;s clear, less often).&quot;
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake outdoors to watch the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of Holy Week, with congregations often meeting at midnight to celebrate Christ&#39;s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, with the result that the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution isn&#39;t often a problem, you&#39;ll be able to enjoy the stars, too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and co-workers address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, with emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to get their superiors&#39; approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors&#39; instructions without question.
