UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia&#39;s military support for Syria is that &quot;there is no military solution&quot; to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of five permanent members of the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly&#39;s ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions within the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers &quot;made this situation intractable.&quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they succeeded in reaching a deal on Iran&#39;s nuclear weapons, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a &quot;flip-flop&quot; politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn&#39;t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by double-digit percentages, and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul&#39;s nomination chances.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this is to say that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits show that at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry&#39;s lead was giving way to Herman Cain in the polls, but neither of them won any states in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush&#39;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are acknowledging Trump&#39;s power and are starting to back him with money.
Here are some numbers from recent surveys that suggest the real estate mogul isn&#39;t just a passing fad:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a favorable opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A Quinnipiac poll last week in Iowa found that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be &quot;thrilled&quot; or &quot;pleased&quot; if Trump won the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be &quot;upset&quot; if Trump won the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be &quot;enthusiastic&quot; versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
Closest in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;angry&quot; if front-runner Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don&#39;t see Trump&#39;s temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide think the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
We find the same numbers in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
Still, 44 percent don&#39;t think he has the personality to be effective, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the intellectual stance, Republican voters think Trump is genuine.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not been very good at reading the future in the past.
During the same period of the last election, four in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that a majority of GOP voters find Trump&#39;s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans folded to another candidate. Trump is still on top of it all.
Some say the split situation will likely contribute to Trump&#39;s victory, while anti-Trump support will split between more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a tie between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always have the support of the majority.
Trump is within 13 points of Carly Fiorina, 14 points of Marco Rubio, 15 points of Walker, 19 points of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points each of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He&#39;s almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup.
Most of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they are not changing their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump&#39;s top challenger is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they&#39;ve made up their minds are twice as likely to vote with Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot;rapists&quot; in his inaugural speech two months ago, immigration has been a central issue in the 2016 campaign.
Some worry that Trump&#39;s bombastic style will drive a wedge between key Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration, according to a Monday ABC/Post poll.
So it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
Six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government, according to an ABC/Post poll released Monday.
People are also angry with the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent saying they are &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent &quot;exasperated.&quot;
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister&#39;s Questions debut
Ever since his election, Mr Corbyn&#39;s debut at PMQs has been long-awaited
The new leader of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his Prime Minister&#39;s Questions debut, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely scrutinized by the media and Labor MPs.
In weekly appearances, he called for &quot;less drama and more facts&quot;.
He also stated that he may give up some participations and give them to his colleagues.
The showdown will be Mr Corbyn&#39;s first parliamentary test as leader, coming after what he called a &quot;ghost cabinet&quot; and his speech at the TUC&#39;s annual conference on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to remain silent during the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from Tory MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had &quot;respectfully remained silent&quot; and acknowledged &quot;the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain.&quot;
But a member of Mr Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC&#39;s Two&#39;s Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labor leader sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen shadow cabinet ministers refused to be part of Mr Corbyn&#39;s leadership team, citing differences of opinion on the economy, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
The BBC&#39;s political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are &quot;stacking up&quot; in the Labor Party after Mr Corbyn&#39;s appointment over his stance on the European Union and the benefits cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labor Party would introduce changes that would remove the idea of capping entirely.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Work and Pensions Minister, said the party &quot;is very clear&quot; in its exclusive opposition to the government&#39;s plans to cut the &quot;head&quot; level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader to face David Cameron on the podium in the past decade since he took over as the Conservative Party leader.
The Labor leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has &quot;outsourced&quot; ideas for questions to put to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said PMQs were too confrontational and he would refrain from retorts and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, would stand in for him at PMQs when he is unable to attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other peers to speak occasionally, saying he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss the matter.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron said he wanted to ditch the &#39;Punch and Judy&#39; style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader&#39;s judgment, how he runs the House of Commons and his standing with fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs a deep reformation.
&#39;Frame in Joburg&#39;: Homeless youth benefit from photography classes
It is difficult to be a homeless person in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take photos of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill says a rise in the UK minimum wage could mean &quot;more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.&quot;
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports&#39; expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the &quot;storm&quot; created around his friend Nick Kyrgios and his behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often dubbed the &quot;Special Ks,&quot; was uncomfortably dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios&#39; scandalous slip-up against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a tight qualifying match played soon after in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison declared: &quot;Wawrinka should have he&#39;s knocking Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked this kid down.&quot;
Although he was last seen making a racket after suffering muscle cramps and missing out on a possible US Open upset with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow where he is battling Sam Groth for the second singles spot behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
&quot;One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn into the conflict a little bit,&quot; Healy said.
It&#39;s true that he broke a racket when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he&#39;s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he doesn&#39;t would be proud of it.
But let&#39;s be serious, it handled itself extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He&#39;s got a great team, he&#39;s got a great family around him and I think he&#39;s been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has not had any conflict with the other players, he is well respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in great shape, he is a young very balanced and mature and I think it deserves to be judged solely on its merits and faults.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the main draw, which starts on Friday, and described the &quot;joint decision&quot; as the best fit for everyone, but backed the Canberra native&#39;s return in time long in the team.
&quot;First of all, we want the team to focus completely on the draw and not think about the [Kyrgios] controversy at all,&quot; Healy said.
And I think Nick has come up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he&#39;s maturing in the public eye and he&#39;s made some terrible mistakes and he deserves criticism, but we&#39;re trying to support him, we&#39;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs some time away from the spotlight to reflect, which is good for both the team and him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
With at least five months before the primary election begins, most Democratic voters say it&#39;s too early to say they&#39;ve made up their minds about which candidate to support.
But Clinton supporters are firmer in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
In a CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentage points.
Clinton maintains her lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
Support among men has shrunk considerably and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton&#39;s lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has an advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading Sanders by double-digit percentages among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead among liberals.
About half of Democratic voters nationally say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were chosen to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton&#39;s current supporters will be excited about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about front-runner Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open-ended question about why they want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it&#39;s time for a woman to be president ( 13%) and that he is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
Agreement on these matters and eligibility are also mentioned.
With the vice president mulling a possible run for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race — though a third think he shouldn&#39;t run.
When asked about their second choice for the party&#39;s representative, Democratic voters overwhelmingly nominate Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn&#39;t run.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate most likely to win the general election; but the numbers are down from 78% last month.
Biden is a distant second, but the percentage that says he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues over eligibility.
As of last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party&#39;s representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates fare well on several key characteristics relative to their party&#39;s primary voters.
Most voters view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as having integrity and trustworthiness, and as having solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton&#39;s strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don&#39;t think Clinton is trustworthy or honest, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% don&#39;t think so of him.
Democratic voters also generally view the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, as having the same ideologies as them.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton&#39;s use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their overall opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split on the subject in March, shortly after the matter came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say it has changed their opinion negatively.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their opinion of Clinton negatively.
Although Democratic voters view Clinton as having integrity and trustworthiness, that aspect continues to cause problems for her among voters overall: Only 32% view her as having integrity and trustworthiness, down 8% from last month and down 15% than in May.
62% of voters do not consider her to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationally do not consider Trump to be trustworthy or wholesome.
Still, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
Those who think Sanders has integrity outnumber those who don&#39;t, but as with Carson, many don&#39;t have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members indicted for killing first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in Pennsylvania&#39;s Pocono Mountains, five people have been charged with the murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, a 14 kg rucksack filled with sand was placed on his back and he was punched repeatedly as he tried to move towards a target on icy ground.
Mister. Deng complained of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity didn&#39;t call 911 after he passed out and claim they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity&#39;s national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
&quot;At this point, the members began to hide personal assets and basically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,&quot; Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
&quot;Too many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals,&quot; Douglas Fierberg, Deng&#39;s family attorney, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also face charges of outrage and complicity in murder.
&quot;We want to hold accountable not only the individuals involved, but if there is an organization that authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold them accountable,&quot; Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here&#39;s what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
This we know.
What we don&#39;t know is how soon it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers little indication of timing.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve&#39;s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That&#39;s why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should focus not on when interest rates start to rise, but on the trajectory of how long it will take for normalization.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at play.
But in the end, market players may find that all the interest rate hike hype has been overblown.
&quot;The Fed&#39;s first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the &#39;cheap money&#39; era,&quot; Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
Conversely, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here&#39;s how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has been dealing with in recent months, the prospect of a rate hike may volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
&quot;There appears to be a tendency for returns on equity to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the misphasing in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after Fed hikes.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading into rising interest rates, fairly invariant in the 250-day period following (2.6% average rise) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron&#39;s by Nuveen Asset Management&#39;s chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of interest rate hikes and benefits start to wane.
Recession is a fact of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its all-time low for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice has nominal GDP been less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect that to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question &quot;whether this time is different,&quot; Deutsche said.
Market players have been bracing all year for a hike decision from the Fed, with all eyes on this week&#39;s Federal Open Market Commission meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at this meeting, futures trades indicate a probability of just 25%.
&quot;In our post-1950 study, all interest rate hike cycles to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began,&quot; the report said.
On the contrary, this was an oddly slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this one has reached 74 months and counting.
Fixed income has also been volatile given that the market anticipates a rise in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first up/down in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe these rate hikes will cause short-term and long-term bond yields to converge, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds are doing better in such an environment, although &quot;we&#39;re still cautious about yield forcing,&quot; Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
&quot;In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in expected inflation, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, the spread of the average credit interest rate has widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mostly in the US will benefit from the rise in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
&quot;History shows that &#39;quality&#39; stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 interest rate hikes by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with both high equity returns and low-volatility stocks also outperformed peers with lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a major issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the dollar&#39;s rise.
Savers could also benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copycat of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Tory MP Andrew Bingham slammed the radio station for being &#39;stupid&#39;
It states that it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took a dig at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins hit out at The Voice, saying the show isn&#39;t original either
BBC Radio 3 is &quot;turning into&quot; Classic FM, a leading MP has said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations are not.
Tory MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was &quot;stupid&quot; and increasingly like its commercial rival.
&quot;I feel like Radio 3 is &#39;goofing off&#39; - although I don&#39;t like to use the word - but I feel like it&#39;s turning into Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be the Brits under another name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different - those are the two examples that come to mind that are just copying what&#39;s already in the market,&quot; Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director-general denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and audience education.
I won&#39;t find out about the classical music I find on Radio 3 anywhere.
And his commitment to live music and production is second to none.
&quot;Furthermore, I think Radio 3&#39;s commitment to discovering new music and the allocation of new tracks is also important,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said it had to work harder to attract audiences than before because Britons were less knowledgeable about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC-branded entity criticized at the Culture, Media and Sport committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has hit out at The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22m.
Do you understand why there is often talk of that show being unoriginal and unremarkable?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1-produced show - which has Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - would be made &quot;in a BBC way.&quot;
He added that he wants the said Corporation to &quot;find the hen that lays the golden eggs in its own yard&quot; the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to rule out future picks for new seasons of The Voice or spending the licensing money on other entertainment formats.
Online sales saw the smallest increase in August and Black Friday could be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to shop.
Specialists believe that Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain&#39;s high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs that online sales are slowing, with the latest figures showing growth of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000 to date, with growth of just 5% over the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are slowing, with the latest figures showing growth of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
&quot;If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using mobile phones to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that it&#39;s stagnating a bit, you might see a decline (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to get their hands on the deals, causing many retailers&#39; websites to crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers splurged for bargains, could cause shopper reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than going to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After Bin Laden Family Sanctioned, Muslims Bury Victims Killed in Mecca Crane Collapse
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were paraded through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health stated that a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the crane collapse
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane collapse at Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the journey to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after Saudi Arabia&#39;s king sanctioned the Bin Laden family&#39;s construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In the ceremony held in the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed crane at Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque.
Among the victims was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency&#39;s English-language service did not elaborate, but said the company&#39;s leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have flocked ahead of the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made a statement about the crane collapse and Group representatives could not be reached for comment.
The royal decree faulted the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate its work with meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has been carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a &quot;renegade&quot; son, disinherited from the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrive in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, a journey essential at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the dead victims will receive one million Saudi Riyals (£174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
Two offers have already appeared on the banking market to convert loans in Swiss francs into lei, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just finished the process regarding the conversion of loans in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data collected by the analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest in lei, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Banca Transilvania&#39;s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% on the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own clients, compared to the equivalent monthly payment in lei before the conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
BENEFITS
The main advantage of covering loans in CHF in lei is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the loan repayment will be made in the currency in which the salary is received.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no revaluation of the property, no additional guarantees are required and no further proof of income.
Practically, a new financial and legal analysis of the loan will not be made, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years consists mostly of interest, and the client repays very little of the principal.
Bancpost&#39;s offer with very low interest in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, the cost reduction is also lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, at over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may appear, not mentioned in the initial offer.
Interest rate decision time has arrived for the US Federal Reserve
The world&#39;s eyes are on the meeting scheduled in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made now believe the situation will hold for some time and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0- 0.25%.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,&quot; said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global situation.
It warned markets to brace for a rise but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), have been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor would have faced the problem of drug consumption and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw is out for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester United&#39;s Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the incident which brought tears to the player&#39;s eyes and will keep him sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had broken through PSV&#39;s defence.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then he will have surgery in Manchester.
It&#39;s terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, struggles, then plays fantastically and now something like this happens.
An oxygen mask was put on him in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I&#39;m not a doctor, but with a double fracture the rest is six months and he won&#39;t play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems Moreno was lucky to escape a red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it&#39;s a foul and a red card.
It was a very nasty, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw&#39;s Twitter account: &quot;Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how low I feel, I am starting the road to recovery, I will come back stronger.&quot;

The England defender has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championships in France next year in June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: &quot;It&#39;s a very bad injury.&quot;
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult for him because he didn&#39;t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it&#39;s a very serious injury, it&#39;s not good,&quot; said Cocu.
I didn&#39;t see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was going the other way, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn&#39;t see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it&#39;s like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so stupid, I&#39;m so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also ended up in hospital after being treated by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England&#39;s omission but is still holding strong
Victory against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task but after seeing England&#39;s squad for the tournament, I&#39;m not counting on a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat.
I wouldn&#39;t rule out an away win either.
Alastair Cook&#39;s team may be less experienced than three years ago but they have good spin players in the batting line-up and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a youthful positive attitude.
Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is unknown at Test level, is an option in the attack.

Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the squad.
He played the seven Test matches against two good batsmen in difficult conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I&#39;ve said this before - the players are their own selectors.
Fifty years or so and Lyth may have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire he will get other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not up to his ability, and I&#39;m not surprised by that; above all, he is a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman stands out in Test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton has been lucky at home and away.
The only gripe you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes into the team, a batsman I rate very well.
He is a cricketer who has the &#39;X-factor&#39; and we spotted him early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook has been mooted, which would take the extra spinner while retaining four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don&#39;t see why a pitcher couldn&#39;t hit there and this lefty has already proven he&#39;s screwed.
Moeen may not have brought success to his home county of Worcestershire, but he was no. 3 for these, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as first drop before coming into the open in 2001.
He promptly wiped out three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as back-up spinner and although I have had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think he&#39;s a punt, but there aren&#39;t a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tournament.
England have also made some changes to their coaching staff.
Appointing Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as Test match consultant could be a master stroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience as he has played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I have always believed that he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they convey messages that have been conveyed before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham&#39;s team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don&#39;t make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy remains stagnant through 2017
David Cameron&#39;s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more muddled by the day, even without Jeremy&#39;s brilliant &#39;Yes or No?&#39; Corbyn at the head of the Labor Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - immersed in crises similar to the one in the EU - not all of them being internally provoked - some member states are being fed the Great Britain&#39;s agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at their annual meeting, the TUC decided they didn&#39;t want it either if it eroded social protection.
We might even call it Dave and George&#39;s &#39;selfie&#39; diary.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It&#39;s just about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the EU roof - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us alone with France,&quot; Berlin declares - suggests that several obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don&#39;t care if stay or go
Angela Merkel, the ultra-cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her fortunes falter, as did Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the president of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It&#39;s hard to believe that these will help the posturing English, whose energy would be better spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don&#39;t want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
&quot;The renegotiation was fixed&quot; and &quot;Britain got nothing of value from the renegotiation&quot;.
Europeans know first hand how grasping Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are who view the EU with skepticism as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry into report 2 :1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who rose to fame in the early 1990s when he was Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-paying douchebags, phone-fraud foreigners and pseudo-nondoms who own most of the major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way, but he realized that when you&#39;re locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in his opposition to Cameron&#39;s referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which they provided an exit card.
The press did not forgive him for this either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him to stop wasting his time on me - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of co-operation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official position on Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most who disagree with the Tories&#39; &quot;Anglicism&quot; could agree with that.
That&#39;s what Hilary &quot;A Benn, but not a Bennite&quot; Benn said on radio and TV this week, as the scout in him struggled to keep from acknowledging that Corbyn&#39;s appointment of John McDonnell as &quot;shadow&quot; finance minister had was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labor colleagues without going too far and without losing his cabinet post.
Hilary&#39;s fight was more attractive.
But the fight to remain &quot;at all costs&quot; - Benn&#39;s phrase - does not match what McDonnell said, nor what the JC told peers and MPs in the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - mind you, he sensitized me too - message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favored ticket in Europe, allowing him to take Labor&#39;s support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has claimed.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn&#39;s basic sophistry about EU membership - consistent with their anti-capitalist background - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophistry - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters there - on concessions to Britain when it might all be futile?
The US is already quite disappointed with the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England regarding electronic cigarettes
A government agency&#39;s claims that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting between 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the &quot;landmark&quot; report last month and described it as a &quot;comprehensive analysis of the evidence.&quot;
But several researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the &quot;extraordinarily flimsy basis&quot; on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their substantiation &quot;on solid ground or quicksand&quot;.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: &quot;A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.&quot;
They said they expected PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking&quot; to be substantiated by a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to summarize their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It has also validated BAT&#39;s public health accreditation in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared funding received from an e-cigarette maker but not funding reported to have come from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but they include several well-known &quot;leaders&quot; in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
The head of the tobacco control section of PHE also attended the meeting.
The research paper produced by the group &quot;convincingly disguises&quot; the fact that there is a lack of &quot;robust evidence that most products are harmful by most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers&quot; are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health at PHE, says it has responded to claims in the BMJ in the past.
He stated: &quot;E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking&quot;
One in two people who have smoked all their lives will die from this habit.
All the evidence suggests that the health risk of e-cigarettes is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is and what is not from the evidence, particularly given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, around 80,000 people die from a smoking-related illness and the annual cost to the national health system of smoking is £2 billion.
By making clear the current evidence - that although e-cigarette use is not without risk, it is only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

The ads that shame Britain&#39;s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International&#39;s film against the arms deal.
Horrible killer drones!
Ankle crushing beasts!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause excruciating pain without leaving a mark!
The cheery voice and animated visuals leave no doubt that this ad for the world&#39;s biggest arms trade fair is a fierce charade by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities&#39; willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defense and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Center in London&#39;s Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed in bus stops and subways that need a second look.
&quot;Important announcement, are you traveling on DLR between 15th and 18th September?&quot; says one of the ads, using London Underground fonts and branding, with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
This September, a host of arms dealers will be pouncing on DLR Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are made by the artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum, in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London using &quot;Ad Space Hack Packs,&quot; a 6-pound package of Allen keys that it claims &quot;facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stops on the planet. &quot;
The London transport authority is not amused by this &quot;vandalism&quot; in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and looking to make political work accessible to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The Amnesty film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
VCCP&#39;s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the Arms Fair ad - with an empty slot in the ExCel calendar - and thought &quot;Let&#39;s give them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They toyed with making a more realistic ad but &quot;enriching it with animations and strong colors made it more striking&quot;.
&quot;They did a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,&quot; says Amnesty&#39;s Tom Davies.
Now, there would be a need for UK authorities to step up and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative form of arms fair-themed art comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic wares.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US military for the &quot;AT4CS RS with shoulder-mounted launcher.&quot;

Eight golden rules for dorm living
It&#39;s been 11 years since I moved into the dorm as a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed - and the many complaints about to others.
Most of what I&#39;ve learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into the dorm can bring on moods that range from nervousness to dread.
The chatter is tempting: telling people where you&#39;re from, if and where you spent a gap year from studying, what you think of Corbyn and why you &quot;honestly don&#39;t care about Marmite because, really, guys, it&#39;s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA you can find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
They liven up the conversation and help you differentiate between the people you like and the ones you wouldn&#39;t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones with boats.
Don&#39;t choke people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they&#39;re also where people get dressed and try on their underwear.

Introverts get special treatment at university.
Your bedroom is supposed to be a haven, but in many dorms, a bedroom culture is built on camaraderie, socializing, and friendships that last a lifetime.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to recharge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say &quot;I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to leave so I can recover the energy I used up interacting with you.&quot;
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try sending a text instead of knocking on the door.
When it comes to knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who lived in the same dorm as me had a policy that if a door wasn&#39;t locked, then he was invited in.
He has seen enough.
Make friends by cooking.
Since you&#39;re starting university in Bake-Off fever, knocking on someone&#39;s door to make acquaintances and bringing along a plate of black pudding seems less awkward, less 50s, &quot;Welcome to the neighborhood, I&#39;ve got you cooked something, now he smiles and I ask personal questions.&quot;
Homemade treats are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to chat and might end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a skilled cook.
Lumps of flour, sugar, and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Food theft is a common crime in student dormitories.
Obviously, if you kill someone&#39;s chicken it&#39;s theft, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is it still theft?
Ask the owner.
He&#39;ll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it&#39;s boiling on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it&#39;s annoying and I get it - still try to approach the problem more maturely than my roommate who dyed his milk with liquid detergent to punish the stealers.
He is now in prison.
Don&#39;t make noise that doesn&#39;t let others sleep or study.
That&#39;s not just because it&#39;s common sense, but because you&#39;re literally walking on shards.
A girl on the landing with me asked her neighbor to turn down the music because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to turn up the music.
When they finally turned off the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind enough to let them sleep for two hours before cranking up the music, locking the door, and leaving for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved into the same landing?
On the contrary, wouldn&#39;t it be extremely strange if you mistook a classmate for your future husband, hook up, break up, and have to see each other on a daily basis and maybe even watch him take over all the mutual friends?
Of course, you can&#39;t resist the heart - but if a sexy coworker is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
In the thrilling moment when you realize someone has left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between prank and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful prank is funny, but it can go awry in moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never litter someone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don&#39;t stick someone&#39;s belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach&#39;s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common, downright &quot;strange&quot; project, as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being indispensable.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the public another way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical music ensemble without a conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It&#39;s true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I&#39;m talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They are trained as &quot;specialized workers&quot;.
They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
Therefore, we are not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that cannot listen, but must watch, which is also stupid&quot;, considered David Grimal.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of &quot;musical disappointments&quot; in his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry as well.
10 years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I didn&#39;t find any sense to continue on this path.
Thus I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did such a thing without a conductor: &quot;The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects&quot;.
&quot;How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no longer any ego?&quot; asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces represents &quot;a luxury&quot;, specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ensemble&#39;s existence, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be an obstacle in the musical act: &quot;Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role&quot;, says Grimal, adding that at the Sunday performance &quot;there were 74 conductors on stage&quot;.
In Grimal&#39;s opinion, the Enescu Festival is a &quot;very brave one&quot;, precisely because it also invited Les Dissonances: &quot;An extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present and play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you also invited this strange group&quot;.
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu&#39;s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu&#39;s music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, &quot;because there was also a George Enescu who made French music&quot;.
Grimal advocates for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that &quot;the profession of musician, as it is organized today, has a death knell&quot; and that &quot;the future of music is music itself&quot;.
We don&#39;t need to go around the world 5 times a year if it serves no purpose.
There were no world tours in Bach&#39;s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: &quot;In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat&quot;.
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up at the service of supermarkets, as is also happening in France.
The same thing happens with music, it&#39;s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes that may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should come back to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music doesn&#39;t need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and this can be done by starting with educational policy.
&quot;If we considered - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would be no need to we sell musical by-products&quot;, believes Grimal.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, it is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier (this education - ed.) it must be in one way, if we want to train a musician, it is completely different.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?&quot;, asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this &quot;soldier&quot; status, overcoming what &quot;they think are their limits&quot;: &quot;Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and that&#39;s why they come out smiling after the concert&quot;.
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision on music and on the artist during the &quot;Festival of Ideas&quot;, a discussion with the public organized within the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques from Paris before the meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, during which he has regularly given concerts over the last 20 years on the main classical music stages of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchester de Paris, Orchester Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchester National de Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphoniker, New Japan Philharmonic, Orchester de l&#39;Opera de Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonia Varsovia, under conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schￃnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruￌhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of dedicated works from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing , Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
Besides his career as a solo artist, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom offered by the collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded &quot;L&#39;Autre Saison&quot;, a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the Saint-Leu church, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Dijon Opera.
He teaches violin at the Musikhochschule in Saarbrücken, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a member of the jury of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
He was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal plays on a Stradivarius, &quot;ex Roederer&quot; from 1710, but also on &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year&#39;s George Enescu International Festival together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, with Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven in the program.
Les Dissonances took the stage again on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed by Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for &quot;Little Big Voices&quot;
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: the dubbing of two characters from the blockbuster &quot;Snow White 3D&quot;
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous kid who loves movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of its newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for &quot;Little Big Voices&quot;, offering them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classic cartoons the focus was on the closeness of the actor&#39;s voice to the specifics of the animated character, recently, when creating the story, those who will interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enter their children in our competition.
They will have a special experience because the characters are likeable and the lines are funny.
&quot;The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors&quot;, said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is to access the micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register their child for the competition and prepare them for the voice test.
Afterwards, they have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record himself performing his dubbed version.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can be chosen by the contestants for supporting the test: &quot;Yellow Feathers 3D&quot;, &quot;Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D&quot;, &quot;Blinky Bill: Koala cel Poznan 3D&quot; and &quot;Albinuta Maya 3D&quot;.
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double a character each from the superproduction &quot;The Snow Queen - Crăiasa Zăpezii 3D&quot;, which will premiere in Romania in November of this year .
FedEx Earnings Mixed, Lowers Fiscal 2016 Forecast
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter, with the delivery giant cutting full-year profit estimates due to weak demand for shipping services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Around the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company&#39;s shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from a previous estimate.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower estimate comes despite a 4.9 percent average price increase that took effect Jan. 4 and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages that will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow from a year earlier as a result of cost-cutting, higher revenue and the development of online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that &quot;the company is experiencing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly with respect to global manufacturing and trade.&quot;
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of hires it made last year.
In the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks had estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnant revenue for its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping jumped the FedEx Ground division&#39;s results.
In the last quarter, the ground division&#39;s revenue increased by 29%, but operating income practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw an increase in revenue due to higher base fares, while the revenue recorded by the freight division declined due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5%, at $150.15.
At Tuesday&#39;s close, they were down 11% year-to-date and 17% from their June 11 record high.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank&#39;s boardroom, a mural of the United States will loom.
The map is meant to remind Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues that the nation&#39;s economic interests must come first.
The Central Bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And that third task could be the X-factor in an all-too-anticipated decision on Tuesday that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be stripped of the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-term interest rates zero effective from the end of 2008.
Even though most data points to a strong growing economy, the recent jitters in global financial markets could spook Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark federal funds rate — even by just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot;Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and foremost things they&#39;ll be watching,&quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus as to what decision the Fed will take, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg expected an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing the likelihood of a hike is just 30 percent.
That would indicate a bear market if the Fed raises interest rates, unless policymakers soften the blow by promising that it will be a long time before the next hike.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The momentum was sparked by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research Group.
&quot;It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates at this point,&quot; Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do so, &quot;they would have to act deeply in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.&quot;
Other experts said a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed looked set to raise rates by 0.25 percent this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage earnings showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to miss the central bank&#39;s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy &quot;can handle higher rates and needs them given the strain on the labor market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to falter later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 percent below a record high reached in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has pulled back somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market jitters add to the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
&quot;Without what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more bullish at the meeting,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official. .
Now, he expects they&#39;ll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to go by after the events in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed&#39;s major interests, so it should practically not factor into its decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world&#39;s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might “tape” its monetary expansion sent tremors through global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly twinned, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret world economy.
Its decision-making process is &quot;more art than science,&quot; said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that &quot;the Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals.&quot;
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the decision-making body that supported the rate hike, offered the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis affecting Asia prompted the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, &quot;despite the limited identifiable implications for US growth,&quot; Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s interest rate-setting committee.
The last turbulent period is nowhere near that level, he said.
&quot;We certainly don&#39;t want to end up in a situation where we fear an interest rate hike because the markets are upset,&quot; said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until something changes about that, I don&#39;t think they should act prematurely.
Looking for an amazing market with a Thai twist?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it&#39;s in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop that offers an astounding array of fresh, frozen and dehydrated produce, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is also a car department in case you need to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the aisles.
If you get hungry from all that shopping, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor food court of the store (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several options of dishes that can be taken away.
What&#39;s in Stock: Need something - anything - Thai?
You can probably find it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai produce.
The meat portion is large and so is the fish - the serving staff will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you like.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer section, where you will find curry leaves, frozen melons and ginger, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, fish balls, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and many others.
Who buys there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The discovery: fresh durian fruits right next to the houses area.
Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area shared with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store is likely to get crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise dominates the polls despite Nine&#39;s attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about the party&#39;s leadership change
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson&#39;s emergency trip to Canberra to cover the fallout from the Liberal leadership changes did not bring a significant boost to Today&#39;s audience.
Channel Nine&#39;s morning show broadcast from the capital following Tony Abbott&#39;s defeat by Malcolm Turnbull.
Rival show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This &quot;cruelty&quot; of distance didn&#39;t seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities, compared to Today&#39;s 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday&#39;s (317,000) and last Tuesday&#39;s (283,000) audiences but the figures were lower than last Thursday&#39;s (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise averaged 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only the Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could handle a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night gave a resounding yes.
Seven&#39;s X Factor held on with 1.136 million viewers, narrowly edging out The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had its ups and downs in its second night of airing The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new general culture show moderated by Andrew O&#39;Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5:30 to 6:00 p.m.) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a narrow victory over Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half saw a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Chase Australia&#39;s second-night viewership dip will give Nine tacit confidence that the Hot Seat will ultimately triumph at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire&#39;s show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia&#39;s richest man, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized and his pro-democracy efforts were curtailed.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds demonstrating against the country&#39;s proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to district police chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mister. Dhakal said police fired tear gas and fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in Nepal&#39;s southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces created under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes that broke out on August 10,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, a country ruled centrally for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and guns
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania&#39;s firm position towards the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or armed police.
&quot;It is a shame for Europe in the 21st century to apply methods from the 30s&quot;. declared Victor Ponta
&quot;The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and determined in the CSAT meeting on Thursday,&quot; concluded the Prime Minister.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery may be helpful in mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who undergo nonsurgical treatments.
&quot;It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,&quot; said obesity surgery specialist Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, uses various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body&#39;s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy -- in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes. in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who had surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of people who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained almost the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1 percent and partially cured in only 2 percent of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol &quot;were generally better in the surgery group,&quot; the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at around 8%.
But this improved &quot;glycemic control&quot; — reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. of 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study didn&#39;t show a survival benefit in patients who had the surgery, Blackstone said it&#39;s an optimistic look for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
&quot;That&#39;s where this paper is critical, because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,&quot; without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when a patient&#39;s BMI reaches 27-30.
&quot;I think we&#39;re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,&quot; she said.
I think once they&#39;ve accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it&#39;s extremely hard to get back to normal.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe&quot; - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call for an end to violence in the refugees&#39; home countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also pointed out that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he declared in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
&quot;Caring for a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but we must at the same time think of long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,&quot; he stressed.
Basically, we need to think of ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
Force never solved these problems,” he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush&#39;s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the violent response by the US set off an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and it generated unexpected consequences,&quot; the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who ingested hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, US poison control centers have reported an approximately 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of hand sanitizer ingestion in children under 12 years old reported to poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Kids have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids drink detergent on purpose and others do it to impress their friends or to answer challenges on social media.
YouTube shows videos of teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
The teenagers reportedly mixed the mouthwash with alcohol to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
&quot;A child doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s hurting them,&quot; Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (of hand sanitizer) are scented.
Strawberry, grape, orange flavored hand sanitizers are the most attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
&quot;It&#39;s very concentrated alcohol,&quot; Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand sanitizers in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, it&#39;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, ended up in the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the legal limit for an adult to be under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was stuttering and unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children&#39;s hospital for signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of the alcohol, Ritchey said.
&quot;It was terrifying,&quot; Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wipes or wipes and to keep hand sanitizer out of children&#39;s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities assumed the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three upstate New York fourth-graders plotted to poison their &quot;evil&quot; teacher by &quot;putting antibacterial products in the classroom,&quot; according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and it is forbidden in her classroom.
The police found the plan &quot;inconsequential&quot; and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

Griffiths dispels rumors of misunderstandings
There have been rumors of a rift at Celtic, which have been quashed by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team will not be under increased pressure as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don&#39;t think we feel the pressure, I think the players can&#39;t wait.
Scots&#39; absence from title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax&#39;s ambassador, said: &quot;In the Netherlands, they no longer broadcast the summary of Celtic&#39;s matches; why?&quot;
Because the Rangers aren&#39;t there.
Here, it is not just about the return of the Rangers.
There is talk of the Old Firm.
Both teams are being talked about together and that&#39;s where the interest is headed.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and it&#39;s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, now five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: &quot;Celtic have had spells before and they will recover.&quot;
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it&#39;s very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what&#39;s going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that&#39;s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton&#39;s caution on January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified a number of January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss said: &quot;The January transfer window is very different to the summer.&quot;
For players transferred in the summer, there is pre-season where they can be integrated, which you have seen this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players who are not needed.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has suggested he could retire when his Swans contract expires.
The 29-year-old has struggled with ankle problems for two years and was unable to make the trip to Wales in the summer.
Hearts take on SFA over Neilson&#39;s comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender&#39;s red card was then overturned - his third red card overturned in eight months.
Neilson stands by his statements, insisting: &quot;I didn&#39;t question integrity, I didn&#39;t comment on performance.&quot;
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee have been slammed after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
&quot;It was the derby and it was the excitement of the moment,&quot; said the striker, adding: &quot;Needless to say I&#39;m not going back to Tynecastle unless I&#39;m playing for Celtic.&quot;
Tannadice Board have confidence in Dundee United - Donnelly management
Simon Donnelly insists the Dundee United board still have confidence the management team will turn things around - but agrees the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We&#39;ll get the boys fit again,&quot; said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for the &#39;dirty win&#39; against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen must hang on desperately to Hamilton Accies for a seventh consecutive league win, which saw them move five points clear of Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half free-kick.
McInnes stated: &quot;There&#39;s not a team that&#39;s won anything, cup or league, that hasn&#39;t won games like that.&quot;
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it rises
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE in Scotland is unchanged at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of people out of work in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland&#39;s unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than the UK&#39;s 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 in the three-month period, with the number of people currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said: &quot;The authorities&#39; long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.&quot;
It&#39;s been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labor market, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I&#39;m witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, barring some late legal intervention, I will watch a man being sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I will be sitting in an observation room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary&#39;s execution room and watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I dread the idea.
So why should I?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It&#39;s true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can not do that.
I&#39;d be sitting next to Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends, plus I&#39;d developed my own bond with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can&#39;t be both a witness and a journalist, so I won&#39;t be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I&#39;ll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the inmate&#39;s story the way he wants it, gain access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he &quot;could have worded it better&quot;, but he still thinks they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn&#39;t tell me what to write and I wouldn&#39;t even if he asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I won&#39;t go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it is very likely that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the death penalty.
I think its execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from this perspective.
I can&#39;t claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
You will learn from me what it is like to watch a man I love die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to pull out of racing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw from racing immediately.
He launched an attack on Racing Victoria&#39;s stewards and integrity department, saying they were waging a personal campaign against him, with the final straw being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a race day treatment.
Moody told Fairfax Media he always tried to do what was best for racing and was put in a difficult position when it came to Lidari&#39;s positive cobalt test, for which he had no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words regarding the statements about the spies and did not want to look like the &quot;fox that cannot reach the grapes&quot;.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to say anything about that and I kept quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything just blows up,&quot; Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences and I will have to live with what I stated.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to give them the best.
The moment they start to believe that it doesn&#39;t happen like that, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point I will have to think about what I will do with my certification.
Moody previously dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
&quot;Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whose name I will say if asked - and offered to hire him to my stables to supply information about the activity there,&quot; Moody told Racing.com.
They obviously think I&#39;m a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to get me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew then and still know today.
Should I think it&#39;s personal?
Does the RVL need to start having a backbone and maybe hold people outside of trainers to account for what is going on in the industry?
Am I a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that&#39;s how others see it.
They may have to take my license and put me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I am making now may cause them to consider that option.
But I got to the point where I don&#39;t care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer&#39;s frustration grew with the long-running cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari and the ban leading him to say he could &quot;put his license on the table&quot;.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of unbeaten champion Black Caviar, branded the raceday treatment rule &quot;ridiculous&quot; after applying mud or clay poultices to horses&#39; legs, which breaks the rules.
It breaks the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this,&quot; he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race-day poultice treatment, which stewards have opened an investigation into.
It&#39;s a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
&quot;We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
A hit and run driver at the scene of an accident in Cobram has been arrested
Police have arrested a man following a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Freeway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives say that the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
A man in his 50s handed himself in to Shepparton police on Monday.
He will reportedly be charged with fleeing the scene of an accident, failure to render first aid and other traffic offenses.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at opponents over wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has labeled criticism of his team&#39;s tackling tactics as &quot;distorted topics&quot; brought up by the NRL&#39;s top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm players to &quot;slam&quot; his side in the Storm&#39;s nervy win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a light reference to the Storm after his side&#39;s qualifier win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a rugby league &quot;showcase&quot; and said that the two teams from Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of his team&#39;s tackling tactics and stated that the players were simply focusing on &quot;contact&quot; when tackling.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried the Storm would beat them.
&quot;And it doesn&#39;t stop there - I didn&#39;t hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven&#39;t changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, it&#39;s just that in the last six weeks we&#39;ve really put the emphasis on contact in tackles and that&#39;s how we&#39;ve changed it.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he&#39;s probably not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy took issue with Bennett&#39;s idea of &quot;enlivening the football&quot;, reminding his mentor that Bennett&#39;s St George-Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He made his point by comparing his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was,&quot; Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010 St George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he wasn&#39;t interested in them at all.
But now he has a squad that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially thanks to the speedy young midfielders.
That&#39;s the kind of game you want to make when you have players like that.
He made that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they are saying these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn&#39;t think of us when they thought of the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between the Storm and the Roosters was a tighter scoring contest compared to the match between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, haven&#39;t seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, does that mean thrilling game?
Or thrilling means taking breaks and not scoring?
For me there are plans.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at home in next Saturday&#39;s preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls&#39; phones to lure pedophiles into sending images
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images of children.
The girl later woke up and noticed the phone missing, which she found in Hogg&#39;s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked in his phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police viewed the five pictures and then analyzed computers found at the address and found &quot;disturbing&quot; Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to &quot;attract pedophiles&quot; on the internet before &quot;pretending to be a policeman to scare them&quot;.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Crown Court: “He stated that it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the searches on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about asking that person to send him more pictures.
He stated that he did it to entice.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see footage of rapes and murders.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on her phone she called her mum and was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
On June 14 last year, Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or taking indecent photographs of child subjects and breaching the conditions of his parole on January 25 this year and he did not appear before the court at the appearance on March 24 this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders&#39; register because it could be said the offense &quot;did not involve a significant sexual aspect&quot;.
Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October due to social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody pending appearances on other cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders&#39; register before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier in the year, Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s longest-serving leader, collapsed on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but the footage of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats threatening to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message was sent by a hidden number but it is titled &#39;death,&#39;&quot; he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe&#39;s speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was &quot;concerned&quot; about the threats sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company&#39;s restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the services sector.
This year. HP will split publicly into two companies, separating its PC and printer division from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected layoffs will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
&quot;These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure,&quot; said Meg Whitman, HP&#39;s president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new way of doing business,&quot; Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will &quot;focus on delivering unrivaled integrated solutions&quot; to businesses.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the object of activity in the production of electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was called the &quot;cradle of Silicon Valley&quot;, is being split.
HP went through a massive reorganization to accommodate the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world&#39;s second-largest computer maker and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in a steering have a better performance.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Series That Taught Us Important Lessons About Male Friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is glaring, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends &quot;with a healthy mood,&quot; their chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to be effective, it must first be accessible.
In this social media-dominated era of communication, where the emphasis is on style over substance, the immediacy of response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have redoubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, fun-loving and successful personality, even when in reality isolation reigns supreme.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn&#39;t buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it brought attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by their jobs but by their own personalities, which they showed through their interactions as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler&#39;s frequent hugs, the moments where they watch football in the cushy armchairs, and Ross&#39;s crush on Rachel came from knowing that men can relate to this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their sentiments.
As one social worker explained to me: ...&quot;my role listening to suicidal and depressed people has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.&quot;
Often people who call us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old adage of fending for yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when trying to provide more long-term psychological coping mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between the men.
As much as objective, outside intervention over the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you&#39;re attending Comedy Central&#39;s FriendsFest this weekend, with a full on-set rerun to celebrate, why not invite your friends over for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut on Tuesday to help PSG beat Swedish side Malmo.
Next we present you the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their part as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League group stage run with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut for PSG, putting the French champions ahead although they missed a number of chances before Cavani&#39;s goal in the minute secured the lead 61.
Coming into Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French side&#39;s aim is not only to qualify for the last 16 but also to improve their run to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc&#39;s men were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering a goal-scoring opportunity before being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his glittering career in 1999.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets up a comfortable gap over the next-placed teams, even if there are still areas we need to improve on throughout the season,&quot; declared Blanc.
It&#39;s a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury to make one of three changes to the Paris side&#39;s 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
When he joined from Manchester United last month, the Argentine attacking midfielder was tipped as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe and he proved it when he pounced on Marco Verratti&#39;s pass in behind the Malmo defense before slotting home an incredible shot over Johan Wiland in the far right corner of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to snap their fingers to victory, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team starters, a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, were a formidable opponent.
But their attack was unimpressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic&#39;s shot that went past Kevin Trapp&#39;s post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG&#39;s players slowed down a few times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after the restart.
However, Ibrahimovic proved much more adept at supporting his team-mates, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came late after an hour of the game, courtesy of Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic headed home Maxwell&#39;s cross.
That goal ended Malmo&#39;s hopes of leveling the scores and only a superb stop from close range by Wiland to deny David Luiz kept the final score level before new signing Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed in stoppage time.
Malmo&#39;s Norwegian coach Age Hareide later stated that PSG were a class above and that &quot;The last game we played in the Champions League was last December.&quot;
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sale

The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education unions did not reach any results, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from December 1, with payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November , or one of 20%, from December.

Today&#39;s Government proposal did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have reached the situation to convene the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today represents for us less than what we expected.
&quot;In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government, from last year, for the year 2016&quot;, said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have

The migrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned, on Tuesday, in the territorial waters of Turkey, after the boat they were in sank.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP informs, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish Coast Guard reported that it managed to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape the war and the hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 flight attendants, fired because they were too fat
The airline company Air India is firing approximately 130 stewards and stewardesses because they are overweight, the company announced at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was taken for security reasons and recent Government regulations, but critics say the measure is &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;shockingly sexist&quot;, writes The Washington Post.
The mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and busier flight attendants.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 80s, when Air India started using ideal weight and height charts.
In 2006, Air India fired new flight attendants who were deemed &quot;exceptionally overweight&quot;, as this fact &quot;can have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility required to perform emergency measures&quot;.
The flight attendants sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
&quot;All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed,&quot; explained a company spokesperson at the time.
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What a decision he made
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the financier of the champion decided to close the Football Academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The &quot;Paul Papp&quot; Academy will operate in the town of Dej, with young people from the locality waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about material things during training.
They must have only one concern: that of playing football as well as possible.
Technical details should not be their concern.
They must value their talent.
This is what the &#39;Paul Papp&#39; Football Academy wants to do.
&quot;I&#39;m also waiting for the mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them&quot;, said footballer Papp for dejeanul.ro.
Children up to 11 years of age are welcome at the Stella Defender Academy.
The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea declared on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understood that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If it is desired to formalize through a decision of the Congress, we will do this as well.
There will be no emotion about it.
&quot;There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the insecurity of the government or that would give someone the impression that someone from the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister,&quot; he said Dragnea at the end of the meeting of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
PSD announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta declared on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message should be given if the continuation of the government is desired or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for a position in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will weigh in on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
&quot;I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party&quot;, said Dragnea at the end of Tuesday&#39;s meeting of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy is related to his file, Dragnea said that he does not have this problem.
I don&#39;t have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce my candidacy or not when the date of the Congress is formally established.
&quot;It&#39;s the only motivation,&quot; said Dragnea.
The vast majority of social-democratic branches have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party&#39;s Executive Committee.

The two worked this year within the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the Romanian only at important tournaments.
Simona only had words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself on the capricious athlete.
However, the Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide if she will offer Cahill a consistent contract or if she will give up the collaboration.
We still don&#39;t know exactly what will happen.
We talk and see.
&quot;After Singapore I will be able to give an answer&quot;, confessed Simona during a press conference.

It wasn&#39;t normal, I wasn&#39;t respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he did not get along with the president of the FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
In the end, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary in order to stay, but he was refused.
At this moment, I&#39;m not sorry that I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, I was leaving a job behind.
That&#39;s how I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with the previous ones at the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn&#39;t know me, he found out different opinions about me from the press.
I didn&#39;t change because it was very difficult at that time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his mind too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they really wanted me to stay, I then proposed a contract extension.
We have around 400,000 euros a year, I was going to have around 600,000 euros.
I did not discuss with Burleanu, but with his right hand man.
&quot;He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group,&quot; Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Armored vehicles and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns to the border with Serbia, after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against immigrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite the fact that Hungary lifted a fence with barbed wire.
At least 20 policemen and two children were injured in the clashes, writes Russia Today.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.

The police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who were throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
The authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, asked Serbia to take measures against &quot;very aggressive&quot; immigrants from the common border.
There were reports that the Serbs had also increased their security forces at the border.
Following Wednesday&#39;s incidents, Budapest suspended the Roszke-Horgos border crossing for 30 days.

The rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family to be an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, he could barely stand and his words were difficult to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said that he had not consumed alcohol, it was visible that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without actually drinking, I thought she was crazy.
&quot;But friends and family thought &#39;maybe he&#39;s drinking alone, he&#39;s a secret alcoholic,&#39;&quot; he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw his wife&#39;s footage of him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply did not recognize himself: &quot;I was looking into my eyes and I was not there.&quot;
&quot;It was terrible, I didn&#39;t remember anything.&quot;
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick&#39;s breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think the most was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit, although the night before he had consumed only one the only beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, &quot;Auto-brewery syndrome&quot;.
Basically, his body causes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this could be Nick&#39;s illness was his wife.
The disease does not yet have a cure, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick has not had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest at the service he received from his dealer.
The man &quot;attacked&quot; his car with a golf club, causing enough damage to put the car out of service, reports BT.

On Wednesday, the government approved the &quot;National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018&quot; and the &quot;Action Plan for the current year&quot;, documents considered to be &quot;another stage that Romania is going through in the efforts to modernize the management process of immigration on the national territory&quot;, according to a press release.
The cited source shows that the strategy aims at the efficient management of the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at the European level, adapted to national realities.
Considering the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being considered for the unitary and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by natural crisis situations political, social, economic or military.
&quot;The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but, at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from states with migration potential or that may harm national security&quot;, adds the mentioned source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including the maintenance of the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, the maintenance of an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and increase in intensity of the Israeli armed conflict - Palestinian.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: the promotion of legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the stay of citizens of third countries on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the system national of asylum.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
Among them are: the facilitation of access to the territory of Romania for third-party citizens who meet the employment needs of the labor force, favoring the access of third-party citizens to higher education institutions in Romania for the fields and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents &quot;a means by which concrete activities are established to lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon&quot;.

He added that &quot;it was common sense&quot; for the TVR management to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense for the TVR management to be present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members as early as last night, about an hour ago because we didn&#39;t even know the time, but today, after the meeting of the reunited Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that the moment you are summoned, you being a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the assembled commissions even if you don&#39;t like coming.
&quot;Because it is your duty, you are in an institution subordinate to the Parliament&quot;, said Severin after the meeting of the Parliament&#39;s Culture Commissions.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the meeting based on the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
We also saw how the debts continued, he came up with the idea that this year they would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
&quot;I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these commissions that the agreement with the banks and the tax office was lost, there are clear management problems&quot;, Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the assembled plenary, there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, which will elect the director general of the institution.
I do not know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary session of the Parliament, by their vote, choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don&#39;t know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - good sense in his attitude towards employees because there is a pile of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
&quot;When you receive 50, 60, 70 notifications like this, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation, which is a disaster&quot;, concluded the president of the Culture Committee of the Senate.
Although he did not appear at the Parliament, the president-general director of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that the Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the independence economic and political aspects of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 regarding the tax for the public television service, in the sense of updating the provisions at the level of up-to-date technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the control procedure in the field of tax payment TV and the detection of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants the issuance of a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become trustees of SRTv for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from the receipts.
Stelian Tanase requests the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget allocations/financing for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will become unable to pay in the coming months, considering that the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration made constant efforts to reduce expenses with staff and TV production.
&quot;In this way, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July, the TVR News station was closed,&quot; the TVR president&#39;s letter states.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be fixed only by his own efforts.
&quot;Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will find itself, sooner or later, unable to fulfill its public mission&quot;, the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.
Vasile Blaga&#39;s son-in-law, sent to court
Vasile Blaga&#39;s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor&#39;s Office next to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damage of approximately 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded in custody on May 22.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga&#39;s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations showed that, in order to avoid paying taxes and fees to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, made up of several commercial companies, through which they would have been highlighted fictitious transactions.
&quot;Actually, fictitious purchases of services were recorded in the company&#39;s accounting, which, in reality, were not provided, thus the state budget was damaged by approximately 600,000 euros&quot;, explained the Romanian Police in a press release.
The sheikhs determined the fate of Sanmartean
Al-Ittihad club sheikhs have determined the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays as a starter match after match and does it well.
The Sheikhs also realized that he is the best and that it would be a mistake to give him up.
There would have been the option to bring another, much better player, but nothing came of it.
&quot;There were several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing materialized,&quot; Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice president at the Court of Accounts
The Parliament plenary voted, on Wednesday, to appoint PSD senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes &quot;for&quot; and 108 &quot;against&quot; were registered.
Voting was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals criticized the appointment of Sarbu in this position and announced that they will contest it at the CCR, given that he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD senator will occupy the position of vice president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts, left vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutionally.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a chef in the movie &quot;Burnt&quot;, the actor made a revelation that his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he stated that he grew up in the kitchen: &quot;I worked most of my life as a cook&quot;.
He revealed that he worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that later, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so he spent his entire childhood cooking with his Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reports.
Asked what future plans he had during that period, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the type of person to make plans for five years, &quot;not even two&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s not at all motivating for me to have a map,&quot; he said.
&quot;I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you&quot;, he also declared, but affirming that what he wanted since childhood has come true.
Having reached the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself directing in the near future, following the example of Clint Eastwood, who also started directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned, on Wednesday morning, the statements of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to which political decision-makers in Hungary are &quot;no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing&quot;.
&quot;Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, offends the whole of Hungary,&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
&quot;His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in internal politics in Romania,&quot; added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a post on Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that he wants to draw attention and sanction the behavior of some senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, &quot;are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union&quot;.
I do not want to respond to the challenges from some Hungarian government representatives.
&quot;They are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; both in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis!&quot; Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees are fleeing!
&quot;I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!&quot;, emphasized the head of the Romanian executive.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, qualified as &quot;simple lies&quot; the remarks of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding Hungary&#39;s management of the refugee crisis, appreciating that those statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the &quot;extremist and lying remarks&quot; of the Romanian prime minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I said and I always say is that I am against the xenophobic discourses, the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, they are fools from the Middle Ages and I am totally against this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as human beings, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the bat and the insertion.
&quot;I don&#39;t agree with that&quot;, said the head of the Romanian executive, in a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to the border with Romania, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta declared that Hungary&#39;s decision to erect a border fence does not solve the refugee problem and &quot;takes Hungary out of Europe&quot;.
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is &quot;partially responsible&quot; for the collapse of a crane, on Friday, in the Great Mosque of Mecca, an accident in which 107 people died.
According to an investigative commission, the company did not &quot;observe the safety rules&quot;, reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), BBC reports.
The directors of the company were banned from leaving the country until the completion of the investigation in this case.
Also, the company will be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden&#39;s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the former terrorist leader&#39;s brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque, in order to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, fell on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the mouths of the protestors
Considered by many people to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform well in his new position.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he patronizes.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to save itself from relegation into a top team.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul recorded, with Hagi as coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The record is one of a top team, which competes in European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Viitorul this season, as the team finished second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
Viitorul also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared in the starting team.
The club&#39;s policy made Viitorul a team to watch for teams from abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros ).
Along with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It&#39;s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can&#39;t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Romanian Center for European Policies.
In an interview given to Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: &quot;Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring&quot; .
But there are masses who have started and we cannot turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea&#39;s opinion, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: &quot;Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the current situation&quot;.
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, did not solve anything?
It is clear that the EC president, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote in the council.
All forecasts said that he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity was applied in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things were very little integrated in the field of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is applied, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes were there.
But they did not want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive matter, rejection reactions appeared even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel&#39;s opening policy and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of the type &quot;EU is sending migrants on our heads&quot;.
So they postponed it, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we will probably witness big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external Schengen border to the responsibility of the community agencies.
Greece&#39;s border with Turkey is also Germany&#39;s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants gave the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be abandoned, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they enter for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you cannot forever say that it is Greece&#39;s fault.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the reception effort?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they will be reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn&#39;t want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don&#39;t think that the European states will start taking migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
We will probably reach some unique filtering centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic trend.
It is certain that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are staying in precarious camps and who have just started to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% managed to leave, it&#39;s hard to cross the Mediterranean in winter, but next year we expect an even bigger wave.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it so catastrophically from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with less or more experience.
Do you think there is any place where the integration of large groups from a non-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebians in France, at the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I would not go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in the case of other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Great Britain.
But purely police means will not work.
To create a fortress Europe is illusory.
We must go to the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more demanding.
Let&#39;s ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people bring.
And if there will be an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, it does not mean that the country will be restored overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such no, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we move freely here and there, but everyone has their own problems.
In the face of such a wave, this cannot be done, because some countries cannot cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long term, not much changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It&#39;s a wave of public emotion that sets in in both directions.
And it is so unstable from one week to the next that you cannot make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, many bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And, then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don&#39;t think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks that if it pulls the cap over its eyes and plugs its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country&#39;s problem.
That&#39;s what we did, it&#39;s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can&#39;t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You are not, you do not play at the level of a large country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
As Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that Romanians&#39; appetite for Schengen will decrease a lot.
President Iohannis says that maybe it&#39;s good that I didn&#39;t enter already.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia turned its attention to Syria, no one died in Ukraine.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a behavior of frustrated power.
She believes that being a great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years there was a fight between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don&#39;t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you are a great power only if you also have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to push the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another issues created by him.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are held by an invisible hand.
Let&#39;s not see Putin stronger than he is.
Which button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have gotten used to the &quot;Like&quot; button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the &quot;Dislike&quot; button.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the &quot;Dislike&quot; button will show rather a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will &quot;Dislike&quot;.
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to &quot;Like&quot; current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
&quot;You may not feel comfortable liking that post,&quot; the Facebook representative pointed out.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
&quot;There&#39;s already enough hate on Facebook and social media,&quot; Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan commented on the New York Times&#39; Facebook page, where the article was posted.
&quot;I will give &#39;Dislike&#39; to the &#39;Dislike&#39; button&quot;, he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with the button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the &quot;Dislike&quot; button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of the thousands arriving at its southern border with Serbia, announced government advisor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said that they will seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
&quot;As you can see, this is totally different,&quot; said the Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The &quot;new&quot; seat of the County Council is about to fall.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are about to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here became insolvent during the works.
The County Council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri street will end up collapsing by itself.
A year and a half after the building&#39;s consolidation and refunctionalization works should have been completed, the works have not even reached half.
A final stage in the building&#39;s epic took place the other day, when the National Complaints Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the company that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for the works still to be executed.
The initial project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was going to update the technical project, and then a new tender for the works was to be organized.
&quot;However, the negotiations were not finalized through a contract, the CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution&quot;, summed up Răzvan Timofciuc, public relations representative within the CJ.
The decision of the CJ to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iași court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the decision of the CNSC to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can the finding of another designer be taken into account.
Thus, the work to consolidate the building could be resumed next year at the earliest.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, redoing the technical project should not take long, but we need to reach a contract.
&quot;We are waiting to see if the decision of the CNSC will be appealed or not,&quot; said Timofciuc.
The consolidation works of the former Police Headquarters started in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after 4.5 million lei of work had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company became insolvent, and this contract was also terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
About 50% of the work has been completed so far.
Initially, the building&#39;s consolidation, refunctionalization and attic work had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
&quot;Done, I say it all!&quot; - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Cadastre Office signed a plea agreement, in return for deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, led by the former head, Narciza Nedelcu
A councilor from the Cadastre and Real Estate Publicity Office (OCPI) Iași accused by the DNA in a corruption case admitted his facts.
The agreement regarding the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iași Court, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of continuing intellectual forgery and agreed to serve two years of suspended prison, as well as community service.
Regarding the facts imputed to Dascălu, the prosecutors specified that he, as an advisor to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, &quot;falsely drew up several minutes of acceptance, regarding the service contracts previously concluded by to OCPI Iași with the administrators of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agenția de Cadastre și Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, who attested, in an unrealistic way, to the fact that the contracted services were completed in full, under the conditions in which they were not carried out and were not submitted to OCPI Iași&quot;.
The past few days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to court in this case, the charges being the settlement of some services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The damage exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH president Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women&#39;s national handball team to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, declared, yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
Regarding Romania&#39;s national women&#39;s handball team, &quot;the main goal is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of pitchforks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament &quot;, Dedu also said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
A staff that will consist of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masseurs, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification some things, specifically physical training materials, which I have never heard of.
All this to reach the Olympic Games. and I will do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But that&#39;s the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
&quot;The teams that we are fighting have these materials and have had them for some time,&quot; said Dedu, who noted that they are trying to obtain the necessary funds to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don&#39;t have a gym in Bucharest.
It&#39;s an infrastructure issue and it&#39;s shameful to call a European Gymnastics Championship into question.
Let&#39;s not forget that in other corners of the world, entire Olympic districts have been built in the space of two years.
Before 1992, the current Barcelona Olympic area was a landfill, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organization of the 2012 Olympics was also a success from the investment point of view.
&quot;In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition&quot;, stated Dedu.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, but they quickly realized that the hall would never be built.
I also had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and to invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and after that we discuss concretely.
&quot;So we have all the openness, both at the EHF and the IHF, but we don&#39;t have the infrastructure,&quot; explained the FRH official.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women&#39;s teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: &quot;I asked all the coaches to be reserved in their predictions, because if they don&#39;t come true they will turn against them&quot;.
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players make their debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, declared, on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all the members of the Romanian team are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to achieve two victories: &quot;We are ready&quot;.
Both my colleagues and I are running our engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are difficult and ours is the same.
Let&#39;s take it easy, first with France and then we&#39;ll see.
But for sure, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the culmination of so many years of work.
I wish not to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and to come home with nice results.
&quot;We want you to be proud that some players, a small family as rugby is in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor,&quot; declared Macovei.
The selector of the Romanian national team, Lynn Howells, on his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: &quot;It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup&quot;.
I am sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
For me, it is very important that at every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that the Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the height of the event.
&quot;These boys started playing in Romania&#39;s teams at around 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, a group of friends, who set out to achieve a dream&quot;, declared Dumitraș.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: against France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland, on September 27 in London; with Canada on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition kicks off on Friday at London&#39;s Twickenham Stadium with England v Fiji in Group A.

14 million lei given to the &quot;St. Spiridon&quot; Hospital in Iași during the budget rectification
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The &quot;St. Spiridon&quot; hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget rectification, approximately 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use until the end of the year will be invested in modernization works and fitting out some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomographic computer, with a new radiology machine, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six appropriately equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary for carrying out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and development of the &quot;Marelui Ars&quot;.
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
&quot;In addition, in the coming days we will receive the work on the footbridge that connects the UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transport in decent conditions of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics&quot;, explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have the Dermatology Clinic in Tătărași in the courtyard, which it will organize as an outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where outpatient allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located and will have approximately 30 beds.
Iasi, made fun of by RATP controllers and a leaflet.
The blunder of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife want to ever step foot in your city again.
Unwittingly, they ran into the erroneous information in the leaflets, the callousness of RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine &quot;because that&#39;s what the law says&quot;.
The couple arrived in Iași a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were listed.
&quot;Armed&quot; with these maps, the couple visited Iasi.
But two days ago, being in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no ticket machine at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they can buy a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusting the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers showed up.
They said that the service did not exist for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
HOW SHOULD I KNOW what was written in the local press, coming the night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they don&#39;t care, it&#39;s none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said that all they can do is give us one fine instead of 2 (for me and my wife).
&quot;I paid, I didn&#39;t want to ruin my visit day by standing at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!&quot;, Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the inspectors who &quot;applied the law to blood&quot;.
It is not correct, and I filed a complaint with RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It&#39;s NOT about money, I&#39;m not overly big, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists from Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive detention
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui was moved, yesterday, to the Iași Court of Appeal.
The Iași magistrates tried the first term of court in a non-public session in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the court session, one of the judges from Iași to whom the file had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, submitted a request to abstain, which was accepted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Criminal Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted an appeal filed by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being judged by a panel that includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, judge Dan Anton also abstained, on the grounds that his daughter is in a cohabiting relationship with one of the rapists&#39; lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in preventive detention.
The youths will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next court term will be held at the Iași Court of Appeal on October 6.
Before arriving at the Iași Court of Appeal, the van transporting the rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iaşi on the beltway.
The Iveco van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that had left the Canta road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was traveling from the Păcurari end.
The car entered Iași here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași via Grajduri, then on the ring road.
They thus shortened the road by several kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrested called another transport to pick up the detainees.
In a short time, a car from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary was sent to the scene of the accident, which picked up the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the detainees sped out, two by two.
&quot;The incident was not reported to the Police, because the drivers of the two vehicles reached an amicable understanding regarding the damages that must be paid,&quot; said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Țăranu, from the IPJ.
The great migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and bluntly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project .
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extremely low.
I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by thugs and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of all colors have not been able to absorb European funds, build roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent healthcare, pick up litter from the streets, create decently paid jobs or -keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they are fleeing?
But what is especially surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first strike at the belligerent hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, who show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of stealing someone&#39;s national identity.
Finally, there is also the hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only cite the horrors of war as the reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination for the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrian, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be derided.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the migrants&#39; home countries.
But there is peace in Romania and even some foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union was revealed to us as an ankylosed, divided and outdated construction.
I was lamenting the fact that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but the EU does not have any future plan either.
And improvisations and threats do not help.
Then, what is the use of the EU, if the only advantage that the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees that cross the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. they will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros per year to rent Club Pogor.
The destination, practically, imposed
The tender for the concession covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful surface of 134 square meters, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts as destinations for the building only literary cafes, bookstores or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently exploit the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
&quot;The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of decay due to the fact that during the period in which the public catering unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently required on during the exploitation of a building&quot;, it is mentioned in the documentation related to the tender procedure.
Offers for the club&#39;s concession are expected by September 18.
Two brothers from Tomești swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old and 11-year-old children from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to the &quot;Sfânta Maria&quot; hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, according to doctors.
EXCLUSIVE: A date that breaks your heart.
At 20, he received a brave gift: his biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear circumstances, in the fog of the 90s, when she was only two months old, tiny, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was loosely regulated, a young Ieșeancă, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited the day before yesterday in Iasi with her biological parents from a village in the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will turn 20 these days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo thought of giving their beloved daughter an amazing and brave gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to get to know her unclear past.
&quot;Ziarul de Iași&quot;, which witnessed the efforts to find the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these encounters that practically break your heart.
The reporting of the reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
Crina&#39;s story begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, Iasi, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between the parents, and the mother had to leave the residence.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away from home.
He stopped the girl, and I haven&#39;t heard from her since.
&quot;When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late,&quot; recalls Alina, the girl&#39;s biological mother, sorrowfully.
Crina was hospitalized together with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and also then the girl&#39;s father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives would be separated for good.
They never found Crina at the hospital
After hospitalization, Crina&#39;s father went to work in another locality, and returned six months later.
In the meantime, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iași, and the father, when he returned, could not find her.
I think it had been almost nine months since the girl had been in the hospital.
&quot;She would have thought she was abandoned,&quot; says a niece of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child during all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection in Iași, which then gave her for care to the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but could not.
They immediately fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would permanently move with them to Italy.
The little girl was already almost two years old, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
&quot;As if my wife had given her life,&quot; Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us with a smile, while holding the girl&#39;s frail hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina&#39;s parents, Alina and Costică, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he did not receive any answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but in Iași the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the Court that she was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And I didn&#39;t have the conditions to look for it.
We prayed to God that it would be okay.
I thought about her all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
&quot;It&#39;s hard&quot;, Crina&#39;s biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
But, even if the years have passed, the parents from Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she comes from and that her past connects her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
&quot;I wanted to meet my parents from Romania&quot;, confesses Crina excitedly.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, chief commissioner Romică Ichim, director of the Iași Regional Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Center, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore&#39;s desire to find Crina&#39;s biological family.
And the searches started only from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had only received a name, Balcan Costică, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Shortly after, I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if the given name existed in the locality.
Then they gave me some directions, only that the person they found was not the one they were looking for.
&quot;In the end, it took about a month to find the girl&#39;s biological father,&quot; explains chief commissioner Romică Ichim.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costică and Alina, especially since each lived in a different locality.
We started the steps somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
&quot;Then we decided that a first meeting should take place in September&quot;, Romică Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costică saw their lost girl for the first time in the corridors of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could hardly control his tears, and his hands were constantly shaking.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn&#39;t even sleep.
He was still excited, shaking.
&quot;To see your child after so many years is something&quot;, a granddaughter tells us, she also came with Costică from Ruginoasa.
Crina&#39;s meeting with her mother and biological brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costică Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wants to return to his village, to come quietly: he can give her some sheep, goats , to find a boy from the village and start a household.
The mother is also emotional, she cries, and she can hardly believe that something like this could happen to her.
I&#39;m very nervous.
I didn&#39;t think something like this could happen.
I saw cases like this on TV, I kept thinking about it all these years, I hoped, but I didn&#39;t think that I could be like that too.
There are very big emotions.
If you could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
&quot;I hope we can keep a connection&quot;, says Alina, Crina&#39;s mother, with big tears on her cheeks, while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In it she still hides her tears, of happiness, because in a short time she will see her girl after such a bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days this month, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn&#39;t know what to expect, but she has a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to collect his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to complain about.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
&quot;I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say&quot;, confesses Crina.
The first family reunion in Iasi
In Piata Unirii, under the early autumn sky, the family from Ruginoasa reunites their destiny with their girl from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, she finished high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costică, her biological parents.
Borders or countries no longer separate them, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian restaurant owner in the center of Iași, they passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first organized event of this kind, with such an emotional charge, and I am glad that it was a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with drug users, drug addicts.
But we try to give something back to society.
&quot;If I will be asked again for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure,&quot; says smiling Romică Ichim, the director of the Iași Regional Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Center.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling a story.
It&#39;s understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the foot, yesterday, at PSD.
Everyone is holding their breath
The camps in the Iași branch of the PSD concluded a truce at gunpoint.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the executive president of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Iași social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from being over, the internal war in the party seems to have only taken a break to allow the combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3 we have party elections.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
&quot;Until then, we remain in the existing structure&quot;, said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing definite had been established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position from the Iași branch of the party are the secretary of state Maricel Popa, the senator Florin Constantinescu, the senator Sorin Lazăr, the county councilor Vasile Câtea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the Schitu Duca commune, Mihai Mihalache, could be added to them.
An option taken into account is the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councilors, Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources from within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of the last days is that of the former leader of the branch, mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, candidacies can be submitted even on election day, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
&quot;It is important that we remain united, and we will remain even after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new management structures,&quot; Câtea stated.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections will practically be ensured by the branch&#39;s executive secretary, county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to &quot;a partial consensus&quot;.
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
&quot;But, on the other hand, there are several options regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Iași, the list remains open&quot;, commented Stanciu.
A judge from Iași refused the file of the rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Iași Court of Appeal.
The people from Vaslui sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments regarding their release today, after the court of first instance, the Vaslui Court, established their incarceration immediately after the sentencing.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request to abstain, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants&#39; lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the biggest punishment in this case.
How the judges reasoned the sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate from the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men gave reasons for the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, specifying that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among public opinion.
&quot;The court finds that after being placed under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restricting freedom but not depriving freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation regarding the fact that people accused of serious crimes are tried under a less restrictive measure&quot;, the reasoning of the Vaslui Court states.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who, during the trial, invoked the fact that the girl they raped was not a &quot;church door&quot;.
&quot;The court emphasizes that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they formulated, since a person&#39;s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext&quot;, also specifies in the motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the past decades cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Until Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of Britain&#39;s Labor Party, many wonder how much the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labor leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also a regular guest to comment on political events by the TV channel &quot;Russia Today&quot;), and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
As with all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things of the type that Tsipras also said and promised in Greece until he faced the real world and economic legalities.
The new Labor leader&#39;s economic program foresees, among other things, massive renationalisations and money printing as a solution to finance development projects and cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might ask why the solution of printing money is not unanimously adopted around the world, we would then have a general world prosperity!, but who can stop at such details.
Sure, we can tax the bankers to the blood, they have become a kind of public enemy of the left, but as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand&#39;s and Hollande&#39;s mandates.
The additional sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, unhinged promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well pointed out, &quot;the problem with socialism is that at some point other people&#39;s money runs out.&quot;
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the new party leader anyway, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there was still a working class in Great Britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the overall workforce and extensive automation has created a massive need for highly skilled labor in industry, Corbyn&#39;s rhetoric has limited appeal.
But, even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn&#39;s election increases the chances of Brexit, i.e. the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labor leader was a consistent opponent of the country&#39;s membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep faults created within it by the Euro crisis and now by that of the refugees, between North and South , between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so since for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant actor anyway).
It&#39;s true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country remaining in the EU.
But today&#39;s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity in these very weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had a sample just recently in Jean Clude Junker&#39;s speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of member states by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening in conditions where the electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly throughout the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher heights than at any time in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that starts from the national interest.
If voters make the cerebral decision, then Britain will stay in the EU.
But Corbyn&#39;s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today&#39;s politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will witness a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of the interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuel their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the same way in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that took into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent , the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may greatly affect Romania&#39;s situation.
And it&#39;s hard to rule anything out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: &quot;How can I help you?&quot;
Brâncuși: &quot;Take and sweep the workshop!&quot;
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard about all over the world.
But behind his fame is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It&#39;s called &quot;toil&quot;.
What to write about Constantin Brâncusi?
What more is there to say, really?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And, recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Brâncusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Incidentally, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And, when he goes outside with the child, he hears the following instructions: &quot;Let&#39;s go to the park, to Brâncusi&quot;.
The country is studded with his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncusi&#39;s infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the communists did not manage to extirpate him from Romania&#39;s memory and culture.
His quotes litter the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And, then, again, what would be left to say, to write about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncusi&#39;s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that unless you were lucky enough to be born in a big city and into a somewhat wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brâncusi&#39;s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there&#39;s a key here.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they may be.
Forget the cretinous success stories that are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, the entire world has heard of him?
It&#39;s simple.
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That&#39;s what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in Peștişani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncusi.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncusi led a modest life, but one from which he would gather the landmarks that would guide his later artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, from Paris, in 1933: &quot;Back then life was beautiful and harmonious&quot;.
For millennia, people happily lived a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the big city has reached us.
However, Brâncusi&#39;s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor&#39;s years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work &quot;Brâncusi. A biography&quot;, written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the brandy was being made &quot;in the cauldron&quot;, watching those tasting the liquid to see if the process was going as it should, Brâncuși caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills the palm of his hand with brandy and drinks breathlessly.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then hysterics, believing her son is dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by fiddlers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their hearts in their mouths.
The party immediately turns to mourning.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brândușa, doftoroaia and servant of the Brâncuși.
Brânduša checks the child&#39;s breathing, then puts horse dung, collected nearby, under his nose.
The child sneezes loudly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep off his drunkenness, out of joy, the party with the fiddlers continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brâncusi asks Constantin to gather some sticks and bring them to him.
The father places his child upside down and, with the sticks brought by the boy, beats him to make him remember.
And, while feeling the sting of the blows, little Brâncusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, if the star itself was not participating in his disturbance.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At present, the city is not functioning
An MP appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
The independent deputy Viorel Blajuț appealed to PSD and PNL to stop the internal fights and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that&#39;s it.
I haven&#39;t seen any of the 2012 USL drafts continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.
Let&#39;s put politics aside for a bit, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not functioning.
&quot;If you are busy with the internal war, you don&#39;t have time for those who elected you&quot;, declared Blajuț.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the electorate from Iași, the consequence of which will be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, practically representing the loyal electorate of the parties.
Also, the deputy believes that the voters will still turn to the traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the &quot;For Iași&quot; party that will be launched today.
The local parties have very little chance and will only break away from the electorate of the right, not that of the PSD.
Such parties are based on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
&quot;The right is fragmenting even more, which is not good for anyone, not even PSD,&quot; Blajuț said.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying the rumors regarding his intention to enter the race for the Mayor.
I have also said that I do not want to run for any local office.
I am still thinking about whether to continue as a deputy in the next term.
I tried to appeal to the unity for Iași and in the discussions in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to create an image.
I don&#39;t want to, but we can&#39;t go on like this.
&quot;If people voted for us, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are stupid to vote for us if they don&#39;t see anything,&quot; said Blajuț, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected officials.
A colleague from Tătărași said that he doesn&#39;t have enough money and has to go by bus.
Let&#39;s not be hypocrites.
It&#39;s not a small amount of money.
Sometimes I&#39;m embarrassed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of the mandate, I will make a report with everything I spent, apart from the salaries of the cabinet employees and its maintenance.
I happened to raise 30,000 lei in one month, with all transport, accommodation and other bills.
&quot;For a parliamentarian to say that he doesn&#39;t have enough money is pure hypocrisy,&quot; concluded Blajuț.
