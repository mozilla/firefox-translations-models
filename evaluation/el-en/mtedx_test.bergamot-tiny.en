At the age of 12, it was the first time I had to deal with myself.
It was the year I started sports and changed school.
I was now a student of the music school of my city and I was completely at the age of puberty.
My classmates were talented children in a variety of occupations.
Others were playing music, others football and others were just better than me.
Or at least that's how I felt.
I felt that I am lagging behind in many areas in relation to my peers and in relation to what I had in mind that I can be and become in the future.
Think, I was overweight, shy and not at all popular.
This situation I didn't think I deserved it, which is why I started looking for ways to change it.
My first move was to Google, as we all do today, how to get better, smarter, how I can get the impressions in a company, and I continued doing all kinds of similar searches.
I started reading everyday books and self-improvement articles.
At some point I believed a very good choice in addition to the articles on the internet would be a book that would have a condensed knowledge of me.
And I went to a bookstore.
I was learning about techniques and methods that could help me improve and I was trying to apply them.
I studied the posture, the tone of the voice, the speed of speech, and sought to control the style of each conversation.
Somehow, as you understand, it was very difficult to do all this from scratch, suddenly, and to study all this at the same time and it was utopian to think that I would do so simply.
This is how I realized that the theory from practice was a long way away and somewhere there I began to believe that I will never get to where I want and with the disappointment in my face it grows.
And then, an event was to change my whole theory about life, and for quite a few things, at least as I perceived them for myself.
It was a simple suggestion from a teacher at my school, to take part in a big short film competition.
We took part and excelled in the best teams in the competition, and that was the moment when I realized something very important.
The day after success I asked us a few questions to myself.
What was it that made me feel happy and relieved when I made it? Why do I believe I can't pursue my dreams? Why should I be afraid to lose something I never had, and why the fear of defeat overshadows the fear of victory? What is it that I really seek from my life and what is my purpose?
Millions of people are born and die at the same time without any idea that we coexist or coexisted with them in the past for a period of time.
Millions of people have completely different ideas and perceptions and beliefs from us.
And there are also those people we consider rare and unique and we are happy and happy to be next to us.
But they and the rest and we all have one thing in common.
This time between birth and death we call life.
So life, as you all know, is not playing laugh, right?
Life is play, laugh, cry, claim, risk, win and lose.
Life, then, is a very big game and has many parameters and many rules.
Some of the rules we know them from the beginning and some other parameters and rules we learn them later playing this game.
A very important part in games is to set your own context and your own rules from the beginning so that you reach the desired result.
Essentially you have a goal you are trying to reach and succeed and this can only happen if you move properly.
But what is the right path that will lead you to the goal? There is probably no right path.
There's only the road you'll set.
And if the path you have set forth leads you to the goal, then your reward comes.
Does this scenario ring a thing? Hmm, that's about the case in our lives.
You see, the toys are connected and have been affected by life.
Many times we have thought that this is our last opportunity to succeed, we live with deadlines that others define for us, and this makes us afraid of failure, with the consequence that we often do wrong or sometimes not to act at all.
Imagine now what our lives would have been like if it had been affected by the games.
At first, there would be no fear of failure, because we all know that in games you always have a second chance.
Even when your lives and opportunities in your game are diminishing, you are able to increase them and make life and play last longer.
After all, what is the point of not doing the same in our lives? Every time we fail in something, we automatically raise our success rate in the next attempt.
If you think about that, it's great!
Another important element that we often find in games is time.
If you have noticed, usually, many games become no more difficult but faster.
This is actually the case.
For example, today, here, I could make a better speech in my own game, but the TEDx production set me a certain amount of time to speak, with the consequence that they make the game faster, not harder.
Because, then, we know that our time is limited in this game and the hourglass turns only once, we define our own degree of difficulty in relation to it.
Most of the time we think that it is either difficult enough for us or that we do not have time.
Think about it a little bit too.
We are bound by the same thing, considering it two differently.
This confusion often leads us to inactivity.
The way to get away from it is to have a clear purpose in our game and by extension in our lives.
Time is the only property we have.
It's that hourglass that when you turn it, you suddenly start to feel the pressure to act.
This is your key that helps you lock the door of inactivity.
And you have to lock it well because it will find many ways to escape in order to create confusion and seduce you.
So if you manage to believe and see life as a great game then you are very likely to locate your destination.
You will realize that you are the protagonist of this game and you will start looking for the rules you have to follow and all your potential opponents.
Then you will discover a very big gap.
There are no rules to follow and there are usually no opponents who want to beat you.
It's you, the deeds and the time.
What's in is your time and actions.
Even time is a human invention that you will never be able to understand, and when you find out this, you will understand that you are fighting completely on your own.
So all the burden falls on you and the actions you will do.
In decisions of secondary importance, it is useful to consider the pros and cons.
On critical issues, however, decisions will have to come from your heart.
Success is hidden within you.
So listen and feel your heart and let it show you this right strategy for your game.
Depend on a target and chase him.
If you succeed, you will enjoy the result.
If not, you will have enjoyed the journey.
In any case, you will have discovered, because it is worth risking, because it is worth claiming and why it is worth playing.
Those who have a "for" to live can withstand any "how" Nietzsche has said.
This is why we are all called to answer it.
The day you discover it will be the most important day of your life.
Look for inside yourself without fear and you will find it.
I found it a few years ago after a simple contest.
Now it's your turn.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
To put our economy back on a path of stable growth, it will have to change jobs half a million people.
That is, 10 to 20% of the workforce.
And when I say change jobs, I don't mean working more productively or more or more honestly or smarter.
I mean to change their object of activity.
Let’s see why.
If we divide the economy, the sectors of the economy into two categories: the left the non-marketable, i.e. those that cannot be offered from afar and therefore are not subject to international competition.
And on the right the marketable, i.e. the products that can be transported the industrial, or agricultural, services that can be offered to foreigners.
Tourism, shipping and various forms of technology marketable such as software.
The problem of our economy, the structural, beyond the fiscal, is that we have very few jobs on the right and comparatively than many left.
And to get back on our feet, hundreds of thousands of jobs must come from there, here.
Let's look at another category.
To divide them into sectors that need large and organized enterprises which means capital, hierarchies, etc. and those that can be done and are done today by micro-enterprises.
Those who talk about investments and hope that jobs will come with "investments" in quotes, actually hope that jobs will come in ready-made packages, here, above, to the big competitive companies well-designed, located, with their hierarchies and their equipment.
And indeed, the international pattern of an outward-looking economy is this.
The big industries, the big companies, rather in the competitive sectors, are the ones that make exports or those that prevent the large penetration of exports from the outside, defending the domestic market.
In us, this model cannot dominate.
And the reason is that our whole society, our whole institutional environment conspires so that we don't have many big businesses in the competitive sectors.
At the moment, not even 5% of the workforce works in big business up there.
And when I say big, they have more than 250 workers, not huge.
Not even 5%.
About 25% works in large organizations or in the state, and especially in the state, in the non-marketing sectors.
And 70% is the small and medium-sized economy.
And of that 70 percent, at least half are self-employed and farmers.
Therefore, the great adjustment we have to make is from the whole non-marketing sector and from the whole pool of the unemployed to create the jobs here, in the small, export-oriented economy.
Now, this is a trajectory that is not at all ordinary internationally.
We have no standards to copy.
We will have to create our own trajectory quite peculiar, quite Greek.
Greek households will succeed because they have some elements that do not exist in a very large area in the west.
First of all, the self-employed and small businessman has commerciality.
He knows how to manage receipts and payments.
He knows how to set up new jobs, that an executive of a large company in the west that has made his career in a hierarchy does not necessarily know.
Then there is the famous perilousity of the Greek family.
The different sources of income, some different assets, a field from here, some rent from there, one pension, the wife's salary in the public sector that is stable, etc. Because the research that has been done internationally, statistical surveys, on what are the main factors that convince someone to become an entrepreneur, to start a new job of his own, the most important factor statistically is to have a buttock, a small fortune, something.
This factor statistically is more important even than character data.
That is, if we have a risky spirit, etc. So I think that Greek households have all the elements to achieve this great shift that I talked about.
And so I don't think it's hard to imagine a philologist leaving the tutorial and going to tourism, or an engineer to go back to his family field and try something new, a new crop, - no innovation has been found for hobbest than I see - or 3 new technicians to design applications for the global digital economy, which some of the best ones have here today.
There will be too many obstacles.
And one of the biggest ones is the standards we carry in our heads.
The standards we carry in our heads will be one of the biggest obstacles, role models for what? For example, what is a good job.
For me, for my child.
Or what kind of business are the best businesses for the national economy.
In 1980, the dominant model, the Western model, was that development means industry.
And we the standards happen to... ...we don't work it rationally.
As Stelios would say, we import them.
There are dominant narratives western that fit the west but may not suit us.
Well, in '80 it said the dominant model: "growth means industry."
And that’s why Andreas Papandreou, the charismatic Andreas Papandreou, said at the time, if you remember: “We will not be the waiters of Europe.”
And it coloured tourism negatively for many years.
Imagine if he had said: "We want to be the hosts of all Europe."
To come here, to meet each other, to have fun, to be entertained, to seek.
How different account there would be about tourism.
Today, a dominant model says that development is infrastructure and organization.
And that's to some extent, some.
But for us, we must have a wise balance between it infrastructure and organization on the one hand and our own particular characteristics.
And to continue with an example, tourism.
The foreigners to come to an island of ours will land in Eleftherios Venizelos.
They will come into contact with an organized airport, which only major organizations and infrastructure and plans can have.
The top of the painting I was showing before.
But they're obviously not coming for the airport.
Then they will get into a boat, which if fast and clean, will make them reach their destination cheerful and rested.
And the ship obviously can only some big company work properly.
But it's not the reason why the ship is coming.
The reason they come is after they leave the boat on the island, what will they do there? They will go to the small business and rent a pig and start the adventures.
Okay, and they're gonna get here.
And they'll lie down here.
And they'll go after the company's fund and they'll pay here.
And in the afternoon they will go and buy honey that has been produced by another small business in its premises, which are these.
Well, the airport and boat are not our product, it's the channel to get to our products.
Which are the route with the pig, the beach, the tavern, etc. And this is what the little ones offer.
And to explain, I'm not saying that the little "Rooms to Let" are better than the big hotel units.
What I am saying is that, since we either do not want or we cannot have many large units, the success of tourism will be judged by the small professionals.
From how hospitable they are, how much they are inventive, how much they take care of the environment and how much they convince the customer to pay without feeling that they are being robbed.
So I think that the airport and the pig are a good parable for the whole of our development model.
We need the good infrastructure that only planning and great hierarchies and big capital can provide and in this we must not differ from the west.
We must have these standards.
But what will define our own place in the global economy, which will not be the same as the Germans or the Chinese, will be the small entrepreneurs who have to find ways to sell their products everywhere.
Where can we rely? Apart from the crops or tourism that we have natural advantages? There is a cliché that says: "To our young people, their intelligence and in their studies."
Because they are open-minded, they travel, they know languages, and many of them are studying at the best universities in the world.
This has some substance.
That is, based on these elements we can have some successes.
But I believe that not too many.
Where we can have more is if we combine these elements, intelligence and studies, with some local peculiarities, which I have to tell you, no one can tell you from a seat.
Not me or anyone else.
This is discovered by entrepreneurs every day, small businessmen from job to job.
And let me give an example.
The language learning books.
The so-called foreign-language books and especially of the English language.
I know at least 3 Greek publishers, who are very successful internationally.
One of them was bought last year by a multinational and the other two make significant exports.
From where and how far Greek publishers in English language learning.
We have the following peculiarity.
In most countries, children learn English at school and their books are taken either by large multinationals or by some domestic publishers, one or two with long-term contracts.
We here, we don't learn English at school.
We learn them in the tutorial where there are six thousand in Greece and each decides what books to get and re-decided next year.
So a very competitive market of publishers for English language learning has been created, which is about 15 at the moment and the most are domestic, they are Greek.
The other characteristic of Greece, the peculiarity again, is that Greek students want to have finished with English, with tutorials and exams at 16.
Because then the other tutorials, of the nationwide, must begin.
This creates a need for teaching methods that are more concise and quicker.
Faster than those developed by multinational publishers.
And so the Greek publishers, by clicking on this peculiarity, made products that are competitive internationally.
Stepping in an institutional peculiarity of Greece.
Be careful now.
How many will admit that this formation of tutorials that some demonstratively call paramedics created a know-how that is competitive internationally, that the official school will never create.
These are the dominant narratives, the dominant models that I said about before that sometimes prevent us.
And to say another example? There is a Greek model, business, the Internet Cafes, that students go in the afternoons and play with their company online adventure games.
This model is original internationally.
It does not exist in Europe.
And it is very beneficial for the students because it develops a spirit of cooperation since they play together, and of course other complex abilities, things that of course the Greek school does not give them.
But the state treats the Internet Cafes with huge suspicion that there is a gambling behind it.
And he's trying in various ways to shut them down.
And entrepreneurs cannot defend their jobs by citing European standards because they are not comparable.
That is, their peculiarity that could be an advantage becomes a disadvantage because of the suspicion of the state.
In 1976, in my first job, I worked on a research project for the Ministry of Education and the World Bank.
And there were a number of foreign consultants coming to help us at work.
At one point, a professor of economic history appeared from a very large, well-known American university.
We were then in a building on Ermou Street.
In a work break he asked me about my thesis - I did a thesis at the time - which had the theme of monopoly concentration in the Greek industry.
I was very influenced at that time by the neo-Marxist theories of development.
The neo-Marxist theories of development which talked about the dependence and development of the European periphery.
So when he asked me I started telling him about the metropolises of capitalism that concentrate all the technology there, and about how underdeveloped my country is.
He listened to me very patiently and at the end he said to me: "Well all this, but have you noticed the coffee maker's record?" and he meant... that's it.
He meant that.
So he explained to me how amazingly designed he is, to touch loosely on the fingers and with the weight of the glass stabilized and when the cafeteria goes up and down the bedroom the stairs of the ministry not to pour the water.
He says, “So well designed a record, I, in America, haven’t seen.”
And I confess he left me speechless.
I was talking to him about the big narratives and he was talking to me about the coffee maker's record.
I learned something that day.
That you don't learn the real economy by reading, you learn by watching.
And that technology is not only what is in Intel's labs, but the choices that every professional makes every day.
Obviously I'm not saying it to say it to say that the albums will save our economy.
I say it because I think he is right, Nikos Anagnostou, the blogger who writes about technology, when he wrote in a recent post very nicely: "Extroversion does not need to be impressive."
Competitiveness does not need to be impressive.
Well, our new extroverted micro-entertainment will not fit into some big narrative, they will not have the official blessing of the state that has a pharmacy today.
They will not be considered a function, nor will they have the certainty of the public, nor the glamour of career in a big company, nor will they have copied successful models from Business Week.
They will be improvised, they will look like rough and Balkan and mysterious.
Owners alone should invent the narrative that will give meaning and durability to what they do.
The rest of us should not underestimate them because they are the ones who will bail us out.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
- Hello.
When I was asked to speak at this year's TEDxAcademy, the first obvious question, of course, was what the issue is and I confess that the answer troubled me.
"Development," they told me.
What do I have to do with evolution? I can talk to you about a lot of unpleasant developments in my country, but that's not the point.
I thought about it a little bit, I didn't mean, not.
It was an honorary invitation, and suddenly I came up with what the younger "flashes" say.
An inspiration.
And I said that here Europe, 60 and more years, is doing the most impressive, revolutionary, political experiment.
Well, let me talk to you about this.
Let me tell you the good news, let me tell you the bad news and close in a few words about Greece.
Well, my theme today is the Europe experiment.
What were the goals of this experiment that began in the 1950s? First of all, the consolidation of peace in a Europe with open borders.
Remember on a small continent, fragmented, with many states that carry on their backs a long, glorious history, but full of wars and bloody conflicts.
The second objective is to achieve economic prosperity through the creation of a large, free, competitive European market, but at the same time by creating those tools that would help Europe's less developed countries and regions to converge.
Third objective: to strengthen democratic institutions, particularly in countries with a problematic political past.
And fourth goal: the application of the ancient saying: "strength in union", that is, in a world that changes very quickly, in a world where size counts, the countries of Europe, even the once large and mighty ones, no longer have either the special weight or the size to be protagonists on the world stage, nor even usually secondary.
These were the main goals.
What are the means we use to achieve these goals? First, the establishment of a culture of cooperation and dialogue.
In Europe, we are to negotiate and negotiate to the death.
Endlessly.
But, to tell you the truth, I prefer seventeen-hour negotiations, albeat midnight, than shooting each other, as we had the habit of doing for centuries in Europe.
And second means: the creation of common institutions and policies on which this culture of cooperation will be based.
You will tell me all this is good to hear in words, but in practice what can be done? My answer is simple: that too much has been done.
Europe became unrecognizable within 50 years.
And you want me to tell you differently? What is the proof of the success of the European political experiment, at least until the last few years? Think of Europe as a small shop, which starts in the 50's, is small, poor, sells only two products, essentially coal and steel.
These were the two products with which the European Coal and Steel Community started.
And with six members.
Today, this small shop has become a huge supermarket, selling everything, although always different quality products, and has increased its clientele.
From six members we became 28 and many more are joined to enter.
I don't think there's a more great proof of success of a shop than constantly increasing your turnover and your clientele.
And to add something else, and to be considered, until relatively recent, a model for the rest of the world.
Good news, but let's come to the bad news.
And there's bad news.
Europe is in crisis.
The crisis is deep.
You will tell me crises Europe has had many in the past.
My answer, however, would be that this crisis is fundamental, there is a risk of an existential crisis for the European political experiment.
So why judgment? Let me give some explanations.
Obviously, the list is not exhaustive.
A first reason Europe is in crisis is because sometimes, we probably proceeded too fast, without enough preparation, without thinking about the consequences of our actions.
I will give you a very simple and typical example.
It is the example of the euro.
We decided in Europe, in the early 90's, to make a common currency.
This is the abduction of the European political experiment.
It is the most advanced stage of political development.
But, we have created this common currency, but we have not created either the institutional or the political background on which it will rely, nor the economic tools that will make the euro viable.
In other words, we tried to repeat in politics and economics, the miracle of immaculate conception.
That is, currency without a state.
There is no currency without a state and we learn this "the hard way", as the Turks say.
This is the first explanation.
The second is that we were unprepared, but we were also unlucky.
Because he did not have time for the euro to complete his ten years of life and came the breaking of the largest international financial bubble since 1929.
No one could have predicted it, that's misfortune.
So it's also a lack of preparation and, obviously, misfortune.
But there are other reasons.
The third category refers to reasons that have to do with the interior of our countries.
What has been going on for 20-30 years? In European countries, but also in all developed countries of the Western world? Economic inequalities are constantly widening.
This is much more pronounced in the US and Britain than in most continental European countries.
At the same time, the number of our fellow citizens who feel they are losing, that they can no longer cope with the competition that is being created, losing to globalisation and European integration, is constantly increasing.
These people are against globalization and against Europe.
If no way is found to address this problem, the problem will swell further in the coming years.
And fourth reason is: it's not the best neighborhood.
Let me remind you, if you look at the map of Europe, we only have a neighborhood in the east and south.
In the north there are only polar bears and in the west we have fish.
So we are dealing with neighbors in the East and the South.
These neighbors are not going well.
Most of Europe’s neighbors belong to the category of losers of globalization.
And to all this economic problem came to be added in recent years war and religious conflicts.
One of the results of all these problems in our neighborhood is the huge increase in migratory flows.
The migrant crisis risks a crisis in Europe in which the euro crisis will pale, and a crisis that can blow up Europe.
Europe certainly needs to show solidarity with people who are being perpetuated.
He needs to discuss a fairer burden-sharing.
But it also needs a third condition.
And this is the effective control of the external borders of Europe, in general, and of Greece, since it is in the whole of Europe.
So, with this crisis in recent years, we have come to a situation in which our coexists within the EU has become difficult.
Discontent is indulging, the acceptance of the European political experiment is constantly decreasing.
And that is why this sometimes resembles a cohabitation, I called this in a book I wrote last year and published in various languages, “the unfortunate union”, that is, Europe is in danger of becoming a cohabitation into a polygamous relationship in which the partners stay inside, not so much because they love each other, but because they are afraid of the cost of divorce, or because they are afraid to be left alone.
You'll tell me, fear keeps a lot of marriage.
But I don't think it's enough for a successful European symbiosis.
And now a few words about Greece.
As you know, Greece has been integral, hopefully, part of this European political experiment for many decades.
Greece’s relationship with Europe has been difficult, sometimes, very episodic.
I would say that the people in Greece, our fellow citizens, at least those who consider our participation in the political experiment the European, a positive development, can be divided into three major categories.
In the first category belong our fellow citizens who believe that Europe is like a cow that you milk as much as you can.
These people usually have a very relaxed treatment of how common rules are applied.
Any rules, whether Greek or European.
A second category considers Europe as the safe anchorage for a ship, the Greek one, which often seems ungovernable, because the crew members constantly fight with each other, because they do not let the captain catch the wheel, because everyone has a different view of where they should go.
And this often ungovernable ship is also forced to travel in very difficult seas.
Because the neighborhood of Greece is difficult.
So, in this category, Greece offers a safe anchor.
There's a third category, to which fewer belong, I think.
Although, I believe, the most suspects.
They are the ones who considered from the beginning our participation in the European political experiment as an additional, not the only one, as an additional means of achieving a goal that goes back a long way, to the Greek Revolution, if you will, or even before: the creation of a modern, European state in Greece, a rule of law with strong democratic institutions, with economic prosperity and social solidarity.
Obviously, these three categories have always been the vast majority of Greeks and Greek women.
There were, of course, the others always.
The others, who, either for whom Europe is saying nothing, have never meant anything, perhaps because Europe represents what they themselves call “bourgeois values” and “bourgeois democracy,” which does not satisfy them.
Either because some others fantasize about a Greece in another part of the world that is not exactly clear where that will be.
And of course in recent years, with the great crisis, the extreme nationalists came out of the caves.
So this crisis in Europe is changing the internal balance within the country.
Greece, unfortunately, has ended up in recent years as the most problematic member, certainly of the Eurozone, probably of the entire European Union.
And of course the big question is, "Who is to blame for all this?" I don't have the time, about three minutes I still have in front of me, to answer you on this question.
I'll answer it in indirectly.
I believe that the management of the Greek crisis of recent years will take place, is already being done, but much more in the future, a course that will be taught in more and more universities, not only in Greece, but internationally.
Because it is precisely the example of a crisis that says what not to do in a similar crisis.
And the responsibilities concern not only, to be fair, to the political leadership of the country and our society in general, but also to our European partners and the International Monetary Fund.
In other words, it is an awareness of a great, huge responsibility for a failed management of the crisis, whose cost is too high.
And I come to the end.
What do we do from now on? Certainly, Europe needs to change if it wants to overcome the crisis.
I know that TEDx is expected to speaker or speaker who will come here to bring a positive message.
We need optimism.
If I only brought you a positive message, I think I would make fun of you.
What is at stake in Europe today is huge.
There is, for sure, the possibility of Europe overcoming this crisis with more unity and changed.
But the risk of Europe getting bogged down or even having ruptures or partial dissolution is really visible.
And the first thing I wanted to tell you all of you is that you think that the success of the European political experiment is a matter for all of us, it is something that directly concerns all of us and our children.
If Europe's political experiment fails, one of the biggest victims of failure will be this country.
So, do what you can, as active citizens of the European Union, to contribute, as far as possible, each and every one to achieve this European experiment.
And, finally, something else.
Certainly, Europe needs to change.
But I believe that before Europe changes, we have to change Greece.
We must, at last, be honest, look in the mirror, take our responsibilities, see what is wrong in this country, try to liberate the country from its shackles.
Only when we start changing Greece will we have acquired a reliable and serious reason for how Europe will change.
- Thank you.
(Applause)
Let's talk about ideas.
Ideas are alive.
They come to us through questions, images, coincidences, and even dreams.
They are attractive.
[Idea] They excite us, lead us to wonderful roads, which are full of challenges and full of unexpected developments.
They give us strength, but they also have their own dynamics.
A dynamic that helps them evolve and affect more and more people, who feed them back and thus maintains undiminished enthusiasm and inspiration that exude.
Even though I prepared a speech and I pronounced him, I wish, well enough to tell you today, I'm sure the ideas and connotations that are coming I'll probably deviate from what I wanted to say, but let's start and see.
The German philosopher Edmund Husserl had described that every man is the center of the world.
This is because it perceives the world with it as a starting point and as a measure of comparison.
What describes the "number punkck" point, as he called it, is that every man has a completely personal image of the world, which passes through his emotional or logical filter.
We could as Greeks say: between Apollonius and his Dionysian self.
This balance between our two sides has gradually begun to recede.
This is because logic is beginning to dominate.
Although we perceive the world mainly by the experience - that is, we describe a distance, not in meters, but in how many minutes we take us to walk it - yet we try to rationalise it all.
We could say: square them.
The ideas that brought me here today concern architecture, but especially an architecture, which tries to satisfy the conditions of modern and future man, but through the bridging of emotion and reason, by the experiential with the metric.
Modern man is active.
We understand this from the intense rhythms of life and many times from the frequent change of our way of life.
The established architectural immobility does not seem to satisfy this condition.
And that's why the first idea, which I'm going to talk about, is flexibility.
Flexibility is not something new – and I personally have often applied it within an architectural context, either as research or practice.
But I understood its true dimension from another occupation.
As a set designer and assistant director in the amateur theatre to which I belonged.
There, mainly due to [uncomprehensible], but also because of the challenge to create the appropriate environment with the greatest impact at the lowest cost, I often made the sets with multi-functional objects.
That is, objects, which depending on how they were placed in space and what orientation they had created a completely different feel.
The feeling that was necessary to convey this feeling that the theatrical performance wanted.
This dimension, namely how we understand the environment differently, I thought that as a key element of volatility, was something I searched and I think I understood enough to gradually lead me to create a theory that optimized the use of space in time.
That is, we could use the space as best as possible in time so that we would not have a waste of it.
This was called spatial economy or spatial economy.
But dealing with theatre, the truth is thus led me to something else, which concerned me: the place of man in architecture.
The position of man, in theory, is at the heart of the design.
Nevertheless, what I realized is that it is more involved as dimensions.
And not as an experience.
In directing and in scenography, the basis is an action, an activity, and man is always focusing on it.
The space complements it.
It complements him as an expression, complements him as a more general feeling.
And here I was born with another idea.
That architecture, probably should be more concerned with this feeling, with this experience, to come out of activity, and not in any other way.
So, he was born - or rather, because this was something that was already working - was the activity-based design, that is, the design based on the activity.
This is a design direction that has a qualitative difference from ordinary design.
That: does not understand activity as a piecemeal use, which leads to ergonomics, but as a whole.
As something, which has a temporal footprint and varies experientially depending on time.
This thing, this dimension, this perspective, means that we are enriching the architectural question beyond ergonomics.
With other features, so that the architectural answer is better.
Here I want to emphasize this: The role of architecture is to give answers.
The answers are dependent on how well the questions were asked.
A well-written question means a better answer.
And in our case: a better architectural solution.
Thus, the creation of a methodology, which was enriched with more issues, for which the space should be addressed, led to the formation of the spatial needs around an activity, to be better defined, so that the architecture would come to dress them.
Thus, the logic of the dynamic building program was created, which in turn led to the creation of an online platform, where people, through an application they probably use, like the Google Calendar, can pass through the activities they have and thus better understand their spatial needs or what kind of spaces they need to make them better.
And in this way, in principle, to evaluate the existing spaces they have, but also to better identify future ones based on their future needs.
This application, of course, could not have been done unless we have pervasive information.
I belong to the generation where I lived the whole transition to today's digital culture, let's call it it.
I was 13 years old when the first personal computers came out and I was, perhaps one of the first, to deal with it.
In fact, an activity that was hidden, as it was not very popular at the time because we had the girls.
And I lived through the whole passage how little everyone started to deal with it.
In fact, to such an extent that with some friends of mine we have been talking about that we should probably stop dealing with it because this acceptance is massively strange.
The point is that these two, namely, that is, this digital age brought to everyone two, say, basic concepts in our lives.
That of automation and that of interconnection.
[automation + interface] Automation is something that is done for us without our assistance.
That is, it is something that is considered beneficial, it is planned in this way to happen without us spending time and energy. Interconnection, on the other hand, is the ability, in a variety of ways, to communicate connection with remote people and places.
These two are so intense today, so widespread, so much data, that their absence really is unpleasant to us.
This means that these two technologies are perfectly sensible to be integrated into space.
That is: it is a logical next step and this leads to robotic architecture.
The robotic architecture – the research I have done and my occupation with it – showed me clearly and confident that it is applicable.
That is, the technical problems I considered, in its application, seemed to be all solved and really solved.
I was excited about that.
In essence, it is the peak of variability in architecture.
It really is the combination of many ideas with different starting points that came and completed a puzzle, a puzzle, which I thought had been completed, that is, either in terms of theory, methodology or application, all the pieces had been set up so that robotic architecture was applicable.
So I thought a bigger idea had been molded and had been completed.
I was so excited about what I wrote and a book on it.
The point is, however, as I told you before, the ideas are alive.
And that came to prove it to me something simple, a door.
You're going to tell me what a door did?
You'll tell me what you've been waiting for through a door?
That's what I thought.
The thing is, this door when it opened while working and I was absorbed, I was annoyed, I was quite annoyed.
In fact, to the extent that this started to trouble me because it happened and suddenly I think I thought that one of the most important ideas I had in this field came to me.
That is, that although something is considered useful, expected, even if we have asked for it to happen, if it happens at the wrong time, it is unpleasant.
It doesn't matter what that is.
[the strange] And this, suddenly, rang that bell on me in something, which in a sense underpink, but I didn't see it.
That is, while robotic architecture seems to have so many benefits, why is it not more widespread? And I understood why it can be annoying.
What makes communication between people unannoying and enjoyable is the property of empathy and understanding.
That is, the property of understanding, to read a situation and to adjust our behavior to be compatible with this situation.
If one does not have this ability, behaves exactly the same or similar in all possible situations, then an embarrassment is created that in turn leads to the submersion of communicativeness.
Unfortunately robotic systems have a predicted and usually similar behavior.
And this can be great if we are to have a use with repeated duty, such as fitting something or screwing a screw 24/7, but when you're dealing with people, that's problematic, because people often change mood and behaviour.
And in order to be pleasant, you have to follow it.
The integration of empathy and understanding in the cognitive characteristics of a robotic system, gave birth to the -let's say- design methodology or incorporation of technology into architecture, Sensponsive, derived from the word sensability, which means empathy with understanding, and responsive meaning.
Such a system, therefore, will never react to a situation if it does not first understand the mood of people in space.
Of course, a system that really fully understands all situations is far from our potential.
But what we can do and we are working on, is depending on the activity we want to benefit through our architecture, we study the dominant factors.
Those factors that benefit it more directly.
Another feature of this application, that is, beyond the ability to understand man, is discretion, that is, what we said before that behavior must be such that it is appropriate in conditions.
This means, then, that the system tries to have the right behavior so that it is the least annoying one.
Minimize this dimension and be as beneficial as possible.
Now are you going to tell me where we're applying it? And how? Right now we have two basic directions, in which we work on this theory.
One is about enhancing learning.
The aim is to create an original lecture space, where the listener can keep his attention for longer and be able to learn more from the lecture.
We achieve this as we watch two critical parameters: one is of attention and the other is alert.
When the grade of these two has dropped long enough to understand that listeners probably take the least of this lecture, then a system of discreet interventions in space is activated, which we have experimentally confirmed in the laboratory, that when they happen, they activate the public and rejuvenate attention.
So with this Sensponsive intervention we manage the listeners of a lecture to get what more it has to give and all that remains is the lecture itself to give.
The other direction is about something mixed.
It has to do with the concept of habitation and in the sense of psychological balance.
The aim of this research was how we can undo the negative effects of mild stress and depression, oftentimes caused by the intense pace of life and work of the modern world.
For various reasons, this research eventually focused more on extreme environments, so we found ourselves studying and building functional prototypes of a living chamber for astronauts on the international space station.
[unfaithful] The goal of this system was to understand the mood of people inside, so as to change the layout and environmental conditions, so as to help them calm down, better, find themselves in a psychological balance, rest more and withstand the continuity of their mission.
In fact, this research opened another door for us.
We were invited to NASA, Houston and especially in the Human Research Program, as this is one of the few approaches that a solution really suggests to improve the living conditions of people on long-term missions in space.
Something that is designed for the near future.
I think all these ideas, and especially the contexts of application, really describe a window into the future.
They describe the application of an interactive architecture that aims to create truly beneficial environments, which are free from negative influences.
In general, I believe this should be the vision of technology.
Optimism for a tomorrow, which we think is better.
Personally, in order to keep this perspective clean, I write science fiction novels.
so that I can mentally experience the worlds I would like to make.
But the key ingredient for all of this is ideas.
Ideas are alive and should be diffused.
Let your ideas spread, grow, evolve, for only through them can we live the world of tomorrow, today.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Good evening!
(Applause) I today would like to talk to you about the value of truth in our daily lives.
Let’s start with us here today, which of you remember you have told a truth, we don’t have to say which, to a friend, to a partner, to yourself, in the last month, to raise a hand.
Who has told a truth? Well done we tell truths!
I'm glad, because I didn't know what the public's reaction would be to this question.
Many have claimed that truth is a mirror of our reality to which we do not always have access to, because our senses are impermeable.
Others claim that truth is a personal matter, it is subjective to each of us and changes with the becoming of our lives.
I today want to refer to the truth as Heraclitus has defined it, who told us that the truth is the opposite of oblivion, that is, it is something that needs to be revealed and come to light.
This truth is associated with many aspects of our daily lives, indeed, it is connected to reality, reveals aspects of it, intensifies the understanding and perception of our world, promotes the self-awareness and authenticity of our personal expression, while it very often leads to honesty and decision-making.
On my own personal path the truth has always been associated with architecture and the city.
Now you will tell me, what does the city have to do with the truth? The theoretical architect Louis Mumford has told us that the city's final mission is to intensify man's conscious participation in the universal and historical process.
This multiplication of all dimensions of life, through emotional union, logical communication, technological mastery and above all dramaturgical representation, has been the most important duty of the city in history.
This saying made me think that our cities function roughly as accelerators, that is, they accelerate processes, relationships, events, in which we exist, with our values and with our way of life, that is, cities create chain reactions that increase our consciousness.
The interesting here is the way.
Mamford tells us that this is happening through emotional union, logical communication, technological mastery and dramaturgical representation.
I will focus more on technological mastery and dramaturgical representation as I have come across through my work.
But before we talk about technological mastery, I want to go one step back and look a little at the tools we use.
According to the theoretical architects Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wiggley in their book Are We Human?, they argue that the tools we make ultimately make us.
They claim, starting with Darwin's theory, that the human hand is what adapted to his tools, not the other way around.
That is, essentially our relationship with technology is two-way, and they continue to say that human creations are interface surfaces, which as we shape them shape us.
Take for example our mobile phone, which you all know, you may have noticed that changes in the design of the device over the years have changed and the way we behave, our habits, even our gaze and our walk have changed, so a technology device can change us.
How could we reverse this process? How could we influence this relationship? If we were probably designing our mobile phone and its applications? What if we designed all our technological tools? This question mark, along with many others, came to answer the Maker Movement.
The Maker Movement is a movement that aims to democratize technology through the creation of free software and hardware.
About 15 years ago in venues such as hacker spaces, Maker spaces and other online communities, groups of inventors, researchers, developers, began sharing technology platforms with the general public and creating new technological tools accessible to everyone.
For example, microprocessors were created, such as Arduino, Arduino lilypad, Raspberry Pie among others, and corresponding programming languages with which we can easily program our own applications and create our own tools.
Essentially what did the Maker Movement achieve with this? It managed to bring new tools to light, to take them out of the black box of technology that was to date for most of us.
Something else that Maker Movement has achieved is to change our relationship with technology, it made it a game, and through easy experimentation too many of us came close to technology to play, experiment and many times to create innovative applications out of nowhere.
One last and very important thing that the Maker Movement achieved is that it brought us together.
That is, through the sharing of knowledge, through the offline and online communities it brought us together to create, and taught us to function collectively, in groups.
But what is the value of open technologies in the public space, and especially in the arts that concerns me? The political scientist Santal Mouf has told us that art in the public space needs to question the given order, the Status quo.
When technology is used in art, it needs to not repeat mainstream applications, the mainstream way we use it, but used in a different way, to create new correlations.
Because we need this plurality in the public space, because it promotes the dialogue between us.
So open technologies lead us precisely in this direction, because through accessibility and experimentation they allow a large group of users, experts and amateurs, to engage, to propose new meanings and new representations in the public space.
Speaking of representations, I return to the quote of Mamford, who told us that the dramaturgical representation is important and for the first time I met this concept when I was studying architecture here, at the School of Architecture of Patras several years ago and I was wondering which direction to follow.
Among the visual arts, the urban design, the architectural landscape, I was also a little indecisive, at some point I did a task that brought to the surface my love for the cultural landscape, that is, I wanted to explore the relationship of the human body and gaze with its immediate natural and artificial environments through small-scale architecture.
Also then I had a curiosity about technology and how technology can participate in these experiences, so I went to London to do a corresponding master's degree.
In one of my first works I began to explore these representations and the relationship between natural and artificial.
For example, I created the Wind chime, which is a metal melodian representation.
I don't know if you know it, it's this musical instrument we put on the porch and it makes a metal melody when the wind blows.
In my case, in my version, I exchanged the metal tubes with the plastics the wii remote controls that I programed to produce metallic sounds, to mimic them and slowly turn them into noise.
Another representation, I explored through Fabrique, this work, in which I wanted to explore our relationship with a nature that is not natural, a mechanical nature, and to fundamentally question the concept of nature as we know it, to see what is behind it.
This particular work, when one watered these pots with light, the chains on the roof begin to move, and in the end they tune into a small choreography.
At some point, within my artistic quest, I decided to follow another path, that of the game.
In 2011, with two partners, we created Athens Plaython.
Athens Plaython is a festival of horror games and new technologies.
Back then in Athens we had very frequent phenomena of violence through the streets of Athens, and were accompanied by arson and disasters and we wanted to give another voice, an optimistic voice, through play and collectivity.
And we saw our city change, we saw too many, maybe thousands of people in the last year especially, come to play with us for a weekend and we saw the city's space change.
How did this happen? Through the game -- why? Because the game has this quality, to introduce us in a magical way to an inner world of fiction, that is, for example, it can turn urban space into a battlefield, where various groups may negotiate a neighborhood, or start appearing mermaids, dragons, knights and so on.
But this world of fiction is not independent of the urban space, on the contrary it contains it.
That is, the urban space is increased through the game, it acquires new properties, which are created collectively.
So at that moment I realized that for me this medium of representation is important, the game, because it brings us all inside, and it creates collectives.
Later I created my workshop Entropika together with a team of collaborators, and we continue to create interactive installations in the public space, for example one of our projects, Cloudscapes, creates precisely the representation of a natural phenomenon, cloud and rain.
It essentially simulates the sound of lightning and rain, and light of light when passers-by pass by.
It was another opportunity to explore how these representations affect urban space.
In fact, in this work he showed me a truth after many years, that while the first works were more theoretical, with ideas that I had worked out very much, and I particularly liked a task, a work like this, simpler, with a simpler idea but with a playful mood, it had much more immediacy with the world, we had children who were trying to enchant it by shouting abra, we had passers-by who would put their hood.The thunder was constantly shouting Thor.
(Laughter) On the same street, we continued with the Playstools, where again we explored a little bit of the playful dimensions of the objects we were making, and we created a hybrid variation of the game musical chairs.
In this game, these stools also have extra properties, we would not only leave physical objects, each stool has two touch sensors, they have light, they produce sound and communicate with each other through a wireless network, essentially because they facilitate and can enter any space like this.
They invite players to interact with stoves in each round of the game and the team that wins the most wins in color wins.
In fact, the future of this game we want to become an open educational platform where children, perhaps wiser designers than us, can raise their own games and change the rules of the game at will.
At this point I also put an upper dot last January, because I decided to go to Matera, Italy, where I work at the Open Design School.
Open Design School is a pilot project of the cultural capital Matera 2019.
There we are called to design structures for the public space, which serve all cultural events for this year and next year.
These structures can be stands, stand for information, theatrical sets and so on.
The interesting thing is that we again use open design tools, i.e. through the philosophy of Open structures if you know, if you don't know what it is, it's an online platform, a website and a community where everyone can share their plans, freely without copyright, with the rest of the community, and anyone can evolve them and redistribute them online.
The second interesting thing is that here too we are called to plan through play and experimentation, this follows me.
That is, we are not called upon to design the well-known structures, such as bleachers that look like bleachers, this can be done by anyone.
We are called to investigate through experimentation and design mysterious, playful objects that raise questions to residents and the city, do not give the answers directly.
So all my course I've seen that I'm very often returning to Mamford's original question, about what the technology we need, what is the technological mastery, and what are the representations we need in the city? And the personal answer I've given is that the technological mastery we need need should be open and accessible to everyone.
As for the representations, I have seen that many of them need to be participatory, collective and invite us to play with them.
Of course this is my answer, it's my truth, and it doesn't take for each of us to deal with art and technology to see the value of truth within the city.
Mamford, if you remember, said that the truth in the city is emerging from emotional union and logical communication.
So our cities are us, and regardless of everyone's status, each of us can contribute truthfully to our collective lives.
So today I would like to invite you to share a truth with the colleague, with the partner, with a friend, but first of all, I would like to invite you to share a truth with yourself.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Because I'm old-fashioned, I take the microphone and not what they put in the ear.
Needless to say, because I see too many young people and I know that they have passed nationwide, I feel tonight, and I have the same crash, as if I have to spend panhellenic.
However, I prefer as old as I am than to be 18 and have to spend panhellenic in Greece.
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you a story, a fairy tale that has a lot of starting points.
Many have a starting point in their lives.
I don't know why I got too many and every time I started from a new road.
From what I remember I remember myself in Samos, while I was not born in Samos, but I went three years old with my sister who was a year and a half older than me, because our mother had tuberculosis and sent us to my grandfather and her big sister.
For me the whole world was Samos, this was Greece.
The pine trees, the sea, the grandfather -- who we thought was an ancient Greek because he was a professor of ancient Greek, he was in retirement -- only for ancient people he was talking to us, telling us myths and we felt that this is a happy place that we didn't want to lose at all.
And what we mostly saw is that in life as you put your shoes in the morning so you have to get a book.
Because we always watched our grandfather hold a book in hand.
When our grandfather left, I thought he took everything with him and it was a new starting point.
Soon we went to Athens, went to school and to school I felt the first thing that is friendship; I became friends with Georges Sari and until her last moment, when she left forever, we stayed friends.
And this, guys, to your young people, I say, that friendship plays a very big role in life.
At school I started reading and in fact, with my sister we loved to read poetry and especially poems sadly: Palamas's "Aphicist and unaccommodated of the Tomb I don't give you".
Of Polemis ... And we were crying, we read them at night and we were crying.
And so something went to me, lest I write a poem.
My mother had a twin brother, a beautiful – both on the outside and internally – man.
He was a math teacher and a girl who badly found us wrong because we thought - he was also a godfather - that he belonged to us.
This girl was called and Geod on top, she had a little crooked nose, but she had some eyes that were making flames.
This Dido became our great writer Dido Sotiriou.
And many may have known her as a writer, but anyone who has not known her as a human has lost much.
At her wedding I wrote her a poem.
She smiled, but when I looked at her eyes they seemed so sad and I made a decision in my life that I would not be a poet.
(Laughter) Well, I'll tell you guys the poem because it's been 82 years and in Brussels where I live in my daughter, my daughter came to mind one night.
I'll tell you so you can tell you what poetry got out of, what you and I were spared.
“At dawn with the dew, my godmother, my beloved, where I went with the boat a little to swim I saw a white seagull that was flying joyfully run, tell me to go to your godmother Joy, tra la la, la la la” (Laughter) (Anchorage) Did you think I lost?
And I'm so glad I didn't.
I forgot to tell you that in Grandpa's house in Samos, in the living room, there was a window and inside there was a tiger, the "kaplani".
So they said it in Samos and I thought that everyone in Greece knows it when I was writing the book "The Kaplani (of the Showcase)".
Neither did Kaplani know then, nor do I, what role we would both play in our lives.
With Didod we learned a lot of things, she made us want to love something, to care about something, to read of course.
The war came and Dido put us in the resistance.
And our first resistance act we did - and Dido told us, "Don't think it's nothing, it's a great thing."
As my father was away at the bank that worked in the morning and returned at noon our house became a jaffa.
Dido brought the women of the resistance: the Electra executed by the Germans, Melpo Axiotis, Zevgou, Svolou.
They were meeting and when they left - because they smoked like tekkes - our resistance act with my sister was to open the balcony door, to ventilate the smell of smoke not to return our father home and see that it was such a situation.
We organized ourselves in EPON and so that we remember now, and many times with my Live, as long as she lived, we sat and said, "let's not tell anyone that the years of the occupation were happy years."
Because we believed in something, because we had a vision, because we believed that we really help to liberate Greece.
And we had a vision that we were saying, when the occupation is over we will live that vision of ours.
Now if he didn't come out, it's another... I went to the school of Aidonopoulou and had a teacher in the techniques who wanted to get us out of this sadness and blackness and hunger and to take our minds to think other things and says “Chiles...” - she had studied in France at the school of fine arts - "...we will have puppetry".
He says to me, "What do you know you do?" I say, "Nothing."
He asked me what my name was, "Ah," he says, "Are you Alki Zei?" And I say, "Yes."
Because in the school's magazine a small piece of mine had been published.
Dimitris Kalavros-Gousiou: A thousand apologies.
Alki Zei: Will you keep it from me?
(Laughter) (Applause) He tells me, "Then write works for the puppet theater."
And I sat down very simply and wrote works about the puppet theater, which we played, and one day he tells us, "Now look be very good because some friends will come"; because it was the children of the school who saw them.
She had a very friend Empirikos and brought us, more or less, Empirikos, Elytis, Marios Ploritis.
Who Marios Ploritis brought a friend who was, along with Koun, from the founders of the Kuh Theater, who was named Giorgos Sevastikoglou and became my later companion.
And my sister had long said to me, "Who are you going to date with, again with him with the ugly surname?"
(Laughter) Empirikos was thrilled with the puppet theater.
And we didn't think we did anything great.
We simply loved this thing we did.
And when the ones we had them, the great people, the poets, who were very simple and treated us very amicably - invited us to drink coffee at Loumidis, and since then we often went and heard.
And there were other girls, I don't know why girls and not boys, they weren't going.
And we listened to them, so, with great joy and learned things.
That is, more of them than from university.
At EPON we had a party all night because we could not go home late, traffic was forbidden.
And we put on a gram, we did what we danced to be able to print illegal newspapers, press, proclamations and more.
Of course, in the meantime, we were dancing, we were already flirting.
On the piano he played all night a child with a long scarf and we put black raisins in his mouth so he wouldn't get hungry all night.
And this kid was Manos Hatzidakis.
(Applause) October 12 is a day when it is neither celebrated in Greece nor learn of school, it was the day of liberation.
As far as I can remember, it was the happiest day of my life.
Where we were liberated, that we believed that all our dreams would be made.
But, it didn't last many days and the December '44 began that I wish hadn't existed either in history or in my life.
That's where I knew what civil war is.
What does it mean to split in two.
What will the friend next to me say at the desk I had, when we arrived on foot and went to Volos, and knocked on her door, she saw me as if she saw her great enemy.
And that's where I said, it's not possible anymore not to love each other, the man we were close to.
And all that wildness that December had, I haven't forgotten.
And now when I see the refugees walking miles to get there, I remember how we walked to escape when December ended when no slipping bags were over then, we used to put on newspapers and sleep, they were taking a mess of us on top.
Then I realized what war was going to mean.
Who wasn't scared in my life as much as I was scared in December '44.
There goes that, it's over.
Some liberation came, things started to be done smoothly in Greece.
In the meantime, I married George Sevastikoglou, I went to the Drama School.
I forgot to say that I was writing short stories and published them in a magazine called "Youth Voice".
I was starting to write.
And because George Sevastikoglou was very with Koun, I was going to the Kuhn theatre, and this is the very important thing, in black possession Koun taught the world Ibsen, the American theatre, the real theater.
With the hunger that existed, both his actors and he were hungry, but they did what is an unforgettable theatre and the roots of today have remained.
So I stung a little bit and I say maybe I go out to the theater.
George said to me, "I think you'd write, write."
I didn't go to the school where he taught at Rota's school, because he was sure he wouldn't take me.
I went to the school of the Athens Conservatory, which Rodiris and Veakis taught, and they said that Rontiris made a stake speak.
Looks like he did the stake a little bit and he spoke and I finished school.
Meanwhile, a civil war is slowly starting.
They're starting to arrest people.
George is called to the army and secretly leaves Greece.
With a boat and I didn't know where he went.
And they sent me for a walk in Chios.
There I met the women of Greece, who outside Athens I had not come out.
I met women from Mytilene, from Northern Greece, from islands, from everywhere.
Women who many came not for ideology, had no idea, but had mainly caught Mytilene very many, a child of their guerrilla and brought them there and when they were told that they are free, they cried because they understood that their son had been killed.
I learned there a year and then I came back.
I almost didn’t know where George was.
Until through the Milliex, who was then in Paris, I got a letter to try to leave Greece to go find him.
At first where I didn't know.
They had taken them after the end of the civil war in Tashkent and because I am ageographed, my children tell me that if I knew where Tashkent is, they would not have been born.
(Laughter) I managed, anyway, with the many and with big means and got a passport and left.
And I went to Italy, waiting for the Soviet visa, which took two years to come, and I arrived in Moscow.
And when I got off the train and I saw that George wasn't waiting for me, I got.
I say, "Where am I going, where are they sending me?"
Anyway, they received there, I didn't know Russian or anything, a little French, a little Italian I could understand.
They put me on a train and it was some strange women in uniforms, in costumes, curious people with beards.
And I traveled five nights and four days.
And I was passing the Steppe, and every now and then I asked, "Tashkent?" I say that the train passes by and I go elsewhere.
Anyway, I arrived.
This time George was waiting for me.
And I learned something that immediately shocked me: that they had not allowed him to come.
Not the Soviets, ours, the Greek party.
They had not allowed him to come and receive me in Moscow.
New starting point, this time a little difficult because I had to get used to where I am, who I am, what I do.
I haven't written there, I'm not writing anything, I'm trying to learn the language.
My daughter is born and, fortunately, we go to Moscow.
Because we were completely isolated from Greece, while in Moscow we could and started breaking the ice and through the Greek-Soviet link began to come intellectuals, artists.
And one of the first who came was Empirikos, whom I haven't seen for 20 years.
And I went to the train to welcome him and the performance that Embiricos had seen - because I was writing parodies, the weepings I used to call them, stories of Odysseus alternating - and this work he saw was "Calypso", who was in love with Odysseus and was an intellectual surrealist.
Because then we had just learned about Surrealism.
And when Odysseus leaves, she commits suicide and says, "I am a sad corn."
(Laughter) Arriving the train the first to come down was Empirikos and, as soon as he sees me, with 20 years, he says, "Behold the sad corn."
(Laughter) And it's what's left.
Why... (Applause) I didn't think I was doing anything great and I didn't put carbon at least, to have a copy.
I left, they put them in a basement, the rats ate them and there's nothing left.
In Moscow, fortunately, I started writing.
I was writing short stories, Stylish in the art show.
And then I wanted to, because I had also given birth to my son in the meantime - which Tarkovsky bore a baby-sisiting for him, because he was a student and he wanted to take out a pocket money and through a friend who knew him gave him a baby-sting.
(Applause) Maybe that's why he became a director, and from his father, of course, but for the cinema he wanted.
I wanted my children to learn about Greece.
And what stories more real would be to tell them in my childhood with my sister in Samos.
Because these were my most beautiful memories.
And there he was born "The Kaplani of the Window".
I sent it to Greece, it was a publishing, the Foundation.
I never got an answer.
And in a short time, in a year I take a time to go with my children for two months in Greece.
I'm going to the foundation.
He was a friend, a very remarkable man, Dimitris Despotidis.
I say to him, "What's going on with that Capanne?" He says, "Here's it, it's in the window."
He had published it and had it in the window.
The Kaplani of Vitrina, I confess, that if it were not for the teachers, it would not have been released, it would not have entered the schools.
Because too many have struggled for this book not to enter schools and not to enter and I, of course.
But the teachers stubbornly put it in schools and now it's fifty so many years that Kaplani is in schools.
And I, of course.
(Applause) We returned to Greece, I with the ten years, my husband with 15.
Let our children learn the language again.
They talked, of course, but to get used to Greece.
In two years the junta became and we left Paris.
New starting point.
The two years in Greece I didn't write anything.
I only translated for livelihood reasons.
In France I began to write most of my books: "Perotus' Walk", the "Mov Umbrella", as well as the "Achilleas's Fiancée" there I started to write it.
Because it was the environment that gave you the opportunity to write.
I went to French schools and I was sorry.
I say, I go to French schools and to Greek schools I can't go.
The Cape Villane was translated, got prizes and that gives you an uplift.
And when we returned to Greece, then I realized - because when I was writing Kaplani I didn't know that I was writing a book for children, I wanted to say memories of my childhood.
Now I go too much to schools, I'm going around Greece, I'm talking to the kids.
And what I tell them to young people I say to you, no matter how much crisis there is – because many times I hear, “We have war, we have a Junta” – we have no war, nor a Junta.
It is difficult years, but the hunger of the occupation is not comparable to the hunger that exists now.
And in possession we hoped for something.
And I wanted to tell you that one small thing, albeat too little, hope, will slowly become a big puzzle.
And especially to be together, to love and to help each other.
This is the best we can do today: to stand by each other.
Materials, but also mentally.
Not to be taken away by depression, children.
It's very terrible to get depressed as a people.
That's why I think we have to have a little flame inside us, a little joy, and then you'll see that everything will be lighter.
I think I've crossed the line.
(Applause)
I wake up in the morning in a warm house.
I'm packing the family's breakfast, and we're all sitting together to discuss the schedule of the day.
Today, of course, the program will be different.
Bags for school are ready.
I say goodbye to my wife, I wish her to have a good day, and I'm taking my little daughter to her primary school.
I hug her, I tell her that for whatever she needs during the day she should contact her mom, because I won't be able to talk to her.
I see her passing through the school, in the yard.
I leave, he greets me, in a way that we greet a man we will take years to see.
After half an hour, I park my car in an area of Athens.
I empty my pockets of various small items, only keep a book, my identity, and I hang up my mobile phone.
I'm starting to head to a gate.
I press a button on this gate, and as if by magic, this iron door opens.
Now I'm in a place where it's full of probes.
In one check, you know, it reminds of the airport check when it comes to traveling to another country, on an exotic island, if I've forgotten something in my pockets, I'll have to go into control again.
I surrender my ID, my mobile phone, they hold them to me, and they give me hands a card with a specific color and number.
This card, from now on, will be my passport on this strange island.
If I lose her, I might have a problem leaving in there.
Holding the card in my hands, I feel that now I have to go beyond my own personal limits.
Like I'm on a cliff, and I'm gonna have to jump into the void.
The first door opens, and then she closes hermically behind me on her own.
An iron noise can be heard in my ears.
Successively now there are iron doors that close and open, I pass through detectors, I have lost count, I don't know how many there are.
And slowly something unprecedented begins to affect me.
It's a smell.
It's the smell of prison.
Now I'm in front of a last door, which I'm going to have to open myself, and I'm gonna have to go through a room.
Inside this hall, 20-25 prisoners are waiting for me.
I'll have to meet them.
My mouth dried up from the agony.
I've seen a lot of prison movies, I've seen people who look at you with a strange look, criminals, who wouldn't have anything to say with, you'd be afraid even to sit next to them.
All these, the imaginary people, begin to turn in my head like a smar, push my thoughts and threaten me.
I take a deep breath, open the door, and get in.
A warm, smiling face comes towards me, a warm handshake disarms me.
He tells me his first name, then 20 men come to me, and they say their first name, greet me with cordiality, and ask me if I want tea or coffee.
Then we sit in a circle.
I look at them.
They're looking at me.
And then, I see faces thirsty, touched, aching.
All those imaginary people I've met outside this door are slowly starting to leave my mind.
"Good morning Stratis," they tell me, "Welcome."
For a year and a half I've been in and out of Korydallos prison.
My first collaboration was with the treatment center of dependents IN ACRASIS.
After five months, we managed to stage with 18 participants a theatrical performance titled "The Guest".
The born-again man.
The new man.
This collaboration and the texts written about it were based on Kickling's poem "Ann".
Participants wrote their own “Ann.”
Since last November I have been participating in a very important effort by Korydallos prison, the National Theatre, the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, and the General Secretariat for Criminal Policy for the creation of the first theatrical workshop in prisons that will be open to all wings of the prison.
This is very important.
(Applause) When they asked me if I wanted to take on this project I said yes, of course!
Of course, I'll take care of it.
It's time to go beyond the limits, as a man and as an artist.
Then we talked about what I was thinking of doing in relation to this theatre group, then a play by William Shakespeare came to mind: "The Tempest."
I chose this writer, why? William Shakespeare has invested.
His main works are written for evil heroes.
Shakespeare's bad heroes have committed all the crimes of the penal code.
They have exceeded all limits.
But we applaud those in theaters.
Thousands of actors every year, all over the world, make their salary.
In the Tempest, of course, there is no dropping of blood, all attempted homicide is being thwarted.
There are no wars, the action is taking place on a desert island, on an isolated island.
On this island lives the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero, along with his daughter Miranda.
He has been ejected by his brother who had thrown him into the sea.
Prospero, in his twelve-year stay on this island, conquered the greatest achievement a man can achieve.
To become master of himself, to acquire truly free will, and when with the help of the higher spirit Ariel he calls through a storm his wrongdoers on the island, then he can do them whatever he wants!
Avenge them or forgive them.
Revenge and forgiveness.
Two words that have, believe me, different meaning in prison and different meaning in the outside world.
Temperation is not only an external phenomenon, it is an internal phenomenon of people, choices, located in the extreme, at the limits, that are at the extremes, who seek the limits.
Now I'm back in the room.
I look at the participants.
Everyone expects me to say something.
You know, the hardest part of a director in creating a show is the first rehearsal.
And I wonder, what did I come to do here, what can I say to these people who have not experienced it, who have not lived it? To talk to them about the performances I have uploaded? To talk to them about the theater? And what can I tell them about the theater? And what does the theater have to do in prison?
I look at them and I see that I don't know anything about their past, I don't know anything about the journey that brought them in there.
They are not actors who came to play a role, but real people, people who came here together to share something important, something that we will have to discover together.
But I can't take a breath, and I don't know what to say.
I see a clock across the street, staring at me dangerously, as this one looks at me here.
The indicators roll, they pass the time, and then I say, this clock, looks at me and I feel threatened.
We already feel very happy, and we start talking about theatre, I am talking to them about the basic object of theatre, which is the study of man.
This complex machine that we constantly write its user guide, and we don't know exactly how it works.
Limits, functions, we don't know yet.
But in the theater we can make this choice.
The conversation is going on, and we're already starting to talk about arts, about philosophy, painting, about dramaturgy, and suddenly I forget that I'm in prison, and I think I'm somewhere, behold, like here.
And then I wonder, these people here, who are opposite me, could very well be scientists, painters, poets, and I can't understand how they got in there.
And then I understand, however, that the limits to be in prison are too few minutes: an economic debt, a dark feeling, a choice, a tempest, and the limit is lost.
We immediately start a strong improvisation.
Through the team there is a sailor.
I tell him, to tell us the adventures he went through in the seas.
He begins to talk about the Pacific, Atlantic Ocean, and all together in there, with captain this sailor, we begin to create the conditions of a ship while sinking.
It was a pleasure!
I really felt, both they and I, that we escaped.
We escaped mentally and went to a distant place, on an incredible island.
I could tell you a lot about all those moments I lived with these people as a whole.
By next June when we will raise our performance inside Korydallos prison, I will have passed the entrance of the prisons more than 80 times, and I will have worked with a total of over 50 participants.
I could tell you a lot.
Many touching human moments that are even in there.
For this meeting.
But I'll just stay in one.
When Prospero, at the beginning of the play, tells his daughter for the first time, "Now my child I will tell you who is your father, who is not king, only in a God-strict cell," one of the participants approached me at the end of the rehearsal to tell me how much these words moved him.
They reminded him the first time he would meet his child, in the prison visit, to tell him who he really is.
The rehearsal is over, time is running out, I'll have to get out.
I salute the participants, they greet me too, we managed, we managed for a few hours to escape from our prison.
I go out, take my ID again, my mobile phone, and take a big step by step out of prison.
No, I'm not going to turn on my mobile phone, I don't want to know who got me, if I have messages, or answer e-mail.
No, right now I want to enjoy it, I am outside, I am out again, and I am starting to look at the sky, to hear the birds, the trees, and the lyrics of the poet Giorgos Sarantaris come to me: "I need to go for a walk, with the trees going for a walk, in a world of good waters."
I'd like this experience of mine to share it with the walkers around me.
I look, I see them, and I see sad people, crouched faces, but is it possible? I was now in prison and those I see, who think they have no limit, who think they are free, have the right to be sad? To be sad, to be imprisoned in their views, in their attitudes, in life?
I wonder if freedom is an internal or external affair.
If those in there may be incarcerated, but real free, let us here wonder if we are real free.
If freedom means the coming of limits, then free is the man who has limits.
Where he seeks the limits.
Which each time sets new limits, to overcome them afterwards.
I'm getting in the car.
I take the book out of my pocket, I open it, and I see in a dedication: Voice: "To our director who helped us escape with the art of theatre, and who personally helped me remember again who I am."
- Thank you.
(Applause)
I'll try not to be tempted and talk about all that happened this morning.
Let me tell you, that is, the moment the Anti-Terrorist goes home...
Well, let it go.
Let's go to the established ones.
(Fneses) Let's go get started.
Well, this is my school.
It's this shop there in the corner, under a working block of flats in Agia Varvara.
I want the translators to be a little careful in this latter because there is often a confusion with Saint Barbara.
(Laughter) Let me tell you a story.
A few years ago I was invited to college, only as a guest I could go, together with Dimitris Papaioannou, of the Olympic Games, to choose the best student, who makes nice speeches etc, and at some point I was caught up with the American director of the college, a gentleman with suspenders, bow tie, tummy, a little red nose, very fond of, but very likeable, and he says to me, "What school have you finished?"Barbara."
(English): "Oh, Santa Barbara college!" he tells me.
(Laughter) I left him with the question, I made a nod, I didn't keep talking going.
Well, Saint Barbara.
This is the school, this is the tutorial.
It was a basement, there was a first floor, but it was more expensive to classes on the first floor.
This is the ball, it was in a much better view.
"Thunderbolt" ballasts.
"Thunderbolt" was also the sports team of the gypsies of Saint Barbara.
Irrelevant information.
This is through the...
I'm not here anywhere.
Because I always had a problem.
I liked to participate in the screening, photographing, etc., than to play.
Unhypocritically, I will tell you that Agia Varvara was a very nice area, that is, I grew very beautifully, there were, of course, various accidents.
But there was camping, there was a lane we were playing, there was Koutalianos, the older ones may remember him, pushing the cars.
These are all my own pictures.
I'm not on the machines either.
Fifteen, we were all getting a motorcycle.
I took a Vespa, I said that my father leaves me etc., the usual lies you tell, anyway, I took the Vespa, after a week, I turned it back.
They say, "What happened?" I tell them, "Guys, there's a problem with this Vespa."
Vespa, you remember, the old one, had the speeds at the wheel, one, two, three, four, right? I tell them, "There's a problem with this Vespa."
"What's going on?" I say, "Look, when I put first, I start too fast, but then I can't finish, whereas if I put on Wednesdays, I have a hard time starting, but then it runs a lot."
I mean, I thought the manufacturer was giving me a choice.
That is, one morning to start with the first, one day to start with a second, one to a third, a fourth.
I say this because that's how we learned things.
I mean, we were learning, we were wrong, we were continuing.
We almost learned journalism, that's how we learned.
Well, we're talking about... Oh, because we're talking about Vespa and I want to take a pause, because along with our mistakes, we had the little lies, the little myths.
I'm going to the most painless today.
We've all heard this line that Vengos has first said, "Do you know from Vespa?"
Well, from a very young age I had noticed in that film the black and white that Bengos drives this or leads this.
You know little about a machine, you know this isn't a Vespa.
And because I know more than that, I tell you it's a Zounap.
Zundaup was a machine that came out in the 60-'70s.
In '84, German Zoudap went bankrupt, and was bought by the Chinese at the time.
So, since then, there was both bankruptcy and German and Chinese.
In other roles, though.
Well, Well... (Laughter) (Applause) But we're talking about returning to our history, in 1981, a very old time.
Very old times? I wonder at times.
Because I have the feeling that many times, reality makes a loop.
That is, the same persons, the same events and simply the subtitles change.
I don't know if you agree.
Be careful.
PASOK, A' Athens, Manolis Glezos.
Elections of 1981.
Manolis Glezos, of course, is the bestower of power, as the powerer of power is today.
And then me with a dungeon, today with a microphone, a small variation.
Well, we're talking about 1981, to retire this, it's wrong.
We are talking about 1981 and I want to transfer to the protagonists of today, starting with my friend, the little one.
Let's go.
Stavros Theodorakis: What are we going to talk about? Kyriakos: About the school.
SS: I thought we'd talk about girls.
K: The school is ahead, though.
SS: Okay, school.
What class are you doing? K: Tuesday.
TH: Tuesday.
I've learned a good student, eh? K: Mmm. TH: The favorite lesson? K: Mathematics.
SS: Isn't it difficult for maths? K: If you know pregame, not difficult.
SS: Do you know good prepaedia, right? Quick? Q: Yes.
TH: Tell me, let's say the eight.
that still makes it difficult for me eight.
K: Oh, the eight we haven't learned, we've learned six, five.
SS: Tell me six.
One six, six, six twelve, three or six eighteen, four or six twenty-four, five or six thirty, six thirty, six thirty-six, seven or six-twentieth, six or eight forty-eight, nine or six fifties.
TH: Nice.
All tens, so, Q: A few tens, a few nines.
From nine on and above.
In mathematics, of course, ten.
TH: So, will you become a mathematician? What will you become? K: Master of mathematics.
SS: A, math teacher.
Are you being listened to by the younger kids, but they?
TH: What do you tell them? K: Keep quiet.
SS: Let me ask you something difficult now.
K: Yes.
TH: If you could change something in your life... K: Mmm... Q: I would like the environment to be cleaner and to see more often all my family, my father, my mom and my brother.
SS: So this is my friend Kyriakos.
There is a view that the worst family is better, it is preferable to the best institution.
I, personally, disagree with this view.
Kyriakos lives on the OCC, has been abandoned by his parents at the Roof of Perissos, and since he was abandoned, he "flowered", hanging out with children who have been taken by prosecutors or their parents.
Kyriakos has too many dreams, as you see, as well as the other children of the OCC.
That is, constantly, what they say is not what they went through, it is what they will achieve or what they are achieving at the moment.
Ceylan.
TH: There in Thessaloniki, did you face problems? The style of the Muslim woman, the peasant woman.
Ceylan: No, No.
Thank God, no.
Okay, racism, there isn't, so, the whole department is talking to me, talking to me, we're talking, we're doing, we're raging and they know me.
SS: What are you talking about? T: I tell them what is happening in the village.
And they like it.
PS: How do you justify that you don't know the language well? Or anyway you don't know it... T: I don't know her so well.
TH: ...with accent.
You know her very well... T: Yes.
Thank you. Thank you.
SS: You speak very well.
T: Thank you.
T: T: I tell them that I am a Muslim, that my parents do not speak Greek, that I know how to read Arabic, I speak, I speak, Turkish I know very well, and for this reason I am not so well in pronunciation and they understand me.
(Music) Caylan: But I like the village.
I do what I want.
Whatever craziness comes to me.
I get up, I go down Xanthi, I go down Thessaloniki, I can collect them, gather them at home, do whatever madness we want, to see a movie, to go out.
No problem, there's no restriction.
Okay, you might be a girl you know what you're doing, you're not doing what's forbidden, but you can do whatever you want.
As long as you know what you're doing.
So I love being in the village.
I'm having a good time.
ST: Well, Ceylan is from the almost Bulgarian border, the Pomakochoria.
An area so close, but also so far away.
By '96, you'll know, to go to these villages you had to take special permission from the army.
Now, it's a big deal, because we were afraid of these people.
What matters is that Ceylan has found a very simple trick.
When he gets on the bus to Thessaloniki, he takes off the handkerchief and the colorful clothes, he wears some other sportier ones.
He is studying in Thessaloniki Economically and aspires two years from now to open the first accounting office of a local in those villages.
Let's go see Katerina.
TH: A dose in the morning? Katerina: Yes.
Every day, though.
They're giving me up, drinking it and I'm leaving.
TH: Don't they trust you to give it to you at home? K: I don't believe that's it.
It's the program strict.
This is one of the strictest in Greece.
It has happened and have lost administration for a minute.
And there's no there waiting a minute or a half.
You're not being granted, you've been sick all day.
And it has more deprivation than heroin, methadone.
SS: Are you slowly downloading the methadone? K: I expect, basically, for several things to go well in my life first before I start coming down.
That is, if I am again with Panagiotis and I see these, I do not know if in the end I will be so strong and I still have patience to continue like this.
STH: Relationships? Panagiotis: Relationships? SS: Do you have? Can you? P: Na.
Elsewhere is my mind.
TH: What? Katerina: Well, we sleep together like two friends... SS: What? Can't? K: ...for a long time.
P: It's elsewhere.
Humiliating, but it's elsewhere, my child, okay.
Humiliating, not for manhood and well, humiliating in general.
TH: Katerina was in the pinch, in heroin eight years, at some point she decided on her own, she entered a program of substitutes.
He's done it.
Of course, in a country where you find heroin on the street, than substitutes or medication to quit drugs.
Katerina's big bet is whether she will go again to her friend's "world" or whether her friend will return to her own "world".
Let's go see Marina.
Marina: I will never forget the loudspeakers shouting: "Litwinova, he is released."
Who, say, it came out, the whole wing to say goodbye.
From the emotion and the tears, I didn't see, I didn't distinguish faces, only when they hugged me and gave me the wish in the ear, I was trying to figure out who it was.
That day I collected too many wishes.
I think they accompany me so far and give me strength.
TH: Does prison ever turn like a nightmare? M: Too often.
And in the smallest things, I often think about prison.
When I leave the house and lock the door and play with the keys in my hand and go to work or university, I am in the face of joy.
And I thank God.
That I have keys, that I have a house, that I have a job.
It's like a dream that I live.
ST: Marina stayed in prison for about three years.
At first, he was very afraid of the lifers.
Then, at some point he thought of making a handkerchief for the child of a life-woman who had a birthday.
Since then, he began to approach them.
He put them in the series, at one point, he says, "I put them in the series and I made them pedicures and I was taking telecards."
You're washing my clothes and I'm giving you a pack of cigarettes.
Exchange economy.
The main thing is that Marina came out of prison, entered law school and is one of the few cases that got a big compensation from the Greek state because she was in prison unfairly.
For every day he was in prison, about three and a half years, he got 25 euros from the Greek state.
And last is Dimitris.
TH: That is, in the morning you feel a little taller than the others who are slouded in the streets, eh? Dimitris: Why are you free.
And you're not trapped in pettiness.
You see them a little like a God, from above, from a distance, from a distance.
People are like looking for problems.
(Music) SS: More submersible designs? D: Now, we're planning with the kids for Cuba just wants me to do my treatment before to be ready to endure there.
SS: The samba to withstand? D: No, more so in the heat.
Because we're struggling in the heat.
But, it's worth it.
SS: Dimitris, I met him, on such days, last year.
Dimitris suffers from a very rare disease, cystic fibrosis, which is the deadliest hereditary disease of the white race.
When he was born, life expectancy was ten years.
He turned 20, he's 30, and now the doctors think he's going to be 40.
Dimitris, when he learned that the limits are too small instead of abandoning the weapons, entered Architecture, founded a club that changed Sismanoglio, that is, many cystic hollow children dynamically changed the conditions of treatment in Sismanoglio and continues and, of course, I believe that he will defeat all the statistics.
Dimitris, therefore, who fights and defeats death, Marina, who goes against the mistakes of the state, the children who try to correct their mistakes, Ceylan who goes against the conservative environment of the country and its community and my friend who tries to defeat the social exclusion.
That's what I wanted to tell you tonight.
I wanted to tell you, that's the old road.
That man possesses a momentury that can make him defeat exclusion, immobility, perhaps death.
Thirst, that is, for what we do not have can lead you against the river and get you across.
(Applause) In the past, our socialization was the work of the family.
Exclusively.
Then the school was added.
Then the media were added.
Now, social media is slowly being added.
A little parenthesis.
I wonder too many times if I grew up in an environment where everything was in front of me.
If, that is, discoverable pages by pressing the button on a keyboard.
Where would my curiosity stop? Did this discovery suffice me and I didn't go to the next discovery? Anyway, it's another matter.
What I want to say, in closing, is that television, as the strongest means, must, among other things, give space to this drive.
That is, he has to teach people to listen to their momentum.
That's what I think I'm doing with the "Protagonists" or rather, to be precise that's what I and my protagonists do, believing that the momentury can successfully contrast the unmoved fate.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
