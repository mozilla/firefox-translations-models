At the age of 12, it was the first time I had to face myself.
It was the year I started playing sports and switched schools.
I was now a student at my hometown music school and was in my late teens.
My classmates were talented children with a variety of interests.
Others were playing music, others were playing football, and others were just better than me.
Or at least that's how I felt.
I felt that I was lagging behind in many areas compared to my peers and what I had in mind that I could be and be in the future.
Think about it, I was overweight, shy, and unpopular.
This situation I thought was not worth me, so I started looking for ways to change it.
My first move was to Google, as we all do now, how to become better, smarter, how to gain impressions in a group, and I continued to do all sorts of similar searches.
I started reading self-improvement books and articles every day.
At one point I thought that a very good option besides the articles on the Internet would be a book that would have a concentrated knowledge of me.
And I even went to a bookstore.
I learned about techniques and methods that could help me improve and tried to apply them.
I studied body posture, tone of voice, speed of speech, and tried to control the tone of each conversation.
Somehow, as you can see, it was very difficult to do all of these things from scratch, all of a sudden, and study them all at the same time, and it was utopian to think that I would do it so simply.
Somehow I realized that theory from practice was so lacking, and somewhere there I began to believe that I would never get where I wanted to go and with the disappointment on my face growing ever greater.
And then, an event had to change my whole theory of life, and on several things, at least as I perceived them to be about myself.
It was a simple proposal from a teacher at my school, to take part in a large short film competition.
We took part and were recognized among the best teams in the competition, and that was the moment I realized something very important.
The next day after our success, I asked myself a few questions.
What made me feel happy and relieved when I achieved them; why I believe I can't pursue my dreams; why I'm afraid of losing something I never had, and why the fear of failure overshadows the fear of victory; what I really want out of my life and what my purpose is; every day very strange things happen around us.
Millions of people are born and die at the same time without realizing that we coexisted or coexisted with them for a period of time.
Billions of people have completely different ideas and perceptions and beliefs than we do.
And there are those people who we consider rare and unique and we are happy and happy to be around.
But they and the rest of us all have one thing in common.
This is the time between birth and death that we call life.
Life, then, as you all know, is not a playful laugh, right; it's a mistake!
Life is like playing, laughing, crying, claiming, risking, winning and losing.
Life, then, is a very big game and has many parameters and many rules.
Some of the rules are known to us from the beginning, and some of the other parameters and rules are learned later when we play this game.
A very important part of games is to define your own framework and rules from the beginning so that you can achieve the desired result.
You basically have a goal you're trying to reach and achieve, and that can only happen if you move it right.
But what is the right path that will lead you to the goal; there is probably no right path.
There is only one road that you can make.
And if the path you have chosen leads to the goal, then your reward comes.
This scenario reminds you of something; hmm, that's pretty much what happens in our lives.
You see, games are connected and have been influenced by life.
Do we think that this should be the case in our lives; we often think that this is our last chance to succeed, we live by deadlines set by others for us, and this makes us fear failure, resulting in many times doing wrong or sometimes not doing at all.
Now imagine what our lives would be like if the games had influenced us.
First of all, there would be no fear of failure, because we all know that in games you always get a second chance.
Even when the lives and opportunities in your game diminish, you are able to increase them and make life and the game last longer.
After all, why not do the same in our lives; every time we fail at something, we automatically increase our success rate on the next attempt.
If you think about it, that's wonderful!
Another important element that we often spot in games is time.
If you've noticed, usually, many games don't get harder but faster.
This is true in real life.
For example, today, here, I could have given a better speech in my own game, but the TEDx production set a specific time frame for me to speak, thus making the game faster, not harder.
So, because we know that our time in this game is limited and the spider only spins once, we determine our own degree of difficulty in relation to it.
Most of the time we judge that it is either hard enough for us or that we are not in time.
Think about that for a moment.
We are bound to the same thing, seeing the two differently.
This confusion often leads us to inaction.
The way to get out of this is to have a clear purpose in our play and, in turn, to extend our life.
Time is the only asset we have.
It's that lizard that when you turn it, you suddenly start to feel the pressure to act.
This is your own key to help you lock the door of inactivity.
And you need to lock it properly because it will find many ways to escape in order to create confusion and lead you astray.
So if you can believe and see life as a big game, then you are likely to find your destination.
You will realize that you are the protagonist of this game and will begin to look for the rules to follow and all your potential opponents.
Then you will discover a very large gap.
There are no rules to follow and usually there are no opponents who want to win you over.
It's you, the actions and the time.
What exists is your time and your actions.
Even time is a human invention, which you will never be able to understand, and when you realize this, you will realize that you are fighting completely alone.
So all the weight falls on you and the actions you will take.
In secondary decisions of importance, it is useful to consider the pros and cons.
But in critical matters, decisions should come from your heart.
Success is hidden within you.
So listen and feel your heart and let it show you that strategy for your game.
Depend on a target and chase it.
If you succeed, you will enjoy the result.
If not, you've enjoyed your trip.
In any case, you've discovered why it's worth the risk, why it's worth the claim, and why it's worth the gamble.
Those who have a γιατί to live on can endure anything  as Nietzsche has said.
This is why we are all called to answer it.
The day you discover it will be the most important day of your life.
Seek within yourself without fear and you will find it.
I found it a few years ago after a simple contest.
Now it's your turn.
Thank you, El.

To get our economy back on track to sustainable growth, we'll need to change jobs halfway to a million people.
That is, 10 to 20 percent of the workforce.
And when I say change jobs, I don't mean to work more productively or more hard or more honestly or smarter.
I mean, change the subject of activity.
And let's see why.
If we divide the economy, the branches of the economy into two categories: Left-wing, non-commercial, that is, those that cannot be offered from afar and therefore are not subject to international competition.
And on the right are the commodities, that is, the products that can be transported, the industrial, or the agricultural, the services that can be offered to foreigners.
Tourism, shipping and various forms of technology are commerciable, as is software.
The problem with our economy, the structural, beyond the fiscal, is that we have very few jobs on the right and relatively many on the left.
And to get it right, hundreds of thousands of jobs will have to come from there, here.
Let's look at another category.
To divide them into sectors that need large and organized enterprises, which means capital, hierarchies, etc., and those that could be and are being done today by small businesses.
Those who talk about investments and hope that business with investments will come in the first place, actually hope that business will come in ready-made packages, here, above, in the big competing companies well-planned, spaced, with their hierarchies and equipment.
And indeed, this is the international standard of an extrovert economy.
The big industries, the big companies in competing industries are the ones that export or those that prevent the large penetration of exports from outside, which defend the domestic market.
In our case, this model cannot dominate.
And the reason is that our entire society, our entire institutional environment, is conspiring to keep us from having too many large companies in competitive industries.
At the moment, not even 5% of the workforce is working in large enterprises up there.
And when I say big, have more than 250 employees, not huge ones.
Not even 5%.
About 25% work in large organizations or in the state, and especially in the state, in non-marketing sectors.
And 70% is the SMEs.
And of that 70%, at least half are self-employed and farmers.
The big adjustment we have to make is therefore that the entire non-marketable sector and the entire unemployment pool create jobs here in the small, exporting, out-of-market economy.
Now, this is an orbit that is not at all common internationally.
We have no standards to copy.
We'll have to create our own orbit, quite peculiar, quite Greek.
Greek households will succeed because they have certain elements that do not exist in a very large area in the West.
First, the self-employed and small business owner has commercialism.
He knows how to handle receipts and payments.
He knows how to start new jobs, which a senior executive of a large western company who has'made his career in a hierarchy' doesn't necessarily know.
Then there is the famous Greek family's multi-tasking.
Different sources of income, different assets, a field from here, a rent from there, a pension, the wife's salary in the public sector that is stable, etc. And this is important because; because the international surveys, statistical surveys, about what are the key factors that motivate someone to become an entrepreneur, to start a new business of their own, the most significant factor statistically is to have a discount, a small fortune, something.
This factor is statistically more important than even character elements.
So I think that Greek households have all the elements to make this big move I talked about.
And so I don't think it's hard to imagine a literary scholar leaving the nursery and going to tourism, or an engineer returning to his hometown farm and trying something new, a new crop, - no innovation has been found for the industry as far as I can see - or 3 new technicians designing applications for the global digital economy, some of the best of which we have here today.
There will be too many obstacles.
And one of the greatest is the standards we carry in our heads.
The standards we carry in our heads will be one of the biggest obstacles, standards for what; for example, what is a good job.
For me, for my child.
Or what kind of businesses are the best for the national economy.
In 1980, the prevailing Western standard was that growth meant industry.
And we, our standards happen to be......and we don't work it out rationally.
As Stellar would say, we import them.
There are prevailing Western narratives that fit the West but may not fit us.
Well, in the '80s, the prevailing standard was: "Development means industry".
And that is why Andreas Papandreou, the gifted Andreas Papandreou, had said then, if you remember: 'We will not become the garsonia of Europe'.
And it colored tourism negatively for many years.
Imagine if he had said: "We want to be the hosts of all Europe".
Come here, meet each other, have fun, have fun, search.
How different a story would be for tourism.
Today, a prevailing standard says that development is infrastructure and organization.
And this is true to some extent, to some extent.
But for us, we must strike a wise balance between this infrastructure and organization of one and our own particular characteristics.
And let me continue with an example, tourism.
Foreigners to come to our island would land on the free Venizelos.
They will come into contact with an organized airport, which only large organizations and infrastructure and projects can have.
The top of the painting I showed you earlier.
But they obviously aren't coming for the airport.
Then they will board a boat, which if fast and clean, will get them to their destination ready and rested.
And the ship is obviously only a large company that can operate it properly.
But again, that's not why the boat is coming.
The reason they come is that after the boat leaves them on the island, what will they do there; they will go to the small business and hire a pig and start the adventures.
Okay, and they'll get here.
And they'll be lying here.
And they will pass through the company's cash register and pay here.
And in the afternoon they will go and buy honey produced by another small business in its facilities, which are these.
Well, the airport and the boat are not our product, they are the way to get to our products.
Which are the pig walk, the beach, the tavern, etc. And these are all offered by the little ones.
And to explain, I'm not saying that small rooms to Letel are better than large hotel units.
What I'm saying is that since we either don't want or can't have many large units, the success of tourism will be judged by small professionals.
How hospitable they are, how creative they are, how environmentally friendly they are, and how convincing they are to convince the customer to pay without feeling that they are stealing from them.
So I think the airport and the pig is a good illustration of our overall development model.
We need the good infrastructure that only planning and big hierarchies and big capital can provide, and in this we should not be different from the West.
We must have these standards.
But what will determine our position in the global economy, which will not be the same as the Germans or the Chinese, will be small business owners who must find ways to sell their products everywhere.
Where can we rely; besides the crops or tourism that we naturally have advantages; there is a cliché that says: To our youth, their intelligence and their education.
Because they are open-minded, traveling, speaking languages, and many of them even study at the best universities in the world.
This one has some substance.
So based on these data we can have some successes.
But I believe not too many.
Where we can have more is if we combine these elements, intelligence and education, with some local peculiarities, which I must tell you no one else can tell you.
Neither I nor anyone else.
These are discovered by entrepreneurs every day, by small business owners from work to work.
Let me give you an example.
The books for learning foreign languages.
The so-called foreign language books are mainly English-language.
I know at least 3 Greek publishers, which are very successful internationally.
One of them was recently bought by a multinational company and the other two are major exporters.
From time to time, Greek publishers have been involved in learning English.
We have the following peculiarity.
In most countries, children learn English at school and their books are bought either from large multinational or local publishers, one or two with long-term contracts.
We here, we don't teach English in school.
We learn about them in the nursery, which has six thousand in Greece, and where each decides which books to get and then decides again next year.
Thus, a very competitive market for publishers to learn English has been created, of which there are about 15 at the moment and most are local, Greek.
The other feature of Greece, the peculiarity of it, is that Greek students want to have finished English, with care and exams at 16.
Because then they have to start the other care facilities, the pan-Greek ones.
This, then, creates a need for teaching methods that are more concise and faster.
Faster than those developed by multinational publishers.
And so, in this unique way, Greek publishers created products that are internationally competitive.
By stepping on a Greek institutional singularity.
Now be careful.
How many would admit that this training in nursing, which some derisively call a prank, has created a competitive international expertise that the official school will never produce.
These are the dominant narratives, the dominant patterns I spoke of before that sometimes hinder us.
And let me give another example; there is a Greek business model, the Internet Cafe, where students go out in the evenings and play online adventure games with their friends.
This model is an international prototype.
There is no such thing as a "tel" in Europe.
And it is very beneficial for the students because it develops a spirit of cooperation after playing together, and of course other complex skills, things that the Greek school of course does not give them.
But the state is dealing with Internet Cafes with enormous suspicion that there is gambling behind them.
And he tries in various ways to close them.
And entrepreneurs cannot defend their work by invoking European standards because they are not comparable.
In other words, their uniqueness, which could be an advantage, becomes a disadvantage because of the state's suspicion.
In 1976, in my first job, I worked on a research project for the Ministry of Education and the World Bank.
And various foreign advisers came to help us with the work.
At some point, a professor of economic history from a very large, well-known American university appeared.
We were then in a building on Ermu Street.
At a break from work, he asked me about my dissertation - I was doing one at the time - which dealt with the monopoly concentration in Greek industry.
I myself was greatly influenced at the time by neo-Marxist theories of development.
The neo-Marxist theories of development that spoke of the dependence and underdevelopment of the European region.
So when he asked me, I started telling him about capitalism's capitals that have all the technology there, and how underdeveloped my country is.
He listened very patiently and at the end he said, "All right, but you've noticed the coffee machine's disc;" and he meant... this.
That's what he meant.
So he explained how wonderfully designed it is, to touch the fingers gently and with the weight of the glass stabilizing and when the coffee maker goes up and down the cabinet stairs, the water does not spill.
And he says to me, "I have never had such a well-designed record in America.
And I confess that he left me devastated.
I told him about the big stories and he told me about the coffee machine.
I learned something that day.
That you don't learn real economics by reading, you learn it by observing.
And that technology is not just what's in Intel's labs, but the choices every professional makes every day.
You'll tell me why I say this; I'm obviously not saying that records will save our economy.
I say this because I think Nikos Anagnostu, the tech blogger, is right when he wrote in a recent post very nicely: "Extroversion doesn't have to be impressive".
Competitiveness doesn't have to be impressive.
Well, our new outwardly small businesses will not fit into any big narrative, nor will they have the official blessing of the state that has, say, a pharmacy today.
They will not be considered a job, nor will they have the confidence of the public, nor the pride of a career in a large company, nor have they copied successful models from Business Week.
It will be spontaneous, it will look like us are shallow and Balkan and mysterious.
Owners alone should invent the narrative that gives meaning and duration to what they do.
The rest of us should not underestimate them because they are the ones who will make us feel better.
Thank you, El.

Hello, you.
When I was asked to speak at this year's TEDxAcademy, the first obvious question, of course, was what the subject was, and I confess the answer bothered me.
"Evolution", I was told.
I can tell you about many unpleasant developments in my country, but that's not the issue.
I thought about it for a while, and I didn't want to say no.
The invitation was an honour, and suddenly what the younger ones call "flattery" came to mind.
A little inspiration.
And I said that here Europe, 60 years and more, is doing the most impressive, revolutionary, political experiment.
Well, let me tell you about it.
Let me tell you the good news, and let me tell you the bad news, and I will conclude with a few words about Greece.
Well, my topic today is the Europe experiment.
What were the goals of this experiment, which began in the 1950s; first, the establishment of peace in a Europe with open borders.
Remember a small, fragmented continent with many states carrying a long, glorious history behind them, but full of wars and bloody conflicts.
The second objective: to achieve economic prosperity by creating a large, free, competitive European market, but at the same time creating the tools that would help the least developed countries and regions of Europe to converge.
The third objective: strengthening democratic institutions, especially in countries with a troubled political history.
And the fourth goal: the application of the ancient saying: Power in the union, that is, in a world that changes too quickly, in a world that size counts, European countries, even those that were never large and tough, no longer have the specific weight or size to be the leading actors on the world stage, nor usually the secondary actors.
Those were the main goals.
What are the means we use to achieve these goals; first, the establishment of a culture of cooperation and dialogue.
In Europe, we are elected and negotiated to death.
It is infinite.
But, to tell you the truth, I would rather have seventeen hours of negotiations, even after midnight, than shoot each other, as we have been accustomed to doing for centuries in Europe.
And a second means: the creation of common institutions and policies, on which this culture of cooperation will be based.
You'll tell me all this sounds nice in words, but in practice what can be done; my answer is simple: that too much has been done.
Europe was unrecognized in 50 years.
And you want me to tell you differently; what is the proof of the success of the European political experiment, at least until recent years; think of Europe as a small shop, starting in the 1950s, is small, poor, sells only two products, essentially coal and steel.
These were the two products that launched the European Coal and Steel Community.
And with six members.
Today, this small store has grown into a huge supermarket, selling everything, although always of different quality, and has also grown its customer base tremendously.
We have grown from six members to 28 and many more are joining the entrance to enter.
I don't think there is a more compelling proof of a store's success than continually increasing your turnover and customer base.
And to add something else, and to consider yourself, until relatively recently, a model for the rest of the world.
We have good news, but let's get to the bad news.
And there is bad news.
Europe has entered a crisis.
The crisis is deep.
You will tell me that Europe has had many crises in the past.
My answer, however, would be that this crisis is fundamental, it risks becoming an existential crisis for the European political experiment.
Why, then, is the crisis; let me give some explanations.
Obviously, the list is not exhaustive.
One of the first reasons Europe is in crisis is because sometimes, probably, we have moved too quickly, without sufficient preparation, without considering the consequences of our actions.
I'll give you a very simple and characteristic example.
It is the example of the euro.
In Europe, in the early 1990s, we decided to create a common currency.
This is the culmination of the European political experiment.
It is the most advanced stage of political development.
But, we have created this common currency, but we have not created the institutional or political background on which it will be based, nor the economic tools that will make the euro viable.
In other words, we have tried to repeat in politics and economics the miracle of the innocent arrest.
That is, a currency without a state.
No state-less currency has ever existed in history, and we learn this from the "hard way", as the Turks also say.
That's the first explanation.
The second is that we were unprepared, but we were also unlucky.
Why did the euro not reach its tenth anniversary and the biggest international financial bubble since 1929 break?
No one could have predicted it, that's bad luck.
So it's also a lack of preparation and, obviously, bad luck.
There are, however, other reasons.
The third category refers to reasons related to the interior of our countries.
What has happened in the last 20-30 years; in European countries, but also in all developed countries of the Western world; economic inequalities are constantly widening.
This is much more pronounced in the US and Britain than in most countries in continental Europe.
At the same time, the number of our fellow citizens who feel they are losing, that they can no longer cope with the competition that is being created, that are losing from globalisation and European integration, is constantly increasing.
These people are turning against globalization and against Europe.
If no solution is found, the problem will worsen in the coming years.
And the fourth reason is: it's not even the best neighborhood.
Let me remind you, if you look at the map of Europe, we only have neighbourhoods to the east and south.
In the north there are only polar bears and in the west we have fish.
So, then, we are dealing with neighbors in the East and South.
These neighbors are not doing well.
Most of Europe's neighbors are in the category of globalisation losers.
And to all this economic problem came the war and religious conflicts of recent years.
One of the consequences of all these problems in our neighborhood is the huge increase in immigration flows.
The migration crisis is in danger of turning Europe into a crisis in which the euro crisis will crumble, and a crisis that could blow Europe up.
Europe certainly needs to show solidarity with people who are being persecuted.
He needs to discuss a fairer distribution of weights.
But, there is a third prerequisite.
And this is the effective control of the external borders of Europe in general, and of Greece, as they are in the whole of Europe.
So, with this crisis in recent years, we have reached a situation in which our coexistence within the EU becomes difficult.
The discontent is growing, and the acceptance of the European political experiment is declining steadily.
And that is why this sometimes seems like a cohabitation, which I called in a book I wrote last year and published in several languages, "The Unfortunate Union", meaning that Europe is in danger of becoming a cohabitation in a polygamous relationship in which partners live together, not so much because they love each other, but because they fear the cost of divorce, or because they fear being alone.
You'll tell me that fear holds many marriages together.
But I don't think that will be enough for a successful European coexistence.
And now a few words about Greece.
As you know, Greece has been an integral part of this European political experiment for many decades.
Greece's relationship with Europe has been difficult, sometimes very episodic.
I would say that the people of Greece, our fellow citizens, those who at least consider our participation in the political experiment the European one, a positive development, can be divided into three broad categories.
The first category is our fellow citizens who believe that Europe is like a cow you grind as much as you can.
These people usually have a very relaxed attitude about how common rules are applied.
The rules are either Greek or European.
A second category considers Europe as the safe anchor for a ship, the Greek one, which often seems unstable, because the crew members constantly fight with each other, because they do not let the captain take the wheel, because everyone has a different view of where they should go.
And this often unstable ship is also forced to travel through very difficult seas.
Because the neighborhood of Greece is difficult.
So, in this category, Greece offers a safe anchor.
There is a third category, which I think is less of a category.
Although, I think, the most suspicious.
They are the ones who from the beginning considered our participation in the European political experiment as an additional, not the only, means to achieve a goal that goes back far, to the Greek Revolution, if you will, or even before: the creation of a modern European state in Greece, a rule of law with strong democratic institutions, economic prosperity and social solidarity.
Apparently, these three categories were always the vast majority of Greeks and Greek women.
There were, of course, always others.
Others, for whom Europe says nothing, never mean anything, perhaps because Europe represents what they call the same judicial values and a judicial democracy, which does not satisfy them.
Either because some others imagine a Greece in another part of the world that is not exactly clear where it will be.
Of course, in recent years, with the Great Depression, extreme nationalists have also emerged from the caves.
So, then, this crisis in Europe is changing the internal balance within the country.
Greece, unfortunately, has in recent years become the most problematic member, certainly of the Eurozone, and possibly of the entire European Union.
The big question, of course, is, Who is to blame for all this; I don't have the time, about three minutes, to answer that question.
I'll answer you directly.
I believe that the management of the Greek crisis of recent years will be, is already, but much more so in the future, a course that will be taught in more and more universities, not only in Greece, but internationally.
Because it is exactly the example of a crisis that tells you what not to do in a similar crisis.
And the responsibilities concern not only, to be fair, the political leadership of our country and society in general, but also our European partners and the International Monetary Fund.
It is, in other words, a realization of a huge, immense responsibility for a failed crisis management to date, the cost of which is certainly too high.
And I get to the end.
What we are doing now; Europe must certainly change if it is to overcome the crisis.
I know that at TEDx the speaker or speaker who comes here is expected to deliver a positive message.
We need optimism.
If I were to bring you only a positive message, I think I would be kidding you.
What is at stake in Europe today is enormous.
There is certainly a possibility that this crisis will be overcome by a more united and transformed Europe.
But the danger of Europe being torn apart or even partly disintegrating is actually visible.
And the first thing I wanted to tell you all is that you should think that the success of the European political experiment is a matter for all of us, it is something that directly concerns all of us and our children.
If Europe's political experiment fails, this country will be one of the biggest victims of failure.
So, as active citizens of the European Union, do your best to contribute, as far as possible, each and every one of you to the success of this European experiment.
And finally, something else.
Europe certainly needs to change.
But I believe that before Europe can change, we must change Greece.
We must finally be honest, look in the mirror, take responsibility, see what's wrong with this country, try to free the country from its bonds.
Only when we start changing Greece will we have a credible and valid reason for how Europe will change.
Thank you very much.

Let's talk about the ideas.
The ideas are alive.
They come to us through questions, images, coincidences, and even dreams.
They are attractive.
They excite us, lead us to wonderful paths, which are full of challenges and full of unexpected developments.
They give us strength, but they also have their own dynamics.
A dynamic that helps them evolve and influence more and more people, who feed them and thus maintain the unabated excitement and inspiration they breathe.
Although I have prepared a speech and prefaced it, I hope, well enough to tell you today, I am sure that the ideas and contributions that come up will likely differ from what I wanted to say, but let's get started and see.
The German philosopher Edmund Husserl had described that every human being is the center of the world.
And that's because he sees the world with it as a starting point and a measure of comparison.
What describes the point núul púngτ, as he called it, is that each person has a completely personal view of the world, which passes through his emotional or logical filter.
We could say as Greeks: between Apollonius and Dionysius himself.
This balance between our two sides has gradually begun to wane.
And that's because logic is beginning to dominate.
Although we perceive the world primarily through experience - that is, we describe a distance, not in meters, but in minutes to walk it - we try to calculate everything.
We could say: square them.
The ideas that brought me here today are architecture, but especially an architecture that seeks to satisfy the conditions of modern and future man, but through the bridge of emotion and logic, from the experiential to the metrical space.
All modern humans are active.
We can see this from the intense rhythms of life and often from the frequent change in our lifestyle.
The established architectural immobility does not seem to satisfy this condition.
And so the first idea I'll talk about is flexibility.
Flexibility is not new - and I personally have often applied it within an architectural context, whether as research or practice.
But I understood its true dimension from another occupation.
As a director and assistant director at the amateur theater I was a part of.
There, mainly because of the challenge of creating the right environment with the greatest impact at the lowest cost, I often made the sets with multifunctional objects.
That is, objects, which depending on how they were placed in space and what orientation they had created a completely different sense.
The sense that was necessary to convey this sense that the theatrical performance wanted.
This very dimension, that is, how we understand the environment differently, I considered as a key element of variability, something I had been researching and I think I understood enough to gradually lead me to the creation of a theory that optimized the use of space over time.
That is, we could make the best use of space and time so that we would not waste it.
This is called spatial economy.
But the theater, in fact, has led me to something else that has interested me: the place of man in architecture.
The human position, in theory, is central to design.
Nevertheless, what I have found is that it is more involved as dimensions.
And not as a biography.
In directing and cinematography, the basis is an action, an activity, and the human being is always the focus of it.
Space fills him up.
It complements it as an expression, it complements it as a more general feeling.
And here I had another idea.
That architecture, perhaps, should be more concerned with this sense, with this experience, coming out of the activity, rather than in any other way.
So, it was born - or rather, because this was something that was already working - activity-based design, that is, activity-based planning.
This is a design direction that has a qualitative difference from conventional design.
That: He does not understand activity as a fractional use, which leads to ergonomics, but as a whole.
As something that has a time imprint and varies in experience over time.
This thing, this dimension, this perspective, means that we enrich the architectural question beyond ergonomics.
With other features, so that the architectural response is better.
Here I want to emphasize the following: The role of architecture is to give answers.
The answers depend on how well the questions are answered.
A well-formulated question means a better answer.
And in our case: a better architectural solution.
Thus, the creation of a methodology, enriched with more issues to which space should be addressed, led to the formulation of spatial needs around an activity, to better identify them, so that architecture could come to dress them.
Thus, the logic of dynamic building programming was created, which in turn led to the creation of an online platform where people, through an application they are probably already using, such as Google Calendar, can go through the activities they have and thus better understand their spatial needs or what kind of space they need to make them better.
And in this way, in principle, to assess the existing spaces they have, but also to better identify future ones based on their future needs.
This application, of course, could not be carried out without extensive information.
I belong to the generation that has lived through the entire transition into today's digital culture, so to speak.
I was 13 when the first personal computers came out, and I was, perhaps, one of the first to get involved with it.
In fact, it was a secret activity, as it was not very popular at the time because we had the girls.
And I've seen the whole passage as little by little everyone started to get involved.
In fact, to such an extent that some of my old friends and I discussed that we should probably stop doing it because this acceptance of mass is strange.
The point is that these two, that is, this digital age, have brought to us all two, say, basic concepts in our lives.
The one about automation and the one about interconnection.
Automation is something that is done for us without our assistance.
That is, it is something that is considered beneficial, it is programmed in such a way that it happens without us spending time and energy.
These two are so intense today, so widespread, so given, that their absence is really unpleasant to us.
This means that it makes perfect sense for both of these technologies to be integrated into the space.
That is: it is a logical next step and that leads to robotic architecture.
Robotic architecture - the research I have done and my work with it - has shown with clarity and certainty that it is applicable.
In other words, the technical problems I considered, in its implementation, seemed to solve everything and actually solved.
I was so excited about it.
It is essentially the height of the variability in architecture.
It's actually the combination of many ideas with different starting points that came and completed a puzzle, a puzzle, which I thought was complete, that is, whether from a theoretical, methodological or practical point of view, all the pieces were laid out so that robotic architecture could be applied.
So I thought that a larger idea had been shaped and completed.
I was so excited about what I was doing that I even wrote a book about it.
The point is, however, that, as I told you before, the ideas are alive.
And this came to prove something simple to me, a door.
You'll tell me what a door did; open it.
You'll tell me what you were waiting for at a door; come on!
That's what I thought too.
The thing is, when this door opened while I was working and I was absorbed, I was upset, upset enough.
In fact, to the extent that I began to wonder why this had happened and suddenly think that perhaps one of the most important ideas I had in this area came to mind.
That is, that although something is considered useful, expected, even if we have asked it to happen, if it happens at the wrong time, it is unpleasant.
It doesn't matter what it is.
And this, suddenly, struck me with that little bell to something, which in a sense, was thundering, but I could not see it.
That is, while robotic architecture seems to have so many advantages, why is it not more widespread; and I understand why it can be annoying.
What makes communication between people unobtrusive and enjoyable is the quality of empathy and understanding.
The quality, that is, to understand, read a situation and adapt our behavior to fit that situation.
If someone does not have this ability, behaves exactly the same or similar in all possible situations, then a disorder is created that in turn leads to a decline in communication.
Unfortunately, robotic systems have a predictable and usually similar behavior.
And that can be great if it's a repetitive use, like putting something together or screwing a fork 24 hours a day, but when dealing with people, that's problematic, because people often change their mood and behavior.
And in order to be pleasant, you must follow it.
The integration of sensitivity and understanding into the cognitive characteristics of a robotic system has essentially given birth to the design methodology or integration of technology into architecture, Sensponsive, derived from the word sensibility, meaning sensitivity with understanding, and responsive, meaning response.
So such a system will never react to a situation unless it first understands the mood of people in space.
Of course, a system that truly fully understands all situations is far from our potential.
But what we can do and work on is dependent on the activity we want to benefit from through our architecture, studying the dominant factors.
That is, those factors that benefit her most directly.
Another feature of this application, besides the ability to understand humans, is discretion, which is what we said before that behavior must be like this in order to be appropriate to the circumstances.
This means, then, that the system tries to have the right behavior so that it is the least annoying.
Minimize this dimension and be as useful as possible.
Now you will tell me where we apply it; and how; at this moment we have two main directions, in which we are working on this theory.
One is about enhancing learning.
The goal is to create an original lecture space where the listener can stay focused longer and learn more from the lecture.
We achieve this by observing two critical parameters: one is of attention and the other is of alertness.
When the grade of these two has dropped enough to realize that the audience is likely to get the least out of this lecture, then a system of discrete interventions in the space is activated, which we have confirmed experimentally in the lab, that when they happen, they activate the audience and refresh the attention.
So with this Sensonsive intervention we get the audience of a lecture to get what it has more to give and all that remains is the lecture itself to give it.
The other direction has to do with something mixed.
It has to do with the concept of habitation and the concept of psychological balance.
The aim of this study was to find out how we can overcome the negative effects of mild stress and depression, often caused by the hectic pace of life and work in the modern world.
For various reasons, this research was ultimately focused more on extreme environments, and so we found ourselves studying and building functional prototypes of a living room for astronauts on the International Space Station.
The purpose of this system was to understand the mood of people inside, so as to change the layout and environmental conditions, so as to help them calm down, better, find a psychological balance, get more rest and endure the continuity of their mission.
In fact, this investigation has opened another door for us.
We were invited to NASA, Houston, and specifically the Human Research Program, as this is one of the few approaches that actually proposes a solution to improve the living conditions of humans on long-term space missions.
Something that is planned for the near future.
I think all of these ideas, and especially the framework of application that led to them, really describe a window into the future.
They describe the application of an interactive architecture that aims to create truly beneficial environments, free of negative influences.
In general, I think that should be the vision of technology.
The optimism for a tomorrow, which we consider to be better.
Personally, in order to keep this visual perspective clear, I write science fiction novels.
I'm so excited to be able to live the worlds I'd like to create.
But the key ingredient to all of this is ideas.
Ideas are alive and must be spread.
Let your ideas spread, grow, evolve, for only through them can we live the world of tomorrow, today.
Thank you very much.
(el applause)
Good afternoon!
(Applause) I would like to talk to you today about the value of truth in our daily lives.
First, we tell the truth; let's start with us here today, who of you remembers having told a truth, not having to tell which, to a friend, to a partner, to yourself, say, in the last month, to raise a hand.
Who has ever told a truth; we are telling the truth!
I'm glad, because I didn't know what the audience would say to that question.
But what we call truth is what it is; many have argued that truth is a mirror of our reality to which we do not always have access, because our senses are imperfect.
Others argue that truth is a personal matter, subjective to each of us, and changes with the course of our lives.
I would like to refer today to the truth as defined by Heraclitus, who told us that the true is the opposite of the forgotten, that is, something that needs to be revealed and brought to light.
This truth is connected with many aspects of our daily lives, indeed, it is connected with reality, reveals aspects of it to us, enhances our understanding and perception of our world, promotes self-knowledge and the authenticity of our personal expression, and very often leads to honesty and decision-making.
In my own personal path, truth has always been connected to architecture and the city.
Now you will tell me what connection the city may have with the truth; the theoretical architect Louis Mumford has told us that the ultimate mission of the city is to increase the conscious participation of man in the universal and historical process.
This multiplication of all dimensions of life, through emotional union, logical communication, technological mastery and above all dramatic representation, has been the most important task of the city in history.
This sentence made me think that our cities function as accelerators, that is, they accelerate processes, relationships, events, in which we exist, with our values and with our way of life, that is, cities create chain reactions that increase our awareness.
The interesting here is the way.
Samuel Mumford tells us that this happens through emotional union, logical communication, technological mastery, and dramatic representation.
I will today focus more on technological masterpiece and dramatic representation as I have encountered through my work.
But before we talk about technological mastery, I want to take a step back and take a look at the tools we use.
According to theoretical architects Beatrice Colomina and Mark Wigley in their book Are we Human?, they argue that the tools we make ultimately make us.
They claim, starting with Darwin's theory, that the human hand is what adapted to its tools, not the other way around.
That is, in essence, our relationship with technology is two-way, and they continue to say that human creations are interface surfaces, which, as we shape them, shape us.
Let's take our mobile phone, for example, as you all know, you may have noticed that changes in the design of the device have changed over the years and the way we behave, our habits, even our gaze and our walk have changed, so a technological device can change us.
How do we reverse this process; how could we influence this relationship; if we were likely to design our mobile phone and its applications; what would happen if we were to design all our technological tools; this question, along with many others, came to be answered by the Maker Movement.
The Maker Movement is a movement that aims to promote technology through the creation of free software and hardware.
About 15 years ago, in areas such as hacker spaces, maker spaces and other online communities, teams of inventors, researchers, programmers, began sharing technology platforms with the general public and creating new technology tools that are accessible to everyone.
For example, microprocessors such as Arduino, Arduino lilypad, Raspberry Pie among others, and related programming languages have been created with which we can easily program our own applications and create our own tools.
Basically what the Maker Movement achieved with this; it was able to bring new tools to light, to bring them out of the black box of technology that was until today for most of us.
Another thing the Maker Movement has achieved is to change our relationship with technology, make it a game, and through easy experimentation, too many of us have come close to technology to play, experiment, and often create innovative applications from nowhere.
One last and very important achievement of the Maker Movement is that it brought us together.
That is, through the sharing of knowledge, through offline and online communities, he brought us together to create, and taught us to work collectively, in groups.
But what is the value of open technologies in public space, and especially in the art space that concerns me; political scientist Santal Muf has told us that art in public space needs to challenge the given order of things, the status quo.
When technology is used in art, it needs to be used in a different way, not to repeat mainstream applications, the mainstream way we use it, to create new associations.
Why do we need this multilingualism in public space, why does it promote dialogue among us?
So our open technologies are leading in exactly that direction, because through accessibility and experimentation they allow a large group of users, both professionals and amateurs, to engage, propose new meanings and new representations in the public space.
Speaking of representations, I return to the phrase of Mumford, who told us that dramatic representation is important, and I first encountered this concept when I was studying architecture here, at the Patras School of Architecture several years ago, and I wondered which direction to take.
Between the artistic, urban design, architectural landscapes, I was a bit undecided, at one point I was doing a work that brought to the surface my love for the cultural landscape, that is, I wanted to explore the relationship of the human body and sight with its immediate natural and artificial environments through small-scale architecture.
Also at the time I was curious about technology and how technology can contribute to these experiences, so I went to London to do a corresponding postgraduate course.
In one of my first works, I began to explore these representations and the relationship between the physical and the artificial.
For example, I created the Wind chime, which is a representation of a metallic melody.
I don't know if you know it, but it's this musical instrument that we put on the porch and makes a metallic tune when the wind blows.
In my case, in my version, I replaced the metal pipes with plastic wii remote controls that I programmed to produce metallic sounds, mimic them and slowly turn them into noise.
Another representation, I explored through the Factory, this work, in which I wanted to explore our relationship with a non-physical nature, a mechanical nature, and to essentially challenge the concept of nature as we know it, to see what lies behind it.
When you light these glass panes, the chains on the roof begin to move, and eventually they are coordinated into a small choreography.
At some point, in my artistic pursuit, I decided to take another path, that of play.
So in 2011, together with two partners, we created the Athens Plaython.
The Athens Plaython is a festival of horror games and new technologies.
Back then in Athens we had very often violent demonstrations through parades on the streets of Athens, and they were accompanied by fires and disasters, and we wanted to give another voice, an optimistic voice, through play and collectivity.
And we saw our city change, we saw too many, perhaps thousands of people in the last special year, come to play with us for a couple of days and we saw the city space change.
How did this happen; through the game -- why; why; why the game has this property, to introduce us in a magical way to an inner world of fiction, that is, it can for example turn urban space into a battlefield, where different groups can negotiate a neighborhood, or start to appear as gorillas, dragons, knights and so on.
But this fictional world is not independent of urban space, but rather contains it.
That is, urban space is enhanced through play, acquiring new qualities, which are created collectively.
So I realized at that moment that for me this means of representation, the game, is important because it brings us all inside it, and creates collectives.
Later I created my own workshop Entropika with a group of collaborators, and we continue to create interactive installations in the public space, for example one of our projects, Cloudscapes, creates exactly the representation of a natural phenomenon, cloud and rain.
It essentially simulates the sound of thunder and rain, and lightning when passersby pass by.
It was another opportunity to explore how these representations affect urban space.
In fact, in this particular work, it showed a truth many years later, that while the first works were more theoretical, with ideas that I had worked too hard on, and I particularly liked them, a work like this, simpler, with a simpler idea but with a playful disposition, had much greater directness to the world, we had children trying to enchant it by shouting "abra abra", we had passers-by putting on their hooks, thinking they would boil, and we had a teenager sitting under the cloud, and as soon as he heard the lightning, Thor kept calling.
(Laughter) Along the same route, we continued with Playstools, where again we explored the playful dimensions of the objects we made, and created a hybrid version of the game musical chairs.
In this particular game, these scaffolds have these extra features, not only would we leave the physical objects, each scaffold has two touch sensors, have light, produce sound and communicate with each other via wireless network, essentially because they facilitate and can enter any space in this way.
They invite players to interact with the chess pieces in each round of play and the team that wins the most in color wins.
In fact, we want the future of this game to be an open educational platform where children, perhaps more intelligent designers than we are, can upload their own games and change the rules of the game at will.
At this point I also got a higher degree last January, because I decided to go to Mother's Italy, where I work at the Open Design School.
The Open Design School is a pilot program of the cultural capital Materael 2019.
There we are invited to design structures for the public space, which will serve all cultural events for this and next year.
These structures can be platforms, information stands, theatrical scenes and so on.
The interesting thing here is that we are again using open design tools, that is, through the philosophy of Open structures if you know, if you don't know what they are, it is an online platform, a website and a community where anyone can share their designs, freely without copyright, with the rest of the community, and anyone can develop and re-share them online.
The second interesting thing is that here too we are invited to design through play and experimentation, and this follows.
In other words, we are not called upon to design the known constructions, such as bricks that look like bricks, this can be done by anyone.
We are called upon to explore through experimentation and design mysterious, playful objects that will create questions for the inhabitants and the city, not give immediate answers.
So throughout my career I have seen that I return very often to Mumford's original question, which is what technology we need, what technological masterpiece we need, and what representations we need in the city; and the personal answer I have given is that the technological masterpiece we need must be open and accessible to everyone.
As for the performances, I have seen that many of them need to be participatory, collective and invite us to play with them.
Of course, this is my answer, it is my truth, and not every one of us needs to be involved in art and technology to see the value of truth in the city.
As you recall, Marel Mumford had said at the beginning that the truth in the city comes through emotional union and logical communication.
So our cities are us, and regardless of the status of each one of us, each of us can truly contribute to our collective life.
So today I would like to invite you to share a truth with a colleague, a partner, a friend, but above all, I would like to invite you to share a truth with yourself.
Thank you, El.
(el applause)
Because I'm an old-fashioned cutter, I take the microphone and not what's put in the ear.
Needless to say, because I see so many young people and I know they've gone through the Greek, I feel the same way tonight, and I have the same thrill, as if I had to go through the Greek.
However, I would rather be as old as I am than 18 and have to go through Greek school in Greece.
(Laughter) (Applause) Let me tell you a story, a fairy tale that has many beginnings.
Many people have a beginning in their lives.
I, I don't know why, lost too many and started a new road every time.
As far as I can remember myself, I remember him in Samoa, where I was not born, but I went with my sister who was three and a half years older than me, because our mother had tuberculosis and sent us to my grandfather and older sister.
For me, the whole world was Samos, this was Greece.
The pine trees, the sea, the grandfather - who we thought was an ancient Greek because he was a professor of ancient Greek, he was retired - only spoke to us about the ancient, told us myths, and we felt that this was a happy place that we did not want to miss at all.
And what we have seen above all is that in life, just as you put your shoes on in the morning, so you should get a book.
Because we always saw our grandfather holding a book in his hand.
When Grandpa left, I thought he had taken everything with him and it was a fresh start.
Soon we went to Athens, went to school, and at school I felt the first thing that friendship was; I became friends with Georges Sari and until the last moment, when he left for good, we remained friends.
And this, children, I say to your young people, that friendship plays a very important role in life.
In school I started reading and in fact, my sister and I loved to read poetry and especially sad poems: of Palama the Affiancé and the apostle of the Tomb I don't give you.
The Battle of the Bulge... and we cried, we read it at night and we cried.
And so something went in my head, hoping I could write a poem.
My mother had a twin brother, a beautiful - both outward and inner - man.
He was a math teacher and was engaged to a girl who was very rude to us because we considered him - and he was my grandfather - to be our own.
This girl was called Dido from above, and she had a slightly crooked nose, but had some flaming eyes.
This Dioda became our great writer Dioda Salvatore.
And many may have known her as a writer, but those who have not known her as a person have lost a lot.
At her wedding I wrote a poem.
She smiled, but when I looked into her eyes, I felt so sad and I made a decision in my life that I would not become a poet.
(Laughter) Well, I'll tell you guys the poem because it's been 82 years, and in Brussels, where I live often, my daughter came up with one night.
I'll tell you so you understand what poetry has saved, what you and I have saved.
On the morning of the drosulla, my dear grandmother, 'where I went with the boat a little to swim I saw a white jelly flying happily run to me 'tell me to go to your grandmother the Joy, τρα λα λα, τρα λα λα (Laughter) (Applause) You thought I had lost; That I could be a poet; No, I think so.
And I'm so glad I didn't become one.
I forgot to tell you that in my grandfather's house in Samoa, in the living room, there was a window and inside was a tiger, the "Cappanny".
So it was told in Samos, and I thought everyone in Greece knew it when I wrote the book Το Καπλάνι (of the Witness).
Neither Caplan nor I knew then what role we would play in our lives.
With the Dioda we learned a lot, made us want to love something, to care about something, to read of course.
The war came and Dido put us in the resistance.
And our first act of resistance we did - and Diel told us, "Don't think it's nothing, it's something big".
While my father was away at the bank, he worked in the morning and returned at noon, our house was becoming a jaffna.
Didoel brought the women of the resistance: the Elektra executed by the Germans, Melpo the Noble, Zevgu, Svolou.
They were sitting down and when they left - because they smoked like a pack - my sister and I were resisting the bar door, blowing out the smoke, and our father would come home and see that this was the situation.
We organized ourselves in the EPO and as we remember now, and many times with Zosoe, while she was alive, we sat and said, never to mention, that the years of occupation were happy years.
Because we believed in something, because we had a vision, because we believed that we were actually helping to liberate Greece.
And we had a vision that we said, when the occupation was over, we would live out our vision.
Now if we didn't get it right, it's just that... I was in the Aidanopoulos school and we had a teacher of techniques who wanted to get us out of this grief and grief and hunger and get us to think about other things and she tells us, "Children... she had studied in France at the fine arts school... we're going to do a puppet show".
He tells me, "What do you know how to do?" and I say, "Nothing".
He asked me what my name was, and he said, "You are Alki Zei", and I said, "Yes".
Because a little bit of mine had been published in the school magazine.
Dimitris Kalavros-Gusiou: I'm sorry to hear that.
Alki Zei: You can keep it for me; ΔΚΓ: Yes.
(Laughter) (Applause) He tells me, "Then write plays for the puppet theatre".
And I sat down very simply and wrote plays for the puppet theatre, which we played, and one day he said to us, 'Now look to be very nice because some friends will come; because it was the school children who were watching them.
This one was a close friend of Empiricus and brought us, not a little, Empiricus, Elytis, Mario Ploritus.
Which was brought by Marius Ploritus, a friend of his who was, along with Kun, one of the founders of the Kun theatre, named George Sebastianoglu and later became my companion.
And my sister used to say to me for a long time, 'Who are you going to date, again with the guy with the ugly surname;.'
(Laughter) Empiricus was enthusiastic about the puppet theater.
We didn't think we were doing anything important either.
We simply loved this thing we did.
And when our owners, the great people, the poets, who were very simple and treated very kindly, invited us to drink coffee at the Lumiade, we often went there and listened.
And there were other girls, I don't know why girls and not boys, didn't go.
And we listened to them, thus, with great joy and learned things.
I mean, we learned more from them than we did from the university.
In EPO, we even had parties all night because we couldn't get home late, traffic was prohibited.
And we put on a phonograph, pretended to dance so we could print illegal newspapers, press, advertisements and so on.
Of course, in the meantime we were already dancing, we were already flirting.
A boy with a long cane played the piano all night and we put black raisins in his mouth so he wouldn't go hungry all night.
And that child was Manos Hajjidakis.
(Applause) October 12 is a day that is neither celebrated in Greece nor taught in school, it was the day of liberation.
As far as I can remember, it was the happiest day of my life.
That we were freed, that we believed that all our dreams would come true.
But it didn't last long, and December of '44 began, which I wish had never existed in my life.
That's when I realized what civil war was.
What would it mean to be split in two?
What would the friend next to me say to the chair I was sitting on when we walked to the Polo, and I knocked on her door, she saw me as if she saw her biggest enemy.
And there I said, it's impossible not to love each other, the man we were close to.
And all that wildness December had, I haven't forgotten.
And now when I see the refugees walking miles to get there, I remember how we walked to escape when December was over when there was no sliding bags, we were putting up newspapers and sleeping in the dark, gunned down from above.
That's when I knew what war would be like.
That I have not been as afraid in my life as I was in December of '44.
He's fighting this too, it's over.
Some liberation came, and things began to go smoothly in Greece.
Meanwhile, I married Giorgio Sebastigoglu, and went to the Drama School.
I forgot to mention that I had written short stories and published them in a magazine called The New Voice.
I had already started writing.
And because George Sebastian was very close to Kun, I went to Kun's theater, and that's the most important thing, during the black occupation Kun taught the world about Ipsun, the American theater, the real theater.
With the hunger that was there, his actors were hungry too, but they did what is a memorable theater and its roots remain today.
So I took a sip of it myself and asked if I could go to the theater.
George told me, "I think you should write, write".
I didn't go to the school he taught, the school of the Rota, because he was sure he wouldn't take me.
I went to the school of Odysseus of Athens, taught by Rondyrus and Beakis, and it was said that Rondyrus made a stick speak.
It seems that he did a little bit of walking and talking and I finished school.
Meanwhile, the civil war is slowly starting again.
They begin to arrest people.
Tónel Giorgio is drafted into the army and secretly flies from Greece.
With a kayak and I didn't know where he went.
I was also sent to Hieu to walk.
There I met the women of Greece, who had never been outside of Athens.
I met women from Mytilene, from Northern Greece, from islands, from everywhere.
Women who came often, not for ideology, had no idea, but had mostly caught too many Mytylinias, one of their rebellious children, and brought them there, and when they were told they were free, they wept because they realized that their son had been killed.
I studied there for a year and then returned.
For almost two years, I didn't know where George was.
Until, through the Milieux, who were then in Paris, I received a letter trying to get out of Greece to find him.
At first I didn't know.
They were taken to Tashkent after the end of the civil war, and because I am unheographed, my children say that if I had known where Tashkent is, they would not have been born.
(Laughter) I managed, however, with the big ones and the big ones and got a passport and left.
And then I went to Italy, waiting for the Soviet visa, which took two years to come, and arrived in Moscow.
And when I got out of the train and saw that George wasn't waiting for me, I got hurt.
I say, "Wherever I go, wherever I am sent".
Anyway, they were there, I didn't know Russian or anything, a little French, a little Italian I could communicate.
I was put on a train and there were some strange women in uniforms, in dresses, strange people with beards.
And I traveled five nights and four days.
And I passed the Stepa, and every now and then I would ask, Taskendesh; I say go and pass the train and I go elsewhere.
Anyway, I'm here.
This time George was waiting for me.
And I learned something that immediately shocked me: that he had not been allowed to come.
'Not the Soviets, our own, the Greek party.
He was not allowed to pick me up in Moscow.
A fresh start, this time a little difficult because I had to get used to where I was, who I was, what I was doing.
I haven't written there, I'm not writing anything, I'm trying to learn the language.
My daughter is born and, fortunately, we are going to Moscow.
Because we were completely isolated from Greece, while in Moscow we could call and the ice began to break and through the Greek-Soviet link intellectuals, artists began to come.
And among the first to arrive was Empirikos, whom I had not seen for 20 years.
And I went on the train to greet him, and the performance that Empiricus had seen - for I wrote parodies, the crying I told, Odysseus's varied stories - and this play that he saw was the work of the Odysseus-loving and intellectual surrealist Kalipsos.
Because we had just learned about Surrealism.
And as Odysseus fled, she committed suicide and said, "I am a sad cornstarch".
(Laughter) When the train arrived, the first person to get off was Empirikos, and when he saw me, at age 20, he said, "Here's the sad corn".
(Laughter) And that's all that's left.
Because... (Applause) I didn't think I was doing anything important and didn't at least put a cardboard, to have a copy.
I left, they put them in a basement, the rats ate them, and there was nothing left.
In Moscow, fortunately, I began to write.
I wrote short stories, sent them to the art inspection.
And then I wanted to, because I had given birth to my son in the meantime - who Tarkovsky had been babysitting for, because he was a student and wanted to get a little paper and through a friend who knew him, he had been babysitting for him.
(Applause) Maybe that's why he became a director, and his father, of course, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
I wanted my children to know about Greece.
And what more real stories would be to tell them about my childhood years with my sister in Samoa.
Because those were my best memories.
And there was born the Chaplain of the Victorian Order.
I sent it to Greece, it was an editorial, the Tempio.
I never got an answer.
And not long after, in a year, I get a leave of absence to go with my children for two months to Greece.
I'm going to the Foundation.
There was a friend, a very remarkable man, Demetrius the Despotic.
I tell him, "What's going on with that hat?" He says, "Here it is, it's in the window".
He had published it and put it on display.
The Vitrinus Chapel, I confess, that if it had not been for the teachers, it would not have been circulating, it would not have entered the schools.
Because too many people have struggled to keep this book out of schools and not get me in, of course.
But the teachers stubbornly put it in the schools and now it's fifty years since the Caplan has been in the schools.
And I, of course.
(Applause) We returned to Greece, I was ten years old, my husband was 15.
Let our children learn the language again.
They spoke, of course, but let's get used to Greece.
Within two years, she became Huda and we moved to Paris.
A fresh start.
In the two years I spent in Greece, I wrote nothing.
I only translated it for business purposes.
In France I began to write most of my books: the Petit-Péripte, the Moffat, and even the Artavia of Achilles.
Because it was the kind of environment that gave you the opportunity to write.
I went to French schools and felt sorry for myself.
I mean, I go to French schools and I can't go to Greek schools.
The Chapel of Vitrinas was translated, won awards, and that gives you an upliftment.
And when we returned to Greece, I understood - because when I wrote The Capellar I didn't know how to write a children's book, I wanted to tell memories from my childhood.
Now I go to school a lot, I travel all over Greece, I talk to the kids.
And what I say to them and to you young people, I say to you, no matter how bad the situation is - because I hear many times, "We have a war, we have a Hunda, we have no war, we have no Hunda".
It's a tough chronicle, but the hunger of the occupation is not even comparable to the hunger that exists now.
And in the occupation we hoped for something.
And I wanted to tell you that a small thing, even if it is too small to hope for, will gradually become a big puzzle.
And most importantly, to be together, to love and to help each other.
That is the best we can do today: present ourselves to one another.
Both materially and mentally.
Let us not be taken in by the depression, children.
It is terrible to suffer from depression as a people.
So I think we should have a little flame, a little joy in us and then you will see that everything will be lighter.
I think I've crossed the line too.
(el applause)
I wake up in the morning in a warm house.
I'm making a family breakfast, and we all sit down together to discuss the schedule for the day.
Today, of course, the program will be different.
The school bags are ready.
I say goodbye to my wife, wish her a good day, and take my little daughter to her elementary school.
I hug her, tell her that for whatever she needs during the day, she should contact her mom, because I won't be able to talk to her.
I see her walking through the schoolyard.
I leave, he greets me, in a way that we greet a man who will be years away from seeing him.
After half an hour, I park my car in an area of Athens.
I empty my pockets of various micro-objects, hold only one book, my ID, and turn off my cell phone.
I'm starting to head for a gate.
I press a button on this gate, and by magic, this iron door opens.
Now I'm in a space that's full of detectors.
A check, you know, reminds me of the airport check when we're going to travel to another country, to an exotic island, if I've forgotten something in my pockets, I'll have to go through the check again.
I hand over my ID, my cell phone, they hold them, and they hand me a card with a specific color and number.
This card will, from now on, be my passport to this strange island.
If I lose her, I might have a problem getting out of there.
Holding the card in my hand, I feel that now I must overcome my own personal limits.
It's like being on a cliff, and having to jump into the void.
The first door opens, and then it closes itself behind me.
A sound of iron is heard in my ears.
Now, in succession, there are iron doors that close and open, I'm going through detectors, I've lost count, I don't know how many.
And little by little something unfamiliar begins to affect me.
It's a smell.
It's the smell of prison.
Now I am standing before one last door, which I must open myself, and I must enter a room.
Inside this room, 20-25 prisoners are waiting for me.
I'll have to meet them.
My mouth was vomiting from the agony.
I've seen many prison movies, I've seen people who look at you with a strange look, criminals, you wouldn't have anything to say to them, you'd be afraid to even sit next to them.
All these imaginary people start to spin around in my head like a squirrel, pushing my thoughts in and threatening me.
I take a deep breath, open the door, and go in.
A warm, smiling face comes to me, a warm handshake disarms me.
He tells me his little name, then 20 men come to me, they say their little name, greet me warmly, and ask me if I want tea or coffee.
We are sitting in a circle.
I look at them.
They're staring at me.
And then, I see faces that are thirsty, excited, and in pain.
All these fantastic people I'd met outside that door are starting to fade out of my mind.
"Good morning, soldier", I am told, "welcome to the camp".
I have been in and out of the Corydallu prisons for a year and a half.
My first collaboration was with the addiction treatment center ENDRESS.
After five months, we managed to put on a theatrical performance with 18 participants entitled "The Guest".
The newly born man.
The new man.
This collaboration and the texts written about it were based on Kipling's poem An.
The participants wrote their own ELAN.
Since last November I have been involved in a very important effort by the Korydallu prisons, the National Theatre, the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, and the General Secretariat of Crime Control Policy to create the first theatre laboratory within the prisons that will be open in all branches of the prison.
This is very important.
(Applause) When asked if I wanted to take over this project, I said yes, of course!
Of course I will, and I will take it.
It is time to push the boundaries, as a person and as an artist.
Then we discussed what I was thinking of doing with this theatre group, and then I came up with a play by William Shakespeare: The Trick.
I chose this author because William Shakespeare has invested.
His most important works are written about villains.
Shakespeare's villains have committed all the crimes of the penal code.
They have crossed every line.
Yet these are the ones who are applauded in theaters.
Thousands of actors every year, all over the world, earn their wages from these.
In Trichymia, of course, not even a drop of blood is spilled, all attempted assassinations are annulled.
There are no wars, the action takes place on a deserted island, on a secluded island.
On this island lives the exiled Duke of Milan Prospero, along with his daughter Miranda.
He has been driven out by his brother who threw him into the sea.
During his twelve years on this island, Prospero achieved the greatest achievement that a human being can achieve.
What; to become a master of himself, to have a truly free will, and when with the help of the higher spirit Ariel tricks his wrongdoers into the island, then he can do to them whatever he wants!
To avenge or to forgive them.
Revenge and forgiveness.
Two words that have, believe me, different meanings in prison and different meanings in the outside world.
Trickiness is not just an external phenomenon, it is an internal phenomenon of people, choices, who are at the edge, at the limits, who are at the extremes, who seek the limits.
Now I'm back in the room.
I look at the participants.
Everyone expects me to say something.
You know, the hardest part for a director, in creating a play, is the first rehearsal.
And I wonder what I came here to do, what to say to these people who haven't experienced it, who haven't lived it; what to say to them about the performances I've put on; what to say to them about the theater; and what to say to them about the theater; and what the theater has to do in prison; I look at them.
I look at them and see that I know nothing about their past, I know nothing about the journey that brought them there.
They are not actors who came to play a role, but real people, people who came together to share something important, something we should discover together.
But I can't breathe, and I don't know what to say.
I see a clock in front of me, staring at me dangerously, as this one looks at me.
The indicators are rotating, the time passes, and then I say, this clock, it looks at me and I feel threatened.
We already feel very happy, and we start talking about the theater, I talk to them about the main object of the theater, which is the study of man.
This complicated machine that we keep writing down the user manual, and we don't know exactly how it works.
The limits, the functions, we do not yet know.
But in the theater, we can make that choice.
The conversation is heated, and we're already starting to talk about art, philosophy, painting, drama, and suddenly I forget that I'm in prison, and I think I'm somewhere, like here.
And then I wonder, these people here, who are in front of me, could well be scientists, painters, poets, and I cannot understand how they got in there.
And then I realize that the limits to being in prison are very thin: a financial debt, a dark feeling, a choice, a tricky one, and the limit is lost.
We immediately begin a powerful improvisation.
Inside the group is a sailor.
I tell him to tell us about his adventures at sea.
He starts talking about the Pacific, the Atlantic, and all of us in there, under the captaincy of this sailor, start creating the conditions of a ship as it sinks.
It was a pleasure!
I really felt, both they and I, that we had escaped.
We lost our minds and went to a remote place, to an incredible island.
I could tell you so much about all those moments I had with these people in general.
By June, when we will be performing in the prisons of Korydalu, I will have passed the prison entrance more than 80 times, and I will have worked with a total of more than 50 participants.
I could tell you too much.
There are many touching human moments that exist even in there.
For this meeting.
But I'm only going to stay in one.
When Prospero, at the beginning of the project, says to his daughter for the first time, "Now, my child, I will tell you who your father is, who is not a king, only in a poor cell, one of the participants approached me at the end of the rehearsal to tell me how touched he was by those words.
Tuel was reminded of the first time he met his son, on a visit to the prison, to tell him who he really was.
The rehearsal is over, the time is running out, I have to get out.
I greet the participants, they greet me too, we managed, we managed to escape our prison in a few hours.
I go out, get my ID, my cell phone, and take a big step out of prison.
No, I won't open my cell phone, I don't want to know who called me, if I have messages, or answer an email.
No, right now I want to enjoy it, I'm out, I'm out again, and I start looking up at the sky, listening to the birds, the trees, and the lyrics of the poet George Sarantharis are ringing: "I need to walk, with the trees to walk, In a world of joyful waters".
I would like to share this experience with the passersby who walk around me.
I look at them, I see them, and I see sad people, face down, but it's possible; I was in prison now and those I see, who think they have no limits, who think they are free, have the right to be sad; to be sad, to be imprisoned in their opinions, in their attitudes, in life; no!
I wonder, after all, whether freedom is an internal or an external matter.
If those inside may be prisoners, but they are truly free, let us here ask ourselves if we are truly free.
If freedom means the arrival of limits, then the man who has limits is free.
The one who seeks the limits.
Who each time sets new limits, to overcome them and then overcome them.
I get in the car.
I take the book out of my pocket, open it, and see a dedication inside: Voice: To our director who helped us escape with the art of the theater, and who personally helped me to recall who I am.
Thank you very much.
(el applause)
I will try not to fall into the temptation to talk about all that happened this morning.
Let me tell you a story, that is, the moment the Counter-Terrorism goes home...
Well, then, let it go.
Let's go to the established ones.
(Voices) Let's get started.
Well, this is my school.
It's this little shop right around the corner, under a working-class apartment building in Santa Barbara.
I want translators to be a little careful about this last one because there is often a confusion with Santa Barbara.
(Laughter) Let me tell you a story.
A few years ago I was invited to the college, only as a guest could I go, along with Dimitri Papaioannou, to the Olympic Games, to pick the best student, who gives nice speeches, etc., and at some point I get caught by the American college principal, a gentleman with tirades, a pavilion, a belly, a little red nose, very sympathetic, but American, and he says to me, "What school have you finished; I try to change the conversation", he says, "No, please, what school have you finished; I say: "Another school in Santa Barbara".
Oh, Santa Barbara college!, he tells me.
(Laughter) I left him wondering, making a joke anyway, not continuing the conversation.
Well, St. Barbara, you are.
This is the school, this is the nursery.
It was a basement, there was also a first floor, but lessons on the first floor were more expensive.
This is the sphere, it was in a much better view.
The bullets are in the air.
There was also the Gypsy Athletic Team of St. Barbara.
Unrelated information.
This is through the...el.
I'm not here anywhere.
Because I always had a problem.
I liked to participate in the screening, photographing, etc. more than playing.
I will tell you frankly that Santa Barbara was a very beautiful area, that is, I grew up very beautifully, there were, of course, various accidents.
There was, however, camping, there was an arena we played, there was the Kotalyanos, the older ones may remember him, who pushed the cars.
All of these are my own photographs.
I'm not even on the machines.
At fifteen we all got a bike.
I took a vespas, said my father was leaving me, etc., the usual lies you tell, anyway, I took the vespas, after a week, I returned it.
They tell me, "What happened?" and I say, "Ladies, there's a problem with this thing.
The Vespel, remember, the old one, had the speeds on the steering wheel, one, two, three, four, so on; I tell them, 'There's a problem with this Vespel.'
They tell me: What's going on; I say, Look, when I put first, I start too fast, but then I can't finish, and if I put fourth, I have a hard time starting, but then I run too fast.
I mean, I thought then that the manufacturer gave me a choice.
That is, one morning I start with first, one day I start with second, one with third, one with fourth.
I say this because that's how we learned things.
That is, we learned, we made mistakes, we moved on.
That's how we learned journalism almost.
Well, we're talking about the... oh, because we're talking about bishops and I want to take a break, because along with our mistakes, we've had the little lies, the little myths.
I'm going to go to the most painless today.
We've all heard that line that was first said by Vegos, "You know from vespá;".
So; well, from a very young age I had noticed in that black and white film that Vegos was either driving this or driving this.
You know the least about a machine, you know that this is not a vespá.
And because I know and more I tell you that it is a Zundap.
The Zundalp was a machine that came out in the '60s and '70s.
In '84, the German Zundel was bankrupt, and the Chinese bought it.
So; that is, since then, there has been a bankruptcy of both German and Chinese.
But in other roles.
Well... (Laughter) (Applause) We are talking, however, about going back to our history, to 1981, a very old time.
A very old time; I wonder at times.
Because I have the feeling that too many times, reality makes a loop.
That is, the same persons, the same events and only the subtitles change.
I don't know if you agree.
Be careful.
The Pasok, A' Athens, by Manolis Glezos.
Elections of 1981.
Manuel Glezos, of course, was an outlaw of power then, as he is today.
I also used a dúneltuk then, now with a microphone, a slight variation.
Well, we're talking about 1981, to withdraw that, that's wrong.
We're talking about 1981 and I want to move on to the main characters today, starting with my friend, the little one.
Let's go to the hotel.
Stavros Theodorakis: What are we going to talk about?
SLΘ: I said let's talk about girls.
Kel: But the school is ahead of the curve.
SLΘ: Okay, the school.
What class are you in; K: Tuesday.
SLΘ: Tuesday.
A good student I have learned, e; K: Mμμ.. ΣΘ: My favorite lesson; Κ: Mathematics.
ΣelΘ: Mathematics is not difficult; K: If you know how to teach, it is not at all difficult.
ΣelΘ: You know good training, right; Quick; Κ: Yes.
SL: Tell me, let's say the eighth.
Which makes it even harder for me to be eight.
Kel: A, we have not learned the eighth, we have learned the sixth, the fifth.
SLΘ: Tell me about the six.
K: One or six six, two or six twelve, three or six eighteen, four or six twenty-four, five or six thirty, six or six thirty-six, seven or six forty-two, six or eight forty-eight, nine or six fifty-four.
SLΘ: It's great.
All are pennies, so; K: Some pennies, some nines.
I've had nine and up.
In mathematics, ten is of course.
ΣelΘ: So you will become a mathematician; What you will become; Κ: Master of Mathematics.
SLΘ: A, a teacher of mathematics.
The younger children, however, listen to you; K: Yes.
ΣelΘ: Ε; What do you tell them; Κ: To keep quiet.
SLΘ: Let me ask you something difficult now.
Kel: Yes, I did.
If you could change something in your life... K: Mmmm... Sh: What would that be; K: I wish the environment were cleaner and I could see my whole family, my father, my mom and my brother more often.
SLΘ: So this is my friend Kyriakos.
There is a view that the worst family is better, it is better than the best institution.
I personally disagree with this view.
Kyriakos lives in the Hague, has been abandoned by his parents in the Hague of the Perizhos, and since then, has been living with children who have been taken there by prosecutors or their parents.
Kyriakos has a lot of dreams, as you can see, like the other children of the Stage.
That is, continually, what they say is not what they have been through, but what they will achieve or what they are achieving at the moment.
It's the Cheylon.
SELΘ: Back in Thessaloniki, you faced problems; you're a Muslim woman, a peasant woman.
Ceylon: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Thank God, no.
Okay, racist, there is no such thing, so my whole department talks, discusses, does, and shows and they know me.
SLΘ: What do you tell them; T: I tell them what is happening in the village.
And they like it.
SL: How can you justify not knowing the language well; or at least not knowing it... T: I don't know it well.
ΣelΘ:...with an accent.
You know her very well...
Thank you, El.
SLΘ: You speak very well.
Τel: Thank you.
SHEL: How do you justify this foreign accent, though; T: I tell them that I am a Muslim, that my parents do not speak Greek, that I can read Arabic, I speak Pomakian, I know Turkish very well, and that is why I am not so good at the accent and they understand me.
(Music) Cheelan: But I like the village.
I do what I want to do.
Whatever crazy thing comes to me.
I get up, I get down, I get down to Thessaloniki, I can pick them up, we can gather in the house, we can do whatever crazy we want, we can watch a movie, we can go out.
There is no problem, no restriction.
Okay, Joel, you may be a girl who knows what you're doing, doesn't do what's forbidden, but you can do whatever you want.
As long as you know what you're doing.
So I like being in the village.
I'm having fun.
ΣELΘ: Well, Ceylon is from the Bulgarian almost border, the Pomakokori.
A region so close, but also so far away.
Until '96, as you know, to go to these villages you had to get special permission from the army.
Now, it's a big deal, because we were afraid of these people.
What's important is that Ceylon has found a very simple trick.
When he gets on the bus to Thessaloniki, he takes off his cloak and colorful clothes, and wears some other more sporty clothes.
He is studying Economics in Thessaloniki and aspires to open the first accounting office of a local firm in those villages within two years.
Let's go and see Katerina.
SLΘ: One dose in the morning; Katerina: Yes.
But every day.
I'm given a drink, I drink it and then I'm gone.
SLΘ: You are not trusted to give it to the house; K: I don't think that's it.
It's a very strict program.
The specific rules are among the strictest in Greece.
It has happened and they missed the administration for a minute.
And there's no waiting there for a minute or a half.
You don't get a prescription, you're sick all day.
And it has more deprived substances than heroin, or methadone.
SHELΘ: You're slowly taking down the methadone now; K: I expect, basically, that a lot of things will go well in my life before I start taking down.
I mean, if I'm back with the Holy One and see these things, I don't know if I'll be so strong and patient in the end.
ΣΘ: Relations; Παναγιώτης: Relations; ΣΘ: Have; Can; Π: Μπα.
My mind is somewhere else.
Sh: What; Katerina: Hey, we've been sleeping together like two friends... Sh: What; You can't; K:...a long time.
PEL: He's somewhere else.
It's a little elaborate, but it's somewhere else, kid, okay.
Self-defeating, not for the sake of masculinity, and well, humiliating in general.
ST: Katrina had been on drugs for eight years, on heroin, at some point decided to do it herself, entered a substitute program.
Τα 'el has succeeded.
Of course, in a country where heroin is much easier to find on the road than substitutes or medication to stop the drug.
Katrina's big bet is whether she will go back to her boyfriend's universe or whether her boyfriend will go back to her own universe.
Let's go see Marina.
I will never forget that moment when the loudspeakers shouted: "Litvinova, release".
Which, say, came out, the whole wing saying goodbye to me.
From the emotion and tears, I could not see, I could not distinguish faces, only when they hugged me and put the wish in my ear, I tried to understand who they were.
I am so blessed to have made so many wishes that day.
I think so far they have been accompanying me and giving me strength.
SLΘ: Prison is never a nightmare; M: Very often.
Even in the smallest of things, I often think of prison.
When I leave home and lock the door and play with the keys in my hand and go to work or university, I flood with joy.
And I thank God.
Where I have keys, where I have a house, where I have a job.
It's like a dream that I'm living.
SLΘ: Marina spent about three years in prison.
At first, he was too afraid of his peers.
Then, at some point, he thought of making a diaper for the child of an equestrian who had a birthday.
Since then, he has been approaching them.
She would line them up, at some point, she tells me, that I would line them up and make pencils and take away the maps.
That's how the prison works, somehow; you wash my clothes and I give you a pack of cigarettes.
The alternative economy.
The point is that Marina was released from prison, entered Law School, and is one of the few cases where she received a large amount of compensation from the Greek state for being in prison unjustly.
For every day he spent in prison, about three and a half years, he received 25 euros from the Greek state.
And the last one is Demetrius.
SL: So in the morning you feel a little taller than the others who are bent down the streets, eh; Dimitris: Because you are free.
And you're not stuck in the details.
You see them a little like God, from above, from far away, from a distance.
People are like looking for problems.
(Music) ΣΘ: More footnotes; Δ: Now, we're planning with the kids for Cuba, he just wants me to get my therapy done before so I can be ready to endure there.
ΣelΘ: The temptation to endure; Δ: No, more so the heat.
Because we are hard at work in the heat.
But, it's worth the effort.
SELΘ: I met Dimitris, on days like this, last year.
Demetrius suffers from a very rare disease, cystic fibrosis, which is the most lethal inherited disease of the white race.
When Abel was born, life expectancy was ten years.
He turned 20, turned 30, and now doctors think he'll be 40.
When Demetrius learned that the boundaries were too small to abandon the weapons, he entered the field of architecture, founded a club that changed the Schismanoglio, that is, many children of the cystic pulse dynamically changed the treatment conditions in Schismanoglio and continues and, of course, I believe will defeat all statistics.
So, Dimitris, who fights and conquers death, Marina, who goes against the mistakes of the state, the children who try to correct their own mistakes, Ceylon, who goes against the conservative environment of her country and her community, and my friend who tries to overcome social exclusion.
That's what I wanted to tell you tonight.
I wanted to tell you, that there is also the old road.
That man possesses a drive that can make him overcome confinement, immobility, and perhaps even death.
The thirst for what we don't have can lead you to the river and lead you across.
(Applause) In the past, socialization was a family affair.
Absolutely exclusive.
Then, the school was added.
Then, the media was added.
Now, social media is slowly being added.
A little parody.
I wonder too many times if I grew up in an environment where everything was ahead of me.
If, that is, you discover pages by pressing the button on a keyboard.
Where would my curiosity stop; if I had enough of this discovery and not moved on to the next discovery; anyway, that's another matter.
What I want to say, in closing, is that television, as the most powerful medium, must, among other things, give way to this impulse.
In other words, he must teach people to listen to their impulse.
That's what I think I do with the main characters, or rather, to be precise, that's what I do with my main characters, believing that momentum can successfully counteract immobile fate.
Thank you, El.
(el applause)
