The steel needle also floats on the water due to the water's surface pressure.
The water molecules on the water's surface are more strongly attracted to each other than the air molecules above their upper air, which is due to the surface pressure.
Water molecules produce an invisible surface on the surface of the water that causes essentials such as needles to float on the water.
The blade of modern ice skate has two edges in their appearance, where the concave perforated. These two edges help to draw ice better even when tilting.
The bottom of the blade is slightly curved, and since it leans to any one side, the ice that comes in contact with that edge also curves.
This makes the skater turn around. If the skates lean to the right, the skater turns to the right, if it turns to the left, the skater turns to the left.
They have to lose a lot of energy from light to reach their first energy level.
"They do it by emitting a particle of the little light called ""photon""."
Scientists call this process "induced emission of radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which leads to the emission of photons and is a type of radiation of light.
The next image shows the atoms emit the potans. that is, in fact, the potans are much smaller than they appear in the image. 
Photons are smaller than the material that makes up atoms.

The problem is decreasing as lens manufacturers have achieved high quality in lens production.
This allows zoom lenses to create quality images compared to fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is that the maximum perforation (speed) of the lens is of course small.
This makes it difficult for cheap zoom lenses to be used in low-light conditions without flash.
