In 2011, both chambers have already adopted the proposed amendment.
The amendment was made at this legislative session — first the House of Representatives removed the second sentence, and then the Senate on Monday adopted it in a similar way.
The removal of a second sentence, which provided for the ban on civil unions between same-sex persons, creates prerequisites for the possible registration of such unions in the future.
After the completion of this process, the following elected legislature will again reconsider the joint resolution-3 in 2015 or 2016 so that the consideration can last.

Two decades later, China's GDP could exceed the United States' GDP.
The fourth in the season of the Atlantic hurricanes of 2010 tropical storm "Daniel" appeared in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum wind force at a storm, which is about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, is 40 miles/h (64 km/h).
According to the forecast of scientists of the National Center for Hurricanes, Daniel will go to the category of hurricane to Wednesday.
It is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the storm on the United States and the Caribbean, as it is far from the ground.

Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I had to watch the terrible scene — people to get out of the window, broke windows.
People tried to break the windows with the help of chairs, but these windows were not white.
According to the victim, Francišak Koval, "one of the windows finally could not stand it, and people began to get out through the window."
Stars emit heat and light due to the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or merge), resulting in more severe elements.
At the moment, scientists are working on the development of a reactor, which would be able to produce energy in a similar way.
But this is a very difficult task, and it will take many more years before suitable for operation of the thermonuclear synthesis reactors will be built.
Due to the surface tension, the steel needle can float on the surface of the water.
The surface tension occurs, since the water molecules on its surface are strongly attracted to each other, and the strength of the attraction between them is greater compared to the attraction of air molecules from above.
Water molecules form on its surface invisible skin, so that such things as, for example, a needle, can stay afloat.
On modern skating, the blade has a double sharpness with a concave cavity between the edges. This provides the best contact with ice, even if the skates are at an angle.
The lower part of the blade is slightly curved, so when the blade is bent down, its edge also bents, which touches the ice.
This is due to the fact that the figure performs a turn. When sloping skates to the right, the figure skater turns to the right. Accordingly, when sloping skates to the left, he turns to the left.
To return the previous level of energy, they need to get rid of excess energy derived from the light.
To do this, they produce a tiny particle of light, which is called "photon".
The scientific name of this process is "induced radiation issue", since bright light stimulates atoms, the emission of the photon of light occurs, and light is one of the types of radiation.
On the image below you can see the atoms that emit the photons. In fact, of course, the photons are much smaller than the image.
The size of the photons is even smaller than that of the particles that make up the atoms!
The thread of the light bulb burns after hundreds of hours of work and the light bulb ceases to shine.
In this case, the light bulb must be changed. You need to be careful when replacing it.
First of all, you need to turn off the lighting switch or turn off the cable.
The electricity that goes into the cart where the metal part of the light bulb is located can cause severe electric shock if you, while the light bulb is in the chuck, touch the inside of the cartridge or metal base of the light bulb.
The heart pumps blood and is the main organ of the circulatory system.
In the direction from the heart, blood moves through the vessels known as arteries, and in the direction of the heart — in the blood vessels known as veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
Even very tough branches and roots (and not just leaves) did not pose any problems for tritzerataps teeth.
According to some scientists, tricerathops could consume sludges — a type of plant that were very common in the chalk period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of sprench of sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the tritzerataps could tear off the leaves with the help of his mighty beak.
At the same time, other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs eat them. And this despite the fact that in our time, poisonous leaves or fruit can feed lazy and other animals, for example, a parrot (and it comes from dinosaurs).
How do I have to do the gravity of Io? Your weight on the surface of Io would be less than on Earth.
A man of 200 pounds (or 90 kg) weighing on Earth on Io will weigh about 36 pounds (or 16 kg). Therefore, it is clear that gravity on Io affects things to a lesser extent.
Unlike Earth, the Sun has no solid surface on which one could stand. The sun is made entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
The gas is becoming increasingly rarefied as it moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part of the Sun we see is the photo sphere or in the translation of the "ball of light".
In 1610, almost three thousand years later, observations of the telescope for Venus allowed the Italian astronomer Galileo to see that it also has phases.
Only the side of Venus (or the Moon) that is turned to the Sun is the reason for the change of phases. The Phases of Venus served as evidence of Copernicus' theory, which claimed that the planets were spinning around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, the astronomer of England, Jerema Horax, supervised the passage of Venus on the disk of the Sun.
After Daniel's won, peace was established in England for a long time.
However, in 991, Ethelredo opposed the Viking fleet. Only the Gutrum fleet could be compared with the last one hundred years ago.
It was a fleet under the command of the Norwegian Olaf Trigwasson, who wanted to free his homeland from Danish domination.
Ethelredo managed to negotiate with Olaf after the initial military setbacks, after which he returned to Norway to win his kingdom. In this case, he was accompanied by a change of success.
Hangil is the only alphabet in the world that has been developed specifically, and which is used by many people daily. He appeared in 1444, when King Sedjan (1418–1450) was the ruler of the country.
Sedjon, one of the most respected persons of royal blood, was the fourth van of the Dynasty of the Chosone.
He first gave the alphabet to Hangul's name "Hunmin Jonheim". This in translation means "proper sounds to be instructed by people".
There are many theories that explain how and where Sanskrit came from. One of them claims that it was the native language of the Ariyev, who moved to India from the west.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The book was written in Sanskrit. After the Upanids were compiled, Sanskrit simply disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a rich and very complex language based on which a number of modern dialects of India have appeared, similar to how European languages, such as Spanish and French, have developed from Latin.
After the battle for France ended, Germany began preparations for the capture of Britain.
Germany marked the attack with the code name "Operation Sea Cat". Most of the heavy weapons and stocks of the British army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkerk, which weakened the army enough.
But still the power of the Royal Navy was much more than in the German Navy (which is called "Krygsmarine" in German): he could have destroyed any attacking fleet heading through the English Channel.
At the same time, near the likely routes of invasion, very few ships of the Royal Navy were based, because the Admirals feared their flooding by German air forces.
Let's first explain the plans of Italy. This country was the "junior brother" of Japan and Germany.
Despite the fact that before the beginning of the war was built four new ships, its army and navy were weaker.
African countries were the main goal of Italy. They needed a launching pad for the capture of these countries, from which troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.
To this end, they had to get rid of the British bases and ships that were in Egypt. Nothing but this Italian linear ships had to do.
Now for Japan. Just like the United Kingdom, Japan was an island nation.
Submarines are ships that have been specially designed to move under water. They can be under water for a long time.
Submarines were used both during the First and Second World Wars. They moved very slowly at that time, and the firing range was very insignificant.
When the war had just begun, they were swimming mainly on the surface of the sea. However, due to the fact that the radars were improved and became more precise, the submarines had to fall under the water so that they could not be noticed.
German submarines were called "B-but". The Germans had excellent skills in navigating and driving submarines.
After the war, Germany was not allowed to have many submarines because of their successful use.
Yes! One of the most famous in our time of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs is Pharaoh Tutanhahamon, it is sometimes called "phanayaon Here" or "pharaon-boy".
Interestingly, the ancient lists of kings did not make it, because they were considered not very important.
At the same time, after 1922. The place of his burial was found, he became famous. When many graves were robbed in the past, his grave remained almost untouched.
The most of the items that were buried with Tutankhamun were well preserved. Among them, thousands of artifacts from rare stones and precious metals can be mentioned.
Thanks to the invention of the wheels with spokes, Assyrian chariots became lighter, fast and were able to overtake both soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows without problems broke the armor of soldiers of the enemy army. The cavalry first appeared in the Assyrians in about 1000 BC.
Cavalry is a kind of troops fighting riding horses. Assyrian cavalry fought, sitting right on the backs of her horses, because at that time the saddle had not yet been invented.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps Homer, the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature — "Iliad" and "Odyssea" — is the most famous representative of this culture.
Even in our time, popular playwrights remain Sophocles and Aristophans, and their plays are included in the treasury of world literature.
The mathematician Pythagoras also belongs to the number of famous immigrants from Greece. It was famous mainly for the legendary theorem about the ratio of the aspects of a rectangular triangle.
There are different opinions about how many people speak in Hindi. According to various estimates, this language is one of the first places in the world (betwen the second and fourth) in the number of people who speak it.
There are different estimates of the number of speakers of this language, depending on whether the related dialects are taken into account.
The total number of speakers of this language in the world is estimated at 340 to 500 million, and about 800 million more people can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu are similar to a vocal box, but different writing; speakers of both languages in everyday conversations usually understand each other.
Somewhere in the 15-th century, Germany had a significant impact on the culture of northern Estonia.
German monks intended to bring the indigenous people closer to God, so it was thanks to them that the Estonian literary language arose.
It was based on the German alphabet, to which the letter «Õ/õ was added".
Many of the German-speaking words have merged into one. Thus began the era of enlightenment.
The heir to the throne would have traditionally gone to the army after graduation.
However, at Trinity College, Cambridge Charles went to pursue higher education. There he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then also history, and received 2:2 (the lower second class degree).
Charles became the first member of the royal family of Great Britain to be awarded a scientific degree.
3% of the country's territory falls on the European part of Turkey (this is Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey's length is more than 1600 km (or 1000 miles) and the width is about 800 km (or 500 miles). The territory of the country resembles a rectangle.
783 562 square kilometers (or 300 948 square miles) — this area is occupied by Turkey (taking into account lakes). Southwest Asia accounts for 755 688 square kilometers (or 291 773 square miles) from the mentioned amount, and in Europe — 23 764 square kilometers (or 9 174 square kilometers).
Turkey ranks 37th in the world by the largest — its area is almost metropolis of France and the United Kingdom together.
On the three sides, Turkey is washed by seas: in the west — Aegean, in the north — Black and in the south — Mediterranean.
Luxembourg gained independence only in 1839, despite its long history.
Modern regions of Belgium previously belonged to Luxembourg, but passed to Belgium after the Belgian revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg has always sought to maintain neutrality, but during the First and Second World Wars it was under German occupation.
Luxembourg in 1957. became one of the original members of the founding members of the association, which nowadays everyone knows under the name "European Union".
The Dzong is a Buddh monastery and ruins of the fortress located in the upper part of the Parro district (or rather, in the village of Fundi).
It is believed that the Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgiel in 1649 built a fortress to immortalize his own victory over the Tibetan-Mongol army.
As a result of the fire in 1951. There were only a few relics from Drukgiel-Dzongo, including the image of Shabdrunga Ngavanga Namgial.
After the fire, the fortress was conserved and taken under guard. Even today, it is still among the most wonderful sights of Bhutan.
Cambodia for the 18 century was sandwiched between Thailand and Vietnam — two powerful neighbors.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was attacked several times by the Thais who completely destroyed Phnompen in 1772.
On the slope of the 18 century in Cambodia also invaded the Vietnamese.
Eighteen percent of Venezuela's residents do not have a job, and those who have mainly work in the shadow sector of the economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
Despite the fact that only one percent of Venezuelans works in the oil industry, the oil industry is important for the country, as the latter is a net oil exporter.
When the country has just gained independence, the experience and professionalism of the staff of the Botanical garden of Singapore helped turn the island into a tropical city-garden.
In 1981, the Vanda Mis Jaaakim hybrid orchid was chosen by the country's national flower.
To find rains when October is approaching, about 1.5 million herbiates leave the northern hills every year and head to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River.
After the April rains, they return to the north again through the western part of the savannah and again cross the Mara River.
Serengeti National Park, Masva Reserve in Tanzania, Ngorongara Reserve and Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya are located in the Serengeti region.
To learn how to create an interactive environment, you need to have both appropriate traditional skills and those that have been acquired in interactive classes (including the creation of storytellers, installation and editing of audio materials and video materials, writing stories, etc.)
Interactive modeling requires you to rethink your submissions about the preparation of materials for the media and learn to unlinear thinking.
For the purposes of interactive design, it is necessary that the components of the project are not only combined, but also make sense separately.
The lens with varying focal length have a specific disadvantage — they have a strong complexity and the number of lens elements that are needed to reach a certain range of focal lengths.
The problem disappears, because manufacturers of lenses are reaching more and more high standards in their manufacture.
Thanks to this, the quality of photos that could be done with the help of such zoom lenses could be compared with the quality of photos that were made with a lens with a fixed focal length.
As a rule, a smaller maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is another disadvantage of zoom lenses.
For this reason, inexpensive zoom lenses are difficult to use without a flash, if there is little light.
The strip on the screen is one of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format.
The design of the bulk of TVs is designed in such a way that it pleases as many people as possible.
Therefore, the TV picture always cut boundaries — from above, bottom and sides.
This is done to make the image guaranteed to cover the screen completely. The phenomenon was called the "lane".
Sad, but if you're making a DVD, the boundaries of the image are likely to also be cut off. Therefore, subtitles can only be seen in part if they are too close to the bottom of the screen.
Classic medieval castles have long given space for imagination — they gave birth to images of knightly fights, banquets and forced to remember the legends of King Arthur.
The sounds and smells of ancient battles are easily mentioned, the knocking of hooves on the pavement is almost heard, and there is fear that rises from the underground prisons, even if you are just standing between the millennial ruins.
But how much is our perception of reality? Why did they build castles at all? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxlo Castle, a typical period for this period, is a more fortified house than a real castle.
It is unlikely that massive glass windows and thin walls of the lock could hold the decisive attack of the enemy for a long time.
When Lord Hastings began to build it in the 1480's, the situation in the country was quite peaceful, and it was necessary to defend only from the small groups of wandering looters.
The balance forces began to be used as a tool, with the help of which European countries tried to ensure the national sovereignty of all peoples of Europe.
The point of the concept was that all European countries sought to prevent the strengthening of any one state. As a result, in order to maintain balance, national governments often joined various alliances.
The first war, the main problem of which was the ratio of forces, was just the War for the Spanish Succession.
This was an important change, since more European states had no reason to start religious wars. Finally, the last religious war was the Thirty Years' War.
As a result of the arson committed by Herostratus, July 21, 356. Before our era, the temple of Artemis was destroyed in Ephesus.
If you believe the legends, his goal was to be aware of any cost. The Ephesians indignantly announced that the name of Herastrat would never be listed in the annals.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned his name — that is why we know it today. On the same night, when Alexander the Great was born, the temple of Artemis was destroyed.
Alexander the Great made a truly royal gesture, proposing to pay for the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was not accepted. The temple was restored in the 323 century BC, after the death of Alexander.
Your hand should be as relaxed as possible. Make sure you still press the key correctly. In addition, try to avoid unnecessary and unnecessary movements with your fingers.
So you're getting less tired. It should be remembered that there is no need to press the keys very much to get a stronger sound, as they do on the piano.
To get an additional amount of air playing on the accordion, it is necessary to exert more pressure and speed to affect the bags.
Mysticism is the desire to connect with the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God, to identify with or to know them.
The purpose of believers is to obtain practical experience, develop a spiritual vision or understanding of the essence of the divine reality or the essence of the deity.
Followers lead a certain lifestyle or are engaged in appropriate practices in order to enrich their own experience of this kind.
The difference of mysticism from other religious beliefs and cults is that in mysticism, the focus is on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, in particular, if this experience is peaceful, discerning, blessed or even ecstatic.
Sichism is a religion that comes from the Indian subcontinent. It appeared in the 15 century in the Punjab region as a result of the emergence of various sectarian groups in Hinduism.
Despite the recognition of the Hindu roots and the traditions of Sikhism by the Shikhs, they still believe that their faith and Hinduism are separate religions.
The Sikhi calls their religion Gurmat, which in the language of Punjabi means "the path of the guru". In all Indian religions, the concept of guru is central and is of great importance, but in Sichism it has become so important that it is the main component of the beliefs of the Sikhs. 
The founder of religion in the 15th century was the nank (1469–1539). After that, there were nine more gurus in a row.
However, in June 1956, when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wages, turned out to be a common protest against communism, Khrushchev's promises were tested.
And although in the end Khrushchev restored order in the country with the help of tanks, nevertheless he made some economic concessions and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gamulk to the post of a new prime minister.
Indian civilization is a Bronze Age civilization. The habitat of this civilization was located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. The above-mentioned area was a significant part of the territory of modern Pakistan, as well as some regions in the northeast of Afghanistan and northwestern India.
This civilization has reached its heyday in the Indus River Basin. That's where the name comes from.
Given that this civilization also existed in the basins of the dried river Saraswati, some scientists suggest that it should be properly called the Indo-Saraswat civilization. At the same time, some call it the Harap civilization in honor of the city of Harap, the first excavations of which began in the 1920-ies.
The achievements in the field of medicine were largely contributed to the fact that the Roman Empire was a militaristic state.
Emperor Augustus was the first to hire doctors to serve. He even created the first Roman medical corps to provide medical care to those who suffer in future battles.
Surgeons are known all sorts of analges, including morphine, which is obtained from poppy seeds extract, and scopolamine from the extract of blocace seeds.
To save patients with gangrene, they have learned to make amputations, and in order to stop bleeding — to impose harnesses and arterial compressions.
In the field of medicine, the Roman Empire has made great success for several centuries, and a significant part of the knowledge we have today, we owe it to her.
A simple origami is a style of origami, in which you can do only one fold in one technique. More complex folds, such as the reverse fold, are not allowed. At the same time, they are all characterized by simple arrangement.
This technique was developed in the 1970's by John Smith, who sought to facilitate classes for inexperienced or limited motor skills.
Children at a very young age develop awareness of races and there are racial stereotypes that form the type of behavior.
Children, for example, identifying themselves with such a racial minority, whose representatives, according to the stereotype, do not study well in school, as soon as they learn about this racial stereotype, as a rule, start to go poorly at school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, currently registering 54 million profiles.
These websites have gained great popularity, mainly in the educational environment.
These websites have a number of positive features, among which it is possible to easily set up a class page with blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
You can go to this page by entering only one web address. Thus, students who find it difficult to use the keyboard, or who have problems with spelling, can quickly remember and type it.
It can be arranged in such a way that it is easy to read. In addition, you can choose a color scheme for it.
The attention deficit syndrome is "neurological syndrome, the three classical manifestations of which are pathological distraction, impulsivity, as well as excessive amount of energy (or hyperactivity)".
This is a cognitive disability, not an inability to learn; it "meets in 3–5 percent of children, it is about 2 million children of all children."
Children with attention deficit syndrome, it is difficult to focus, for example, on school assignments, but they are able to concentrate on the things they like. It can be your favorite cartoons, games or writing saids without punctuation.
Given that the brain of these children cannot be stimulated by conventional methods, they "participate in risky behavior, engage in fights and challenge the authorities", which leads to a large number of problems.
The focus shortness syndrome affects the relationship with peers because other children cannot understand why those who suffer from the SU, act and write accordingly, or why they have a different level of maturity.
The basic speed of gaining knowledge has changed as a result of the above-mentioned change in the ability to gain knowledge and learn.
Another approach is to get information. Within the framework of individual tests for memorization, there was no more coercion, but more attention began to be paid to the ability to remember the text.
In fact, the approach to learning and expansion of knowledge has changed significantly in the Renaissance.
Hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry weight and swaying on trees — unlike other primates.
In size and length, the arm and foot chimpanzee are similar. This indicates that when walking with a support on the fingers to carry the weight, hands were used.
The man's hand is not as long as the foot, and the phalanges on it are more direct.
The mentioned transition in the work of hand from moving objects to operations is evidenced by the fossil bones of the hands from two to three million years.
According to some people, many artificially caused conscious dreams can often be exhausted.
This phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that with conscious dreams, the period between the phases of rapid sleep increases.
If during the night you have less phases of reM sleep, the state in which you really sleep, and your body is restored, becomes not frequent enough, and this is a problem.
It's just as tired than waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch something on TV.
The effect affects the frequency with which your brain tries to see conscious dreams during the night.
Almost from the very beginning the case of the Italians in North Africa did not give up. After the declaration of war by Italy on June 10, 1940, during the week, the British 11th Hussar Regiment captured the Libyan Fort Kapuza.
The British organized an ambush in the direction east of the Bardy and captured General Lastucci, who was the chief of engineering troops of the tenth army of Italy.
Governor-General of Libya and the obvious successor of Mussolini, Marshal Itala BÂbo was killed during the landing in Tobruk under fire, which led his troops. It happened on June 28.
Modern fencing is carried out on many levels. They are engaged in university students and professional athletes. It is part of the Olympic program.
In this sport, it is mostly like a duel: one fencer competes with another.
Golf is a game in which players score goals in the holes, using special sticks for this.
During the typical game, players go through eighteen holes. The game usually starts with the first and ends on the eighteenth hund on the field.
The victory will get the golfer, who will need to do the least blows or encroachments stick to pass the whole field.
The game takes place on a field with a grassy coating. Around the hole grass mowed shorter, and this place itself is called "grin".
The most popular type of tourism is probably tourism for leisure: something that the vast majority of people associate with travel.
It is at this point that people go to rest and have fun in a place that has nothing to do with their daily life.
Most often, tourists who want to relax a little and relax, visit such standard places as beaches, arrestments and camps.
If a person, visiting a specific place, sets a goal to study its history and culture, then this is cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various sights and sights of one particular country or pay special attention to only one region or region.
Watching everything that is happening, the colonists also called reinforcements.
The 1st and 3-th regiment of the state of New Hampshire were part of the troops, which ensured the strengthening of advanced positions. Each room had 200 people. They were commanded by colonels John Stark and James Reed, who later became generals.
The people of Stark settled from the north edge of the positions of the colonists along the fence.
After the tide opened access to the gap along the Mystical River on the north-east coast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence, building a short stone wall that stretched out and ended on a small beach near the edge of the water.
At a distance of about 100 feet (30 meters) from the Fence of Gridley or Stark put the sixth and ordered that no one would shoot until regular troops pass it.
Simultaneous coordinated attacks from three different sides were part of the American plan.
To prevent the transfer of reinforcements, General John Cadwalder went on the offensive to the British garrison in Bordentown.
Crossing the river to Trenton-Ferry 700 militias, General James Yuing captured the bridge over Asunpink-Cryk and did not allow enemy troops to escape.
The main strike group, which included 2400 people, was supposed to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then divide into two groups under the command of Sulivan and Green and attack the enemy before dawn.
When switching from a distance of a quarter of a mile to half a mile, the speed loses its importance, but the absolute need becomes strength.
Of course, a first-class runner for half a mile must not only have enough speed to run a distance in less than two minutes, but also maintain endurance and strength at any risk.
The best preparation for the new running season in winter is a cross-country cross-country cross-country along with exercises for the upper body in the gym.
One thing is just a proper diet does not guarantee high results, but can significantly improve the health of young athletes as a whole.
Improve your performance, get more pleasure from sports athletes will help maintain a good energy balance, effective fluid level replenishment habits and understanding various aspects of receiving dietary supplements.
The race for average distances is a relatively inexpensive sport. Nevertheless, there are many misconceptions about sports equipment that you need to have to participate in competitions.
Things can be purchased if they have a need, but they will not have a major effect on the result or this impact will be almost invisible.
Athletes can prefer any product, even if he does not have a real advantage.
It can be assumed that the atom is one of the fundamental building bricks, of which all matter is composed.
An atom is a rather complex object. According to the simplified Borov model, in its center there is a nucleus, in the orbits around which electrons move. The latter resembles planets that revolve around the sun (cf. Figure 1.1.)
The two particles form the nucleus — protons and neutrons.
While the neutrons have no charge, the protons have a positive electric charge. The electric charge of electrons is negative.
First you need to carefully study the scene of the incident to make sure of your own safety, and only then inspect the victim.
When approaching the victim, you need to pay attention to its position and the presence of suspicious signals.
If you get hurt when help, it can only make it difficult.
According to the study, it was determined that fear, depression and catastrophism were the link between the pain and the disability of patients who suffered from pain in the lower back.
Not depression and fear, but only catastrophism and its consequences led to regular weekly structured sessions on software.
People who were engaged in exercise on a regular basis, required greater support in the fact that concerned the negative perception of pain, in order to learn to distinguish the chronic pain from the discomfort caused by the exercises.
On vision or the ability to see the influence of the sensory organs of the visual system, or, in other words, eyes.
There are a large number of different eye structures, which differ in their complexity, due to the requirements of the body.
Different designs are characterized by different possibilities, different degree of acuity and sensitivity to different wavelengths. In addition, for the analysis of the input data, they have different processing methods and different parameters to ensure optimal functioning.
The population is a set of individuals of a particular species that exists inside a single geographical region.
When all members of the population have the same phenotypical characteristics, they are called monomorphic.
Members of the population are polymorphic in the event that they have different variants of some specific feature.
In the same way, the journey and nesting of colonies of nomadic ants occur in different phases.
During the nomad, wandering ants move at night, and during the day they stop on vacation.
The nomadic phase in the colony begins when the stocks of affordable food are decreasing. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests and changes them every day.
Each of these nomals or marches lasts about 17 days.
What's the cell? The word itself originates from the Latin "cella", which means "little room". It was first introduced into use by a microscopscribe that he studied the structure of the wood bark.
A cell is the main element of all living things, and they are all made up of one cell or more of them.
To study life, cells are basic and so important that they are often called the "building material of life".
By sending nerve impulses throughout the body, the nervous system provides unhindered blood circulation and thereby supports homeostasis.
Nerve impulses help the body to protect themselves from any possible threat due to the fact that very quickly transmitted over the body.
Compared with other strong storms, the tornado rages in a small area, but they are able to destroy literally everything in their way.
Tornado pulls out trees with roots, pulls out of the buildings signs and billboards and raises the cars into the sky. Two percent of the most destructive tornado is able to riot for more than three hours.
The wind speed in these terrible storms reaches 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
Graving lenses have been produced and used by people for thousands of years.
Hiking full-fledged telescopes, however, appeared in Europe only under the veil of the 16-th century.
In such telescopes, two lenses were used to bring closer, zoom and see distant objects.
Humanity will always be greedy and selfish, and the nature of cooperation is that if most benefit from something, then in the short term it is always possible to get more benefits if you act exclusively in their own interests.
We can only hope — for the most part people will realize that cooperation is the best option in the long term.
Many dream that the day will come when people will be able to go on a journey to other stars and study the second worlds. Some wonder what is there, some believe in aliens or life on other planets.
However, if this really happens someday, then probably not very soon. The stars are at such a great distance from each other that even between the "neighbors" are trillions of miles.
Perhaps your great-grandswons will one day think about their ancient ancestors, standing somewhere on top of the alien world?
Animal organs are a set of trillions of cells. They feed on various things that are digested in them inside. The vast majority of animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (although not everyone; for example, jellyfish do not have it).
Animals can be found anywhere in the world. They dig walk in the ground, swim in the water and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest functional and structural unit of any living organism.
The word "cell" (cell) was derived from the Latin cella, g. ie, "little room".
You will see that living things are composed of small squares or balls, if you try to see them under a microscope.
Using a microscope, Robert Sound, an English biologist, saw small squares in the bark.
They looked like a room. Hook was the first person to be able to see dead cells.
Connections and elements are able to move from one state to another without alterion.
Both nitrogen and liquid nitrogen have the same properties. The liquid is more dense, but these are the same molecules.
Another example is water. The composition of the water as a chemical compound includes two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Even when switching to a gaseous, liquid or solid state, it retains the same molecular structure.
Its chemical condition remains unchanged, even with a change in the physical condition.
Time is always around us and affects all of our actions. Despite this, it is difficult to understand.
Figures of religion, philosophy and science studied time for thousands of years.
According to our feelings, time is a series of events that, through the present, are moving into the past from the future.
In addition, time is something that we compare the duration of events.
Watching the repetition of the cyclical event, you can independently mark the course of time. A cyclical event is an event that regularly occurs again and again.
Nowadays, computers can be used to process photos and videos.
Complex animation, which is increasingly used in television and cinema, is created with the help of computers.
Complex computers are often used when recording music to handle and mix sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the idea prevailed that the Maori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand. They hunted large birds, known as moa.
Later, a theory was born, which claimed that the people of the Maori had sailed from Polynesia on the Great Flotilla, displaced the people of the Mariors from New Zealand and created an agricultural society on this land.
However, if you believe the new data, Mariori was a group of Maori from the "great land" that sailed to the islands of Chatham from New Zealand. They have developed their own unique peace culture.
Another tribe inhabited the islands of Chatham. These were the Maori from New Zealand who moved here.
"Mariori" — so they called themselves, there were several collisions, but at the end of the Mariori were destroyed.
People who have been involved in this work for several decades have helped us to better understand our own preferences and inclinations and at the same time sincerely appreciate the difficult moments and even failures.
Listening to the stories of people about themselves, their families and organizations in which they work, we received valuable information about the past and about some people, thanks to which the culture of the organization has undergone changes both in a good and bad way.
Understanding of culture does not necessarily go side by side with the understanding of history, but it helps people understand what place in the history of the organization they occupy.
In the process of assessing the successes and analysis of failures, the participants, both individually and together, will get to know the values of the organization more deeply, its mission and driving forces.
In this case, people were open to changes and new areas of activity of the local church, because they remembered the previous business behavior and the final successes.
These success stories have contributed to the reduction of fear of change and created positive prerequisites for future changes.
General thinking is methods of solving problems and problems in which the search for a solution is carried out in various fields and using different ideas.
This type of thinking is characterized by speed, consistency, accuracy, fact recognition, re-use of existing methods and data collection.
The most important feature of this type of thinking is that the correct answer can only be one. There are only two answers — correct and wrong.
This type of thinking is most often found in people whose scope is associated with certain scientific or typical processes or procedures.
Logical thinking is typical for people with this type of thinking, they can memorize patterns, solve problems and conduct scientific research.
Of course, people have achieved more success in "reading the thoughts" of others than other species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict sensations, intentions, hopes, knowledge and desires of other people.
The most important of these abilities is the understanding of the intentions of others, because it allows us to exclude any potential miserability in case of physical action.
So, if you have to see someone breaking the glass in the car, you're likely to decide that this person is trying to steal someone's car.
However, if he lost the keys to his own car and tried to get into his own car, your assumption would not correspond to reality.
MRI is a technology that is based on a physical phenomenon known as nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR). It was discovered by Felix Bloch (Stanford University) and Edward Persell (Harvard University) in the 1930's.
The magnetic field and radio waves force atoms to generate weak radio signals during this resonance.
In 1970. Raymond Damandian, a doctor of medicine, scientist and researcher, understood how you can use magnetic resonance tomography in medicine to diagnose diseases.
Four years later, the world's first patent in the field of MRI was issued.
Dr. Domadian finished building the first MRI scanner "for the whole body" in 1977. This scanner received the nickname "Unbreakable" from the scientist.
It takes more time to understand and respond to asynchronous interaction.
Thanks to this, students have the opportunity to work at their own pace, as well as control the speed of receipt and processing of educational information.
In addition, this method provides for a smaller number of time restrictions, and also makes it possible to work on a flexible schedule (Bremer, 1998)
Thanks to the Internet and the World Wide Web, students can search or receive information at any time.
In addition, instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can ask questions to teachers at any time — and in most cases they quickly receive an answer.
The postmodern approach to the development of new knowledge implies freedom from absolute principles, prohibitions and values. There is no good way to learn anything.
In fact, there is a large number of things worth studying. Learning takes place through experience between existing knowledge and learners.
This is confirmed by our existing experience of interaction with all educational television shows from the category of "Do it yourself" and information programs.
How often do we watch TV shows, where it is about any process or experience in which we will never be involved and knowledge that we will never need to.
It is unlikely that we will ever deal with the overhaul of a car or the construction of a fountain in the backyard. We will never go to Peru to explore the ancient ruins and will not rebuild the house of a neighbor.
Thanks to the underwater fiber optic cable and broadband satellite communication, 93% of the population of Greenland has Internet access.
Most often, in your hotel or hosts (if you stay in a guest or private house) will be a wy-fi or connected to the Internet by a computer, and an Internet cafe or a place with an affordable wiki is available in all settlements.
As already noted, despite the fact that in the United States the word "Eskimo" remains acceptable, many peoples of the Arctic outside the United States (especially in Canada) consider it humiliating.
Although the word is used among the indigenous population of Greenland, this is not welcome from foreigners.
In Canada, indigenous people of Greenland call themselves inuit, and in Greenland — "kalek" (according to the plural, "Kololithic"). This means "a resident of Greenland" or "Greenland".
Crimes and hostility to foreigners as a whole are a phenomenon that is practically not found in Greenland. There are no dangerous criminal areas even in cities.
The only real danger that an unprepared person may face is cold weather.
If you intend to visit Greenland in the cold season, you need to take with you enough warm clothes (taking into account the fact that the further north you are going, the colder there will be).
Due to the fact that in the summer there are very long days, there may be problems related to sleep shortages, as well as other health problems.
In summer, you should also remember the northern mosquitoes. Although they are not carriers of diseases, but can be very intimidated.
San Francisco's economy is focused on the fact that the city is a world-class attraction among tourists. At the same time, it is diversified.
The most important areas of employment include the sector of professional services, tourism, trade, the financial sector and the government.
This city and its landmarks have become known all over the world due to their frequent reflection in music, films, literature and popular culture.
San Francisco has many opportunities for tourism — there are many hotels, restaurants and first-class conference centers.
In addition, San Francisco is one of the best places in the country where you can taste other cuisines of the peoples of Asia: Thai, Korean, Indian and Japanese.
For many American families, Disney Ward travel is an important pilgrimage.
Arriving at Orlando International Airport, a bus to the Disney Hotel, a week at the site without leaving Disney facilities and returning home — that's what "typical" visit means.
There are an infinite number of possible options, but that's what people mean when they say that "they're going to Disney Warld".
Part of the tickets distributed online through Internet sites such as, for example, Craiglist or eBay, can be used as multi-day universal tickets to visit the park.
Despite the expansion of this practice, it is prohibited by the company "Disney": tickets are not subject to transfer.
If you want to break down the camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon, you need to get permission to visit remote areas of the state.
A limited number of permits is issued to protect the canyon. They can be obtained starting from 1 day of a certain month, four months before the start of the first month of travel.
Accordingly, permission to visit remote areas of the state, which will come into force in May, can be obtained on January 1.
Basically, in areas with the highest number of visitors, among which the "Bright Angel" camping belongs, which next to the ranch "Fantom", the places are filled by fulfilling the needs received on the first day, when these places become available for booking.
According to personal appeals, a limited number of permits reserved for this purpose is issued in the order of the queue.
A wonderful way to see the beauty of the region and get to the places away from the usual tourist routes is to travel in South Africa by car.
Subject to careful planning for this, you can use an ordinary car, but the best option would be all-wheel drive car. In many places, you can only get on all-wheel drive car with a high cart base.
Keep in mind when you make a plan that although in South Africa the situation is stable, in neighboring countries this is far from the case.
Different countries have different requirements for visa and its cost. In addition, these requirements may be determined by what country you are from.
In addition, each country has its own, inherent only to it, legislation in this area. The mentioned laws prescribe what things are meant to be in emergency assistance, you need to have in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe, which is located near Botswana, on the border with Livingston in Zambia.
The city is located in close proximity to the main attraction — waterfalls. In addition, this popular tourist destination offers both fans of attractions and adventurers a lot of opportunities to stay here longer.
From November to March, that is, during the rainy season, the volume of water is increasing, and the waterfall itself looks much more impressive.
If you walk on a bridge or one of the paths that wrap the waterfall, you will definitely get wet.
At the same time, it is because of such a huge amount of water that it will be difficult for you to see the waterfall itself, because all this water will cover it!
The Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). It is possible that KV62 is the most famous burial place in the valley, where in 1922 Howard Carter found almost an intact grave of a young tsar.
The tomb of Tutankhamun is unlikely to be visited, unlike most other king's tombs. It's much smaller and it's pretty much sloppy.
All those who wish to see what damage caused the mummies of attempts to get it out of the coffin, will be disappointed, for you can only see the head and shoulders of Pharaoh.
The grave no longer has any fabulous wealth — they were transferred to the Cairo Museum of Egyptian Culture.
It is better for visitors to spend time somewhere else if they are limited.
12 km southwest of the city of Siemreapu is the temple of Phnom-Krom. This temple building on top of the hill appeared at the end of the 9 century, when King Yashavarman reigned.
It is necessary to climb the mountain to admire the gloomy atmosphere of the temple and Lake Tonle Sap.
Boat riding on a lake and visiting this place can be easily combined.
Going to Tonla Sap, do not forget to take a passport, because in order to go to the temple, you must have a pass to Angkor.
The capital and largest city in Israel is Jerusalem, despite the fact that most countries, together with the UN, do not recognize its status as a capital.
The ancient city, located on the Jewish mountains, has an interesting thousand-year history.
The followers of the three monotheistic religions — Christianity, Islam and Judaism — consider this city sacred to be sacred, which serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel due to its religious significance, as well as numerous attractions located in the Old Town. 
In addition to the busy and crowded shopping malls, cafes and restaurants in Jerusalem, there are many historical, archaeological and cultural attractions.
According to Ecuador's request, citizens of Cuba must receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador through international airports or border checkpoints.
This letter, which must meet certain requirements, must be certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.
The aim of the above-mentioned requirements is to ensure an orderly flow of migrants between the two countries.
Those citizens of Cuba who have a residence permit in the United States should visit the Ecuadorian consulate to be exempted from the need to comply with this requirement.
At least 6 months after the travel date, your passport must be valid. To confirm the period of stay, you need a ticket there and back and forth or a ticket to a third country.
For large groups, tours cost less, so if you travel on your own or together with just one friend, it will be better to get acquainted with other travelers and gather in a group of four to six people, so that the costs per one will decrease.
Tourists are often moved to fill the machines, so there's really no reason to worry about it.
This, in fact, is more like trying to make people believe that they will have to pay more.
This is a steep mountain, against which photos of ruins are often taken, towering over the northern part of Machu Picchu.
For the most part, physically trained people can overcome this complex and cool lift in about 45 minutes, although from the bottom it looks a little scary.
Along most of the road, stone steps are laid, and in steeper areas you can hold on steel cables, which perform the function of railings.
And yet, you may not have enough air. Be careful and careful in steeper areas, especially if the soil is wet soil under your feet, because it can be dangerous.
The path goes through a small cave, which is located near the top. It's very low and narrow.
It is best to inspect the places and get acquainted with the wildlife of the Galápagas Islands from the boat, as it is in 1835. made by Charles Darwin.
Over 60 cruise ships make flights in the Galapaga waters — their size varies from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book a place in advance (because the ship usually has no free seats in the middle of the season).
The agent through which you will make a reservation must be a specialist in the Galápago Islands, which is well versed in a variety of ships.
Thanks to this, you will find yourself on a ship that best suits your personal interests and (or) limitations.
Northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas until the Spaniards came in the 16 century. At the same time, the central and southern Chile were inhabited by indigenous Aravkans (Mapuce).
In addition, Mapuche was one of the last independent groups of American indigenous peoples, which were not completely swallowed during hispanic domination. This only happened after Chile gained independence.
The decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818, despite the fact that Chile declared independence in 1810. (Against the background of the Napoleonic wars, when Spain was left without an effective central government for several years.)
The Dominican Republic (which is Spanish-called República Dominicana) belongs to the Caribbean. Together with Haiti, she is located on the island of Espagñola, occupying the eastern part of the latter.
The country can not only boast of white sandy beaches and mountain scenery. In addition, there is also the oldest European city on the American continent, which nowadays is part of Santo Domingo.
Initially, the island was inhabited by the Taina and Caribbean people. The language used by Caribbeans, who sailed to the island in about 10 000 years BC. e., it was called Arakan. 
The Spanish conquerors have significantly reduced the number of Tain people over the few years that have passed since European researchers arrived.
According to the data that Frey Bartholome de Las Casas cited in his book "Indian Treaty", Spanish conquerors from 1492 to 1498. destroyed approximately 100 000 tain.
Jardin de la Union. It was built as an atrium for the 17th century women's monastery, where the Temple de San Diego is the only surviving building to our time.
Now it performs the role of the central square, and there always — day and night — something happens.
The garden is surrounded by several restaurants, and the central pavilion in the day and evening often becomes a platform for free concerts.
Kalechon del Bessa (or Alley Kiss). The old legend of love still lives on two balconies, the distance between which is only 69 centimeters.
Children can tell you this story in just a few penches.
Popular day trips or excursions to the island of Bouen, during which you can ride kayaki, walk on foot, visit shops, restaurants and much more.
This original location is located in the Gulf of Hau Saund near Vancouver. You can get a water taxi here without any problems. They depart from the island of Granville, in the center of Vancouver, and walk on schedule.
Fans of outdoor activities should definitely take a walk on the "Corridor from sea to sky".
The Wistler town (which is 1.5 hours away from Vancouver) is an expensive but well-known resort, because in 2010 the Winter Olympic Games were held here.
In winter, you are pleased to welcome the best ski resorts in North America, and in the summer you can enjoy riding on a real mountain bike.
Permissions must be ordered. To spend the night in Siren, you need a proper permit.
"Sirena" is the only forestry, where, in addition to the camp parking, you will be offered accommodation in a hostel and hot dishes. In La Leono, San Peddilla and Los Patas you will only be offered a place for camp parking without food.
Permission to visit the park can be obtained directly in the forest in Puerto Chimenas, but credit cards are not accepted there
The Park Service (under the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications) issues permits for visiting the park no earlier than one month before the expected date of arrival.
"Cafenet El Sol" offers a booking service, with a commission of $30 (or $10, when it comes to daily subscriptions). More information can be found on the page of the National Park "Karkavada".
Cook Islands are an island country in Polynesia. It is located in the middle of the South Pacific and has the status of a self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand.
The area of this archipelago, which includes 15 islands, exceeds 2.2 million km2 of the ocean.
These islands are often perceived as "inverted Hawaii" due to being in the same time zone as Hawaii. 
Although these islands are smaller in size, they resemble Hawaii's elderly tourists of the period when they were not yet part of the United States and there were no huge hotels and other buildings.
There are no cities on the Cook Islands. It consists of 15 different islands. Raratonga and Aitutaka are the largest of them.
Nowadays, in developed countries, hotel services from the category "long night and breakfast" in the luxury segment have become truly art.
Obviously, in the elite segment of the hotel type "lodging and breakfast" compete on two main parameters: bed and breakfast.
In the best objects of this type, in this way, you can find the most luxurious beds — an ancient bed or handmade patchwork blanket.

All this can get in an ancient historical building with antique furniture, next to which there is a well-groomed playground with a pool.
Sitting in your own car and going on a long journey — it's so easy and so attractive.
You probably already know how to drive your car, and is familiar with its limitations, which can hardly be said about large cars.
Undesirable attention is easy to attract private property or city of any size.
In short, your own car is perfect for travel, but it is not very convenient to use as a tent for recreation.
The camping in the car will be more comfortable if you are the owner of an SUV, a large minivan, a sedan or a station wagon with decomposing seats.
The legacy of some hotels went to them from the golden age of ocean liners and steam railways, which began before the Second World War, in the 19th or early 20th century.
In these hotels, rich and famous people spent time, often offered here excellent food and night entertainment.
In addition, the creation of their image is influenced by old-fashioned fittings, and the lack of the latest amenities, and a certain refined and elegant obsolescence.
They from time to time stop heads of state and other high-ranking officials, despite the fact that, as a rule, such hotels are privately owned.
If the traveler has a lot of money, he can choose a round-the-world flight with accommodation in many of these hotels.
The organization, known as the "Hospitality Exchange Network", connects travelers and local residents in the cities that they plan to visit.
Usually, to join such a network, you just need to fill out an online registration form. However, some networks require or offer to undergo additional verification.
In this case, a list of available hosts is placed in print and/or on the Internet, sometimes with links and reviews of other travelers.
The international guest network "Couchsurfing" was founded by the programmer Casey Fenton in January 2004, after he found a cheap flight to Iceland, but he had no place to stay.

Antarctica, in the center of which is the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Travel travel is quite expensive and you need to have good physical training for them. In addition, they are possible only in the summer, from November to February, and are mainly limited to the territory of the islands, peninsula, as well as the Ross Sea.
In the summer, on four dozen bases, mainly in certain areas, there are several thousand employees living here; in the winter season there is only a small number of them.
The continental Antarctica is a deserted space, which is covered with a layer of ice in 2-3 km thick.
Occasionally special air tours are held in the mainland of Antarctica. There are tourists who want to do mountain climbing or see the South Pole, where the large base is located.
The McMerda-South Poly (or just a Highway) is a temporary road long 1600 km from the McMerd station on Mori Ross to the Southern Pole.

Leaning roads, sidewalks, road surfaces and, in particular, steps — these are the typical causes of accidents in the winter.
I'm going to need a good idea to have a suitable mattress. On the ice and snow, even some winter shoes do not allow you to feel confident that there is already talk about summer shoes, which will be quite slippery.
The relief of the soles should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material from which it is made itself should remain in the cold soft enough.
Some of them have spikes on. In addition, there are special additional devices with spikes for slippery conditions, suitable for any type of shoes — both separately for heels and heels and soles together.
The heels must be low and wide. Often, in order to improve the clutch, sand, gravel or salt are scattered on the roads or paths.  
Avalanches are not something unusual; steep slopes are able to contain only a certain part of the snow — excess goes down in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky. Therefore, to collapse, he needs some kind of trigger mechanism, and such a trigger can be snow falling down.
In some cases, the trigger can be the sun, which heats snow, a large number of snowfalls, other natural phenomena, often human.
A tornado is an airy pillar with an extremely low pressure that rotates. He tightens the air inward and upward.
They are capable of generating a terrible wind (often 100-200 miles per hour). As the tornado moves, heavy objects can rise into the air and be transferred on it.
First, a funnel drops from the thunderstorm cloud. It turns into a "tornado" only when it touches the ground.
The use of the services of personal VPN providers (which stands for "virtual private networks") allows you to avoid not only political censorship, but also bypass commercial geofiltration on IP.
They are better than a web proxy according to several indicators — they redirect not only http, but all Internet traffic.
As a rule, such providers offer higher bandwidth of Internet channels and the highest quality of service. All traffic is encrypted, and thus spying becomes harder.
Reflecting on the goals of this practice, media companies consistently lie that it is aimed at "preventing piracy".

In addition, there is no need to receive a local number where you live. You can directly connect to the satellite Internet somewhere in the village of Chiken in Alaska and choose a number that will mask your location under the solar Arizona.
Often you have to separately purchase a global number, which allows you to accept calls from the public telephone network. The location of such a number is important only for the people who call you.
Real-time text translation programs are programs that automatically translate from one language to another full text segments.
Some programs from this category are even able to translate texts written in a foreign language on signs or other real-world objects — you just need to put a smartphone on them.
Very improved translation engines, now they often offer quite good translations (all less nonsense), but be careful, they can still make mistakes.

For short-term visits as a tourist or as part of a business trip to some countries, you do not need a visa. But international students are usually abroad for a longer time than on a regular tourist trip.
As a rule, to get the opportunity to stay in any country abroad for a long time, you need to get a visa in advance.
In general, the requirements and procedure for filing applications for student visas differ from the requirements and submission of applications for regular tourist or business visas.

The White Sea-Baltic Canal through the Onega Lake, Ladoga Lake and St. Petersburg connects (mainly along the rivers and lakes) the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea.
The transition from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible, because Onezh Lake is also associated with Volga.
You can be sure that once you get to the pier or the dock, everything will become obvious. With you will share the information other travelers who also travel on satellite boats.

Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airways have significantly increased the number of flights to Africa. They offer flights to many major cities in Africa at more attractive rates than other European airlines.
As of 2014, the Turkish Airlines company has operated flights to 30 African countries on 39 routes.
If you have extra time in flight, compare how your total air travel tariff to Africa is related to the global tariff.
When planning the cost of traveling to places located outside of Africa, be sure to take into account the additional costs of visas, travel taxes, land transport, etc. 
The choice of flights and destinations for those who want to fly around the world completely in the southern hemisphere is limited due to the insufficient number of transo-Chaine routes.
In the southern hemisphere, no alliance of airlines offers trans-Acaine flights in all three directions (and "SkyTim" does not offer any of them).
Nevertheless, the activities of the Star Alliance extend to all directions, with the exception of the southeastern Pacific Ocean — from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti. In this area fly airliners who are part of the alliance "LATAM Wanourld".
If you want to bypass the southern part of the Pacific Ocean and the west coast of South America, there are other opportunities other than that flight (see. below).

Although varieties of French, which is spoken in Belgium and in Switzerland, and are quite similar to their speakers understand each other, they are still slightly different from the one they speak in France.
So, in particular, in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland, the number system is slightly different from what is accepted in French, which is spoken in France. There is also a slight difference in the pronunciation of some words.
Despite this, all Belgians and Swiss who can speak French, taught in school exactly the standard French language, and therefore could understand you, even if you are using a standard French numbering system.
Waving with your hand is in many regions of the world a friendly gesture, which means "hello".
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malays living in rural areas, that is, "go here". The mentioned gesture is similar to a gesture when the index finger is bent in the direction of the body. The latter is used in certain Western countries and should be used only in this way.
Also, a traveler from the UK can, while in Spain, accept as a request to return a gesture, if he waves his hand at a farewell (hand to the one who waves, and not the one who is waving).
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages that have been created to promote communication between different peoples, which would otherwise be difficult to communicate with each other.
They exist separately from the middle languages of the lingua franca. The latter are organic or natural languages, which, for one reason or another, become dominant and used as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat, travelers can observe mirages, which is forced to believe in the presence of water (or any other things).
Mirages can be in danger if the traveler tries to follow them. Thus, it will waste invaluable energy and water residues.

In Rugalan and Agder, they are often referred to as "hay", which translates as "forless heathless void".
Glaciers are not marked by stability. It's fair to say that they're coming out of the mountain. As a result, cracks appear, which can be hidden under snow bridges.
The cracks can be closed, and the walls and roofs of ice caves will collapse.
On the edge of the glaciers break off, fall and, probably, bounce or roll away from the edge of the huge pieces of ice.
The peak of the tourist season in mountain villages usually fell on the babany of summer.
