The formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagasian Islands is written in a study published in the journal Science on Thursday.
According to the researchers of Princeton University (U.S.) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species has occurred in just two generations, although earlier it was assumed that this process takes much more time. The emergence of a new species became possible thanks to the intersection of the endemic earthworm (Geospiza fortes) with the non-stubby cactus earthen yurk (Geospiza conirostris).
Various shapes can be cast from gold. It can be rolled out on thin sheets.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which then there is no problem to twist and braid. You can, in addition, tear it out or roll it out in letters.
It can be made very thin and attached to the second metal. It could be so subtle that from time to time with its help the illustrations painted in the books — the so-called "consecrated manuscripts" were decorated.
This is called the level of pH of a certain chemical substance. You can make yourself such an acid-based indicator from the juice of red-rolled cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The level of pH in the experimental chemical substance is determined on the basis of the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in the pH).
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as you know, one proton and one electron are included in the composition of the hydrogen atom.
Stirry these two dry powders in a circle until they are connected into a single whole, and then make a ball with wet hands.

You use a companion when you call someone who is thousands of miles away.
In space, the satellite takes the bell, after which almost instantly displays it back.
The missile was used to send satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space, because due to the influence of the earth's atmosphere, light is refracted and the picture is distorted.
In order for a telescope or satellite to be able to enter space, a huge rocket is needed more than 100 feet high.
The circle has changed the world in an incredible way. The lighter and faster movement is the biggest of what the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to it, we had trains, cars and many other vehicles.
Below are the middle cats. Their prey is also of medium size — they hunt both rabbits and antelopes with deer.
In addition, many small cats (including pets in free walk) catch and eat more small prey — insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is that everyone takes their own niche, ed. z. has a characteristic of it only function, and therefore it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most sociable cats: they live in large flocks, which are known as Prides.
The Pride may include up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lions squirrels and a pack of wolves or dogs are similar in many ways. The latter can be strongly in the behavior of lions (but not the second large cats) in that they pose a deadly danger to mining.
The tiger is able to climb (but not so good), jump over long distances, swim and pull with force five times stronger than a strong person, like a well-trained athlete.
Tiger belongs to the same group with lions, leopards and jaguars (the panther family). No other cat, except for these four, can not growl.
The tiger's roaring resembles a sentence consisting of sharp and loud words than a full-sounding lion's roar.
Acelotes are used as a food for small animals. If possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes and birds. Almost all the animals he hunts are much smaller than that of acelot.
Scientists believe that the acelots are being pursued and found prey by smelling, sniffing traces on the ground.
Thanks to the night vision, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. Hunting acelots, merging with the environment and from hiding the attacking on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (small population) breaks away from the main population from which they come (say, when moving across a river or a mountain range, or if such living beings migrate to a new island, so it will be quite difficult to get back to them), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from where they came from.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need other traits or devices compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, animals are less and less reminiscent of the main population, from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, or later, the two mentioned populations will look like that in different ways that no one will think of taking them to the same species.
This process we call type formation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speculation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe. They, in addition to this, use carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants "cook" food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also give a shadow.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We eat predominantly plants. Animals wouldn't survive without plants.
For their time, the masauds were super-predators, so they were not afraid of anything and anyone other masasaurs.
On its long jaws, more than 70 sharp as a razor of teeth, and in the upper part of the mouth was another additional row. This meant that his production would not be able to escape.
It is not known, but it is possible that he had a broken tongue. The manozov's diet consisted of large fish, turtles and other masausaurs. It is likely that they could also be eaten and representatives of their species.
In addition, he pounced on everything that had fallen into the water; his tray was not even worthy of a giant such as the tyrannosaur Rex.
Despite the fact that their food would not have been surprising, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them — wild, peacocks, snails and one of the rodents, known as nutmards.
Another difference was that when the poor and women were eating, sitting on chairs, the wealthy arranged banquets on which they ate and at the same time rested.
The composition of the dishes prepared in ancient Rome could not include products that came to Europe from America or Asia later.
They did not, in particular, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa. It should be added that no ancient Romans have ever had the opportunity to taste a turkey.
To each of his gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built the main temple, which was considered his home.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs, holding in their honor various holidays and ceremonies.
In each temple there was the own inner courtyard and sanctuary, where only priests could visit.
In some cases, special towers were erected during the construction of temples, similar to the pyramids. They were known as zigurates.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to God.

Between peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, there were many differences, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandina".
If you watched the film "Treasure of the Nation", you may think that on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something really is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, was written: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The entry inverted form is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that a large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was curtailed for preservation at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it may well be that this record was added there simply as a mark.
Thanks to the landing in Normandy and subsequent battles managed to liberate the north of France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the rule of "vishystas". These were the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the operation "Dragon" began — the allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" in just two weeks liberated the southern territories of France, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is the only culture of a fairly large group of people who work together and live in society.
The above-mentioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, Minsk. ie, "civil". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, that is, "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". All this, in turn, in turn, says something about the size of society.
The cities-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transfer of knowledge through generations, the uniform spread and sustainable cultural trail.
Often small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear, leaving without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first founded a weak central government in accordance with the Agreement on the establishment of the Confederation of thirteen states. This government consisted of only Congress.
The Congress did not have the authority to introduce taxes, and since the national executive and judicial power did not exist, he hoped to ensure compliance with all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not set for interaction.
In addition, he did not have the authority to abolish the tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the Treaty on the establishment of the confederation, it was necessary to unanimous consent of all states, and the states did not take seriously the central government that their representatives were often absent there.

The history of Taiwan began in the 15 century. It was then that his name was recorded by European sailors passing by like "Pharmosa" — this meant "a beautiful island".
In 1624. The Dutch East India Company has established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated the reform of the primitive practice of breadmaking. For the processing of rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) in 1683. captured the western and northern Taiwan territories and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) the Qing Government in 1895. signed a Simonoseque Treaty, according to which Japan was transferred the right of sovereignty over the island, and the latter went to Taiwan until 1945.
The composition of Machu-Picchu includes three main objects: Incihuatana, the temple of the Sun and the Room with three windows.
So that tourists could get a better idea of how most of the buildings originally looked at the edges of the complex, the latter were rebuilt.
Until 1976. thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. The restoration work is still ongoing.
So, the most popular photo format in the world for fixed frames is the format of 35 mm. On the slope of the era of analog photography, this format of the film prevailed.
Such a film is still produced now, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width and height is now used in the formats of the matrix of digital cameras.
It can slightly confuse, but in fact the 35 mm format has 36 mm wide and 24 mm in height.
Accordingly, it is believed that the ratio of the parties for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain an easier proportion of whole digits) — 3:2.
The same or similar aspect ratio has many common formats (for example, the family of APS formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often exposed to attacks and ridicule, is simple tips that provide dynamism and at the same time retain a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, the best place to place the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photo in the vertical and horizontal planes to the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, were paid to close attention.
With all those linguistic and cultural differences that took place, the Christian religion united European countries for more than a thousand years.
All — from king to straight-manage — were under its all-permeable power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and facilitate suffering, and that this is why there are funds of the church.
For more than a thousand years, the central church authorities were in Rome. Due to this concentration of power and money, many wonder if this dogma is being performed.
Britain initiated the sea blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.

In ancient China, there were unique ways to refer to different eras. At every stage of the history of China or in every family, there were distinctive dynasties in power.
In addition, periods of the reign of the dynasties were separated by periods of separated provinces, when instability prevailed. The most famous of them was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles who fought for the throne, led to each other ruthless fighting.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to take the highest place in the large palace in Xi'i.
The French Revolution had many social and political implications. Among them is the transition from absolutism to the republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism and the belief that the country belongs not to the individual ruler, but to the entire people.
In addition, various positions after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious broke into the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier military ranks were assigned, based on the estate, now — on the basis of skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries, the French Revolution inspired to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in the questions that went beyond the world's life. To do meditation and reflect, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (translated as "light"), which is known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual attitudes of Mohammed.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world — it is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if anyone knows about its existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
In addition to the pure beautiful sky at the top and many surrounding mountains you will see nothing. From the cave very little of this world you can see and hear.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to our time.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the pharaoh-dead. It was built in the third century BC.

Under the term "technological determinism" understands a number of practical ideas, from pressure in order to promote certain technologies or technical need to clearly understand that human destiny is due to the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their embodiment in the field of technology.
Two common ideas are typical for most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, make inherent only to them (and not socially conditioned) influence on society. 
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, the nationwide network of highways does not make much sense. For this reason, new methods of production are underway, which will reduce the cost of owning a car.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of health, which allows you to treat various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, which was influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of romanticism.
If we talk about the era of Romanticism, people were strongly influenced by the geography of presence. Over time, there were traditions and culture associated with it. They were better than arbitrarily introduced laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and the position that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the capital of fashion in feudal times.
around 400 N.C. e. The city gains fame as an epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status as a luxury capital is blocked. This happened, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, among which were spices and silk, and they were valued much higher than they offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople entered the title of the capital of fashion in Paris.
The heyday of Gothic style came for the period between 10 and 11, as well as on the 14th century.
At first, Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on the style of clothing.
However, Western styles can be late for 25-30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people as a result of the Crusade began to use buttons to fasten clothes, was among the largest events of that time.
In natural agriculture, such a amount of food is produced, which only provides the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is a simple and, as a rule, an organic system. It is based on the use of a proper ecological region of preserved seeds in combination with crop rotation or other not complex methods. The goal of all this is to reach the maximum yield.
Many farmers have historically conducted a natural agriculture. Many third world countries are still practicing this.
Subcultures bring people together with similar views, who from the position of social norms feel deprived of attention, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and (or) gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
Definition of a separate subculture can occur on the basis of various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often determine their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manner of behavior and jargon.
As an illustration of what is socialization and how important it is, most often give an example with children who are not lucky enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various hardships or insults and which adults did not socialize in childhood.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children were imprisoned for a long time (usually so their own parents were treated); in some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of a reluctance from parents to notice serious physical or intellectual disorders and shortcomings in the child.
Before they left or they fled, wild children could be subjected to serious abuse or survive the injury.
Others, as if brought up animals; by rumor, some lived independently in the wild.
When a child was fully brought up by animals, his behavior in almost everything (given physical limitations) reflect the behavior of the educator animal: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project training is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Skofolding is not a method of learning, but rather an assistant who helps people gain new experience in their studies. This can mean the use of new computer programs or the beginning of a new project.
Helpers can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants are both a teacher and a small paperwork in the Microsoft Office program.
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed in order to ask questions, make hints and explain the procedures with which it is difficult for a student or listener to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children can be in foster families. It can be cruel treatment, neglect, and even coercion.
It is impossible to allow children to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, they are not brought up and do not engage in their education, but this is still happening.
In our opinion, the system of adoptive families is a safe zone for such children.
It is assumed that thanks to our system of foster families, wards will have reliable health care, safe homes, good and caring caregivers and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family should provide all the needs of the child who were not satisfied in the house from where he was taken away.
The Internet is a means of not only mass communication, but also interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet are additional opportunities for its use and meet the needs of the audience.
For example, it is suggested that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are significant motives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal participation" and "permanent relationship" were also defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when researching the audience's response to Internet sites.
Thanks to the video, important discoveries were made in the explanation of microculses — referring to the movements of the facial muscles, which lasts only a few milliseconds.
It is argued, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microcuts can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work, Oliver Saxe's speech noted by which people with a damaged brain, without realizing the speech itself, can, nevertheless, accurately appreciate the sincerity.
He even suggests that animals — for example, domestic dogs — can also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The results of the 20th century studies suggest that there are two funds for genetic variability, namely, obvious and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutations, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection they are removed from the pool of the detected.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination mix variations in these two pools.
In the owl, the available plant resources cannot meet the need for primates in amino acids if their digestive system is similar to human.
Moreover, if they fail to do so, the consequences are serious. This is malnutrition, depression of growth, and inevitable death.
The most affordable herbal resources would be proteins that can be found in legumes and foliage. However, if they are not properly prepared, then organisms such primates as we are difficult to digest.
On the contrary, the food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of protein rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily absorbed.
Apparently, it is not surprising if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" almost in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savana in our time.
By interrupting sleep refers to the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can achieve this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you are moving your watch in a dream, try to put it at the other end of the room. So, you'll need to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other options based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of liquid (primarily water or tea known diuretic before bedtime) — this makes a person get up at night to urinate.
The inner peace of man is contrary to the proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The existing vitality is even more positive than lower the tension. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle in this way is our own negative and tension.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of the Buddha, which was supplemented by the love of the Mahayan and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It brings together meditations, Kundalini Yoga and love for all mankind.
Followers of Yoga Kundalini argue that in order to awaken the energy of Kundalini (energy enlightenment), certain yoga poses, mantras and visualizations, and perform breathing exercises.
 Divine yoga is the main part in the practice of Tibetan meditation. Visualization of various gods allows you to clear energy channels, open chakras and achieve enlightened consciousness. 
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, so that the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between countries.
Two years after the end of the hostilities, the Cold War begins — the former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and the army of friendly countries really fought in it. The battlefields were in different regions — from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken until September 17, 1939. The retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, in just one night, these plans lost meaning, since more than 800 000 soldiers of the Red Army as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The transportation of goods by the ship is clearly the most effective way to transport a large number of people and cargo through the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of naval forces was set so that their country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time the enemy would not be able to transfer their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most significant examples of this idea. In order to help the UK, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop the mentioned movement, using mainly submarines.
Germany could probably conquer the UK in the same way as it won the rest of Europe if the allies failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated in the Iranian mountains of Zagros about 10 000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient crops and tribes began to breed them in order to always have milk, wool, meat and leather at hand.
Usually home goats graze in herds, wandering through the hills or other pastures. Often they were looked after by Cossacks — children or adolescents. The latter played the role of shepherds. That's how animals are still in the present day.
Already in the 16 century, guzhov roads were built in England.
Although the puddle roads were just parallel wooden boards, they allowed thrush horses to move at a higher speed and pull cargo with more weight than on existing uneven roads.
The sleeping slates were used to keep the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that the movement on the rails will be more effective if they are covered with a strip of iron.
This practice has become widespread, but due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the cars went out faster.
After some time, the iron came to replace the wooden wheels. The first all made of metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homa erectus (which means "person walking out"), people began to walk in a vertical position.
Australopithecs, their predecessors, usually did not go directly.
The austrolopical individuals of the Australopithecus are found in fossils, whose age is 4.2–3.9 million years, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago, the Sachelantrop took two legs.
You can be more conscious about the environment, you can become a member of the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future the mentioned sufferings are not very strong.
Often it looks more like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a temporary solution, then we must find and destroy the root of the problems.
It is obvious that thanks to the technical and scientific achievements of mankind, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overcrowding and wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, her manuscript, signed by Congress's Chairman John Hankak and Secretary Charles Thomson, was taken to the printing house of John Danlop, which was located in several blocks from there.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies, known now as the "Dunlape Sheet", was made.
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read the document in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies he read on July 9 with his troops in New York. On August 10, another person came to London.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides have survived to this day). The original manuscript has not survived.
Many of the modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has managed to survive and that it still exists, only we call them birds.
Because of the feathers and the ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But the birds still have many in common features with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs, and, like tyrannosaurus, walk on two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary numbers may include only one of the two values — 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (on computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The internal poisoning may first of all be evidenced by open capacity with pills or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for the provision of urgent medical care for this particular poison must be looked at the label.
To refer to this group of insects, entomologists use the term "blamp" in a formal sense.
This term arose, because people have long known what bed bugs are — these insects, which is highly adapted to parasiticism in humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs are nesting parasites, they are accustomed to life in the nests or in the house of their master.
About 400 000 cases of multiple sclerosis (RS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is the main problem among adults of young and middle-aged.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optical nerve.
According to the study, it was found that women twice as likely to men suffer from PC.
A couple may come to the conclusion that the upbringing of the baby does not meet their interests or interests of the child that they already have.
Such couples can give their child to adopt.
When adopting the adoption of the parents of the child, their parents refuse their parental rights to raise and educate him.
The main purpose of science is to find out through the scientific method of functioning of the world. In fact, most scientific research is carried out with the help of this method.
However, it is not just him. The experiment (this is a test that is carried out to exclude one or more possible hypotheses with the help of questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Most of all, philosophers and naturalists paid to classical texts. First of all, we are talking about the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's generally accepted views at that time were considered to be the opinions of Aristotle on all scientific issues, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who knew the Greek language decreased, the West was detached from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms that can be observed in animal behavior and physiology are highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms were recorded, which are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is an autonomous process. Even if the signals from outside do not arrive, the mentioned process continues in the form of independent free-current cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that claimed that DNA is a genetic material was tested during the Hersha and Cheise experiment.
To implant your own DNA, the bacteria of Khersha and Chase used phags or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, during which, through radioactive phosphorus, the DNA of bacteriophage or through radioactive sulfur — the protein of bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of a fragment of the genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it by the cells of the embryonic line, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Inheritance can only be mutations in germ cells. The result of other mutations may be the death of cells or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who have interest in visiting various natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including enjoying the observations of flora and fauna.
As an example of what you can do in nature, you can give fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks and exploring ecosystems.
As an example, you can give a visit, study and photograph of orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People go every morning in their cars from small provincial cities to go to work. On the way, they pass by other people who work there, from where they just left.
In this dynamic transport turn, everyone has a particular relationship to and maintains the transport system based on private vehicles.
Scientific evidence suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to the evolution of man over the past two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who take part in the life of society. Almost all of them are not satisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about the fall of bridges or water quality.
Why transport systems are a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly cease to act? Is there a reason for the lack of computer engineers? Is there anything more important?
The concept of "transport traffic" implies an analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is a complex problem, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, transport flows are characterized by a certain rationally conditioned sequence and can be roughly described with the help of mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively show what is the movement of vehicles, it has been established, as its three main parameters are interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The presence of these links helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as engage in their operation.
The first of the animals in the air were insects. The ability to fly has helped them to avoid enemies more effectively, and also find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are formed along the body.
Thanks to this, they can get into different very small places to hide there from predators.
Dragonfly and one-day flies are in our time the only insects that cannot fold wings.
One person named Aristarchus several thousand years ago claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many adhered to another opinion — that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because, being on the Earth, it's hard to say that it is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River ranks second on Earth in length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times more than in the river, which ranks second.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
Amazon is a source of at least 20 percent of all water entering the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, into which waters from thousands of smaller rivers are flooded, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although the construction of the pyramids using the stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, in terms of size and technical perfection of building, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom came to delight from their ancestors monuments, whose age at that time exceeded a thousand years.
There are only about 800 people in the Vatican. It is the smallest country in the world with the least population.
In the law and official messages of the Vatican use the Italian language.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as a daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Due to the fact that the main chemical elements (e.g., gold, silver and copper) are found in nature by natural form and they are relatively simply extracted with the help of primitive tools, people knew about them in ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that any thing included one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (land, water, fire and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although, according to its theory, they can transform into other substances to eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements are similar to calcium and potassium, considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, which include a small number of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything is made in the universe. All matter consists of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that the point that stands at the end of this sentence, they will be located trillions.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new methods of writing appear.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a sharpener.
We can only guess what fate will befall the keyboard, if it will replace something fundamentally new.
The principle of operation of the plutonium bomb is to use the energy of nuclear synthesis when a nucleus is formed with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like a very heavy stroller on the hill. The re-sification of the nucleus will release part of this energy.
The nucleus of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to disintegrate with a slight external influence or without it at all.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called punishment.
The thickness of the currich on the side is about 70 km, and on the far side — about 100 km.
Under the moonlong dreams, the bark of the moon is thinner, and under the highlands — more thick.
The lunar seas may be more on the side of the moon closest to us, because there is a thinner bark, and, accordingly, it was easier to climb the surface.
The theories are based on what drives people or that they are attracted to.
These theories proceed from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires that they turn into internal and who give subjective nature (otherwise, internalize) during maturation. 
These theories describe what it is forcing individuals to want what they do, and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
Theory of the hierarchy of needs of Maslov and "Two-factorial Theory" by Hertzberg represent two authoritative meaningful theories.
In fact, if managers lead their former colleagues, there may be two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain "his boyfriend" (or "his girlfriend").
The manager of this type may experience difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of work, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, the distribution of responsibility and bringing the perpetrators to justice.
Another extreme is the situation when a person changes beyond recognition — it feels the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and assign it to himself.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often this type of behavior ends with quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
The standards of excellence for conventional teams must be followed by virtual teams, but there are small differences.
Usually, virtual team members perform the role of the contact center for a corresponding real group.
Given that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be clear to local leadership.
Another unique component of the distributed virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of managers to which each of the members obeys is the so-called "invisible team". It defines the standards for each member.
What is the reason why the organization wants to go through a long procedure for the formation of an educational organization? Innovation is one of the goals of application of organizational concepts of training in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can be expressed when all the available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization.
Thus, the process used by an organization whose employees are trying to overcome some obstacle together can lead to a new innovative process, a satisfactory customer needs.
The management of the organization should create a culture for which innovation, knowledge exchange and organizational training are characteristic. Only after that the organization can be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continental approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of cognition is reinforced by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the research area narrows and becomes more accurate.
The results of the research received by the scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that different types of traumatic brain injuries, focal damage, formations, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain have an effect on behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes in it are still unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we get a huge amount of materials and data to build simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that are taking place in our mind.
Although usually the term "artificial intelligence" and causes associations with science fiction, in fact, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, learning process, and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence include attempts to force machines to automate the tasks to perform which it is necessary for the machines to behave wisely.
As an example, you can give planning and control, the ability to respond to requests and technical problems in customers, as well as recognize faces, voices and handwriting.
They are allocated to separate disciplines that study problems from real life and offer solutions for them.
Nowadays, the AI is often used in economics, medicine, technical and military spheres. In addition, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
The tours make up a significant part of school. Teachers often take students to places that cannot be accessed by car.
With the help of modern technologies, you can organize virtual excursions. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or admire the beauty of art. And all this — without leaving the class.
Joint participation in virtual excursions is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experience in classes in the future.
Students of the Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, about their journey to the state capital, every year, make a website, and every year they redo it, but old versions remain online.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language. Although at the beginning of blogging grammar and spelling in them often "lample", this, as a rule, changes for the better, due to the presence of an audience.
Given that students are usually the most picky audience, the author of the blog to avoid criticism is doing everything possible to improve their style.
In addition, blogging "helps students to better understand the world around them". The need to maintain the audience's interest inspires them and makes them remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004). 
Blogging promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students will use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; an active reaction to online materials will help students outline their own position to what other people, as well as express their own views on individual problems" (Orovets, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, which give the opportunity to get acquainted with the past of the country and its present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and in the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
That is why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
On large parts of its territory, which are further to the north, there are very few people, and some even represent an almost deserted desert.
For comparison, the population can be cited as the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the United States exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located near the east coast of Africa and belong to the Indian Ocean Islands.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. If we talk about wildlife, it can be compared with a separate continent.
Almost all islands are smaller or are independent states, or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and the island of Mayot.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, dates back to European influence and the politics of colonialism.
The northern border of this region is Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women are advised to always say that they are married, even if it is not.
In addition, it may be useful to wear a ring (such that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may face behavior that will give them a charasment. Locals can often bite tourists, grab their hands, and so on.
Deciduously refuse men and boldly defend your opinion (despite the cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca in the 10 century BC was founded by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the 1755 earthquake, they left the place.
The Moroccan Sultan restored the city and called it Daru L. Bodzya. The name Casablanca city was derived from Spanish traders who created shopping bases there.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Near the Old Town of Medina you can quickly find places where traditional Moroccan products — leather products, pottery, Tajins, hookahs and various toys, but all of them are intended exclusively for tourists.
Gomo is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002. Homo landed from the face of the earth nava lava from the volcano Niyragonga. She buried the vast majority of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Gomo is safe enough to go beyond it, it is worth conducting a small investigation to see if the fighting is underway at some point in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city plays the role of the base for climbing the volcano Niiragonga. Very cheap services are also offered here for fans of mountain observation gorillas — it is difficult to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To travel around Gomu, you can take a boda-boda (motocycletic taxi). The standard (local) price per short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative inaccessibility of Tambuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant exotic sites.
Despite the reputation of the tourist attraction and the presence of the airport, today Timbuctu is a city in which poverty reigns.
In 1990 because of the threat from the sands of the desert, he was included in the list of objects of world heritage, which is in danger.
Henry Luis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city in the program of the PBS channel "Miracles of the African Continent".
Compared to other cities of the country, the city stands out even more, because it has more Arabic than the African style.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa. To the east, it borders Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and its southern border passes along the Krakodil River.
The area of the park is 19 500 km2. It has 14 ecozone, each of which has different animals and grows different plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered the most significant of the national parks of South Africa.
As in all national parks of the Republic of South Africa, the park daily is charged for admission and charging an environmental fee from visitors.
In addition, it may be profitable to purchase the so-called Wild Card — a season ticket that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all South Africa national parks.
The country's name is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is the center of attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which shape the architectural appearance of the city, are compared with a shiny column chart, and the waters of Victoria's harbor only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed if you leave the island and go to the nearby front of the Kaloon waterfront.
A significant part of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on drained lands.
In the past, this place was captured by colonizers from the UK, so if you want to see with your own eyes the evidence of the colonial past of the country, then you need to start from here.
The Sundranban Forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast deep into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO has declared a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarban National Park" is the part of the forest that is located in India.
Not only the mangrove swamps are called forests, these are some of the last deaf jungles that once covered the Gangl plain and still preserved.
The sundarbanb covers an area of 3850 km2, of which reservoirs or swamps cover about one-third.
The Sundarban Forest has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and currently, according to the data, 400 royal Bengali tigers and about 30 000 spotted deer are in the region.
From the interdistrict bus station (which is behind the river) buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is located in the Bumtang area).
