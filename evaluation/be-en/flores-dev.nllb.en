In two decades, China's GDP may exceed that of the United States.
The fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane season in 2010 is Tropical Storm Daniel, which originated in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum wind speed during a storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is 40 mph (64 km/h).
According to forecasts by scientists at the National Hurricane Center, Daniel will be ranked as a hurricane on Wednesday.
It is still difficult to estimate the potential impact of the storm on the United States and the Caribbean, as it is far from the ground.

According to the plague sufferer, Francisc Koval, one of the whistles finally failed to hold up, and people began to walk out through the window.
Stars emit heat and light thanks to energy, which is produced when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused), resulting in heavier elements.
Currently, scientists are working on a reactor that would be capable of generating energy in a similar way.
But this is a very difficult task, and it will take many years before the operational thermonuclear synthesis reactors are built.
Due to the surface tension, the steel needle can float on the surface of the water.
Surface tensions arise because the water molecules on its surface are strongly attracted to each other, and the force of attraction between them is greater than the tensile force between the air molecules above.
The molecules of the fluid form an invisible skin on its surface, which allows things like a needle to stay afloat.
On modern ice skates, the canyon has a double-edged stern with a flat square between the edges, which ensures better contact with the ice, even if the ice skates are at an angle.
The lower part of the blade is slightly bent, so when the blade is tilted, its edge is also bent, which touches the ice.
With this, the figure skater performs a turn, while when the skates are tilted to the right, the figure skater turns to the right, and when the skates are tilted to the left, he turns to the left.
To restore the previous energy level, they need to get rid of the excess energy from light.
For this purpose, they emit a tiny particle of light called photon.
The scientific name of this process is   induced emission of radiation, since bright light stimulates atoms, there is emission of photons of light, and light  is one of the types of radiation.
On the mirror below you can see atoms that emit photons, but in fact, of course, the photons are much smaller than on the mirror.
The size of photons is even smaller than the size of the particles that make up atoms!
The candlelight filament burns after hundreds of hours of work and the lamp stops lighting.
In this case, the lamp needs to be replaced, and care must be taken when replacing it.
First of all, you need to turn off the light switch or turn off the cable.

The heart pumps blood and is the main organ of the circulatory system.
In the direction from the heart, blood travels through the vessels known as arteries, and in the direction to the heart through the vessels known as veins.
Even the very hard branches and roots (and not just the leaves) were not a problem for the teeth of the triceratops.
According to some scientists, the triceratops could have been consumed by parasites of the plant type, which were very common in the melatonin period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of spiky, sharp leaves.
Before eating a cannon, the triceratops could break down leaves with their powerful jaws.
At the same time, other scientists state that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs would eat them, even though nowadays the leaf or fruit can feed on poisonous leaves and other animals, such as the parrot (which is descended from dinosaurs).
How would I be affected by the gravity of Io?Your weight on the surface of Io would be less than on Earth.
A man weighing 200 pounds (or 90 kg) on Earth on Io would weigh about 36 pounds (or 16 kg).So it is understandable that gravity on Io affects things to a lesser extent.
Unlike the Earth, the Sun has no solid surface on which to stand, and is composed entirely of fire, gases and plasma.
The gas becomes more and more dispersed as it moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part of the Sun that we observe is the photosphere, or in translation, the shorter light.
In 1610, nearly three thousand years later, the telescope's observation of Venus allowed the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei to see that it, like the Moon, has phases.
Only the side of Venus (or Moon) that is turned toward the Sun is illuminated, which is the reason for the phase change.The phases of Venus served as proof of the Copernican theory, which claimed that planets orbit around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, astronomer from England, Jeremiah Horace, was observing the transit of Venus through the Sun's disk.
After the conquest of the Danish kingdom, England was at peace for a long time.
However, in 991 Ethelred was opposed by a Viking fleet, which only Guthrum's fleet a hundred years earlier could match in size.

The Hangul is the only alphabet in the world that was specially developed and used by many people every day, and it appeared in 1444, when the country was ruled by King Sejong (1418-1450)
Sebe-jeon, one of the most respected figures of the royal blood, was the fourth van of the Chazon dynasty.
He first gave the alphabet Hangil the name Hunmin Yongheim.This means in translation suitable sounds to teach people.
There are many theories about how and where Sanskrit came from, one of which claims that it was the native language of the Aryans who migrated to India from the west.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, comparable to the Latin that was common in Europe earlier.
The earliest known books were written in Sanskrit, and after the Upanishads were compiled, the Sanskrit simply disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a rich and very complex language, on the basis of which a number of modern Indian dialects have emerged, similar to how European languages, such as Spanish and French, evolved from Latin.
After the Battle of France ended, Germany began preparations to invade Britain.
Germany carried out an attack codenamed Operation Sea Cat, most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, which weakened the army considerably.
But nevertheless the Royal Navy was far more powerful than the German Navy (which in German is called Krigsmarinen): it could destroy any attacking fleet heading across the English Channel.
At the same time, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the probable routes of attack, because admirals were wary of being torpedoed by German air forces.
Let us first explain the plans of Italy, a country that was the younger brother of Japan and Germany.
Although four new ships had been built before the war began, her army and navy were weaker.
African countries were Italy's main target, requiring a launch pad to capture those countries, from which troops could cross the Mediterranean and attack Africa.
To this end, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and the Italian liners had to do nothing else.
Now that Japan is in the hands of the British, Japan was an island nation, just like the United Kingdom.
Submarines are ships that have been specially designed to navigate underwater and can stay underwater for long periods of time.
Submarines were used during both World Wars I and II, and at the time they moved very slowly, and their range was quite small.
When the war began, they were floating mostly on the sea surface, but as radar improvements and accuracy increased, submarines had to descend underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines were called U-be-but.The Germans had excellent navigational and navigational skills.
After the war, Germany was not allowed to have many submarines because of their successful use.
One of the most famous pharaohs of ancient Egypt today is Pharaoh Tutankhamun, sometimes called Pharaoh Tutbe or Pharaoh-boy.
Interestingly, it was not included in the ancient lists of kings, as it was considered to be of little importance.
At the same time, after his burial site was discovered in 1922, he became famous, and while many of the tombs in the past were plundered, his tomb remained almost intact.
Most of the artifacts that were buried alongside the Tutankhamun are well preserved, among them thousands of artifacts made of rare stones and precious metals.
With the invention of wheels with spikes, Assyrian chariots became lighter, faster, and more capable of carrying both soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their lethal arrows smoothly pierced the battleships of the warrior army.The horse first appeared in the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
Cavalry was a horse-riding army, the Assyrian cavalry was fighting, sitting straight on the back of its horses, because the saddle had not yet been invented at that time.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists, and perhaps the legendary blind poet, who created two masterpieces of Greek literature Iliadu and Adisieu, is the most famous representative of this culture.
Even today, popular playwrights remain Sophocles and Aristophanes, whose plays are among the treasures of world literature.
The mathematician Pythagoras is also one of the most famous Greek originators, and was praised mainly for his legendary theorem about the co-relationships of the sides of a right triangle.
There are various opinions as to how many people speak Hindi, and according to various estimates, it ranks among the top languages in the world (between second and fourth) in terms of number of speakers.
There are different estimates of the number of speakers of this language, depending on whether the related dialects are taken into account.
The total number of speakers of this language in the world is estimated at between 340 and 500 million, and an additional 800 million people may understand it.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but different spelling; speakers of both languages in everyday conversations usually understand each other.
Somewhere in the 15th century Germany had a considerable influence on the culture of northern Estonia.
German monks intended to bring the native people closer to God, and it was through them that the Estonian literary language emerged.
It was based on the German alphabet, to which the letter Õ/õ was added.
Many words borrowed from German have been merged over time into one whole, thus beginning the Age of Enlightenment.
The heir to the throne would have traditionally joined the army immediately after graduating from school.
However, at Trinity College, Cambridge, Charles went on to pursue higher education, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then history, and graduated 2:2 (the lowest second-class degree).

About 3% of the country's territory is in the European part of Turkey (east Thrace or Rumellia in the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey's length is over 1600 km (or 1000 miles), and its width is about 800 km (or 500 miles).
Turkey (including the Azores) occupies 783,562 square kilometres (or 300,948 square miles) of such an area.In Southwest Asia, 755,688 square kilometres (or 291,773 square miles) of the above-mentioned number, and in Europe, 23,764 square kilometres (or 9,174 square miles) are covered.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world by area, almost the size of France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg only gained its independence in 1839, despite its long history.
The modern regions of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but were transferred to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always strived to remain neutral, but during the First and Second World Wars it was under German occupation.
Luxembourg in 1957 became one of the original founding members of the association, which today is known as the European Union.
Drug'el Dzong is a Buddhist monastery and the ruins of a fortress located in the upper part of the district of Paro (more precisely, in the village of Fundy).
Jabdrung Ngwang Namgyel is believed to have built the fortress in 1649 to perpetuate his own victory over the Tibetan-Mongol armies.
As a result of the fire in 1951 from Drukgel-Djongbe, only a few relics remain, among which was the image of Shabbdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire the fortress was preserved and taken under care, and even today it is still considered one of the most beautiful places in Bhutan.
Cambodia during the 18th century was sandwiched between Thailand and Vietnam, two powerful neighbors.
During the 18th century Cambodia was repeatedly invaded by the Thais, who completely destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
At the turn of the 18th century, Vietnamese invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and those who are are, mostly, work in the economic sector.
The service sector employs two-thirds of the working Venezuelans, almost a quarter of whom work in industry and a fifth of whom work in agriculture.
Although only one percent of Venezuela's population is employed in the oil sector, the oil industry is important to the country, as it is the last net exporter of oil.
When the country had just gained independence, the experience and professionalism of the staff of the Singapore Botanical Garden helped turn the island into a tropical garden city.

To learn how to create an interactive environment, you need to have both the relevant traditional skills and those acquired during interactive activities (including making recordings, editing and editing audio and video, writing short stories, etc.).
Interactive modeling requires you to revise your presentations on preparing materials for the media and learn nonlinear thinking.
For the purposes of interactive design, it is necessary that the components of the project not only combine, but also make sense individually.
Objects with variable focal lengths have a specific lack of focus complexity and the number of lens elements needed to reach a certain range of focal lengths is much higher than simple objects.
The problem is disappearing as lens manufacturers are meeting increasingly high standards in their manufacturing.
Because of this quality of the photographs that could be taken with such zoom lenses, it was possible to compare the quality of the photographs to those made with fixed focal length lenses.
As a rule, the smaller maximum diaphragm (speed) of the lens is another shortcoming of zoom lenses.
For this reason, inexpensive zoom lenses are difficult to use without flashing, when there is little light.
The display-on-screen palace is one of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format.
The design of the main body of TVs is designed in such a way that it is enjoyed by as many people as possible.
That's why in a TV picture, the boundaries are always carved up, down and down.
This is done so that the viadris will be guaranteed to cover the screen completely.
Sadly, when you make a DVD, the edges of the video are likely to be shortened as well, so subtitles can only be seen partially if they are too close to the bottom of the screen.
The classical medieval castles always gave room for imagination  they gave rise to the image of knightly processions, banquets and forced the recollection of legends about King Arthur.
The sounds and smells of ancient battles are easily remembered, the sound of the drums almost ringing on the barrel and the fear rising from the underground prisons are felt, even if you are standing between millennia-old ruins.
But how much does our imagination relate to reality? why were castles built in general? how were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxlo Castle  typical for this period  is more fortified houses than real castles.
Hardly could the massive glass windows and the thin scenes of the castle have long deterred a decisive attack by the Nepriet.
When Lord Hastings began building it in the 1480s, the country was relatively peaceful, and only a small group of itinerant marauders had to be defended.
The balance of power was used as a tool by European countries to secure the national sovereignty of all European peoples.
The essence of the concept was that all European countries sought to prevent the consolidation of any one state, and as a result, national governments often joined different unions to maintain balance.
The First World War, the main problem of which was the relationship of powers, was the War of Spanish Succession.
This was a significant change, since no more European states had any reason to start religious wars.
As a result of a fire, committed by Gerastrath, on July 21, 356 BC, the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed.
If he believed in legend, his goal was to be famous at any cost, and the angry Ephesians announced that the name of Gerastratus would never be recorded in the annals.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned his name, which is why we know him today.On the night Alexander the Great was born, the temple of Artemis was destroyed.
Alexander the Great made a truly imperial gesture, offering to pay for the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was not accepted.The temple was restored in the 323rd century BC, after Alexander's death.
Your arm should be as relaxed as possible, make sure you still press the key correctly, and try to avoid unnecessary and unnecessary finger movements.
It is worth remembering that you do not need to press the key very hard to get a louder sound, as they do on the piano.
To get an extra volume of air while playing the accordion, it is necessary to press the harpsichord with greater pressure and speed.
Mysticism is the desire to connect with, identify with, or know the ultimate reality, deity, spiritual truth or God.
The goal of believers is to gain practical experience, develop spiritual vision, or an understanding of the essence of divine reality or the essence of deity.
Followers lead a certain lifestyle or engage in appropriate practices with the aim of enriching their own experience of this kind.
The difference between mysticism and other religious beliefs and cults is that in mysticism the main focus is on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially if this experience is peaceful, insightful, blessed, or even ecstatic in nature.
Sikhism is a religion that originated in the Indian subcontinent and emerged in the 15th century in the Punjab region as a result of the emergence of various sectarian groups within Hinduism.
Although Sikhs recognize Hindu roots and traditions of Sikhism, they still believe that their faith and Hinduism are separate religions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means shlea guru.In all Indian religions the concept of guru is central and has great importance, however in Sikhism it has become so important that it is a major component of the Sikh beliefs.
The founder of the religion in the 15th century was Guru Nanak (1469~1539), followed by nine other gurus in a row.
However, in June 1956, when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test.
And although the Khrushchev regime eventually restored order in the country with the help of tanks, it nevertheless went through some economic concessions and agreed to appoint popular Wladyslaw Gamulk as the new prime minister.
The Indian civilization is a civilization of the Bronze Age.The area of inhabitation of the civilization mentioned above was in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent.The above-mentioned area referred to a significant part of the territory of modern-day Pakistan, as well as separate regions in northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern India.
The civilization reached its peak in the Indus River basin, hence its name.
Given that this civilization also existed in the dried-up Sarawasati river basins, some scholars suggest that it should be correctly called the Indo-Sarawasati civilization, while others call it the Harp civilization after the city of Harpa, whose first excavations began in the 1920s.
Advances in medicine were greatly influenced by the fact that the Roman Empire was a military state.
The emperor Augustus was the first to recruit physicians for service, and even established the first Roman medical corps to provide medical assistance to those who were wounded in future battles.
Surgeons are known for all sorts of pain relievers, including morphine, which is obtained from maca seed extract, and scapulamin, which is obtained from the extract of the blaca seed.
To save gangrene patients, they learned to perform amputations, and to stop bleeding, to apply gums and blood pressure equipment.
The Roman Empire had made great advances in medicine over several centuries, and we owe much of the knowledge we possess today to it.
Simple folding is a style of folding in which only one folding can be made per take.More complex folds, such as a reverse folding, are not allowed.At the same time, all of them are characterized by simple placement.
This technique was developed in the 1970s by John Smith, who sought to make lessons easier for inexperienced origamiists or people with limited motor skills.
Children at a fairly young age develop racial awareness and racial stereotypes emerge that shape type of behavior.
Children, for example, who identify themselves with such a racial minority, whose representatives, according to the stereotype, are poorly educated in school, as soon as they learn about this racial stereotype, usually start to study poorly in school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million registered profiles.
The above websites have gained great popularity, mainly in the educational environment.
These websites have a number of positive features, including the ability to easily configure a class page with blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be accessed by entering only one web address, so that students who have difficulty using a keyboard or who have spelling problems can quickly memorize and type it.
It can be customized to be easy to read and can also be colored with a color scheme.
Attention deficit disorder is a neurological syndrome whose three classic manifestations are pathological distraction, impulsivity, and excessive energy (or hyperactivity)
It is a cognitive disorder, not an inability to learn; it affects 35 percent of children, or about 2 million of all children in America.
Children with attention deficit disorder have difficulty concentrating, for example, on schoolwork, but they are able to concentrate on things they like, such as favorite cartoons, games, or writing without stopping.
Since the brains of these children cannot be stimulated by conventional methods, they engage in risky behavior, give way to fights and defy authorities, leading to a host of problems.
Attention deficit disorder affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why those who suffer from ADHD act and write accordingly, or why they have a different level of maturity.
The basic rate of knowledge acquisition has changed as a result of the aforementioned change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn.
In the context of individual memory tests, there was no longer any compulsion to memorize, but more attention was paid to the ability to remember text.
In fact, the approach to learning and knowledge expansion changed significantly during the Age of Enlightenment.
Hummingbirds no longer use their hands to move, carry weight, and bark on trees, unlike other primates.
The arms and legs of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, suggesting that when walking with the fingers pointed to the feet, the hands were used to carry the weight.
A man's arm is not as long as a foot, and the phalanges on it are more straight.
The above mentioned transition in the hands of a worker from moving objects to performing operations suggests that the fossil bones of the hands are between two and three million years old.
According to some people, the many artificial-induced dreams can often be very exhausting.
This phenomenon is mainly explained by the fact that in the case of awake dreams, the interval between the phases of rapid sleep increases.
If you have fewer phases of rapid sleep during the night, the state in which you actually sleep and your body recovers becomes insufficiently frequent, which is a problem.
It's no less exhausting than waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch something on TV.
The effect is influenced by the frequency with which your brain tries to see the nightly dreams.
Almost from the very beginning, the Italian cause in North Africa was not considered.After war was declared by Italy on 10 June 1940, within a week, the British 11th Hussars captured the Libyan Fort Capuccio.
The British had planned an ambush east of Bardia and captured General Lastuci, who was the commander of the engineering forces of the Italian tenth army.
The governor-general of Libya and the obvious successor of Mussolini, Marshal Ital Balbo, was killed during the landing at Tobruk by shelling of his troops on June 28.
Modern fencing is practiced at many levels, including university students and professional athletes, and is part of the Olympic program.
In this sport, it is more like a duel: one wrestler competes with another.
Golf is a game in which players hit balls in the grooves using special clubs.
During a typical party, players pass eighteen moons, usually starting with the first and ending on the eighteenth moon on the field.
The winner is the golfer who needs to make the least number of strokes or kicks to get through the entire course.
The game takes place on a field with grass covered, and the grass is picked up by the caraway around the lawn, and this very place is called grín.
The most popular of tourism is probably leisure tourism: something that the vast majority of people associate with travel.
It is at this point that people are sent to rest and have fun in a place that has nothing to do with their daily lives.
Most often, tourists who want to relax and rest a bit visit standard places such as beaches, amusement parks and campsites.
If a person, while visiting a particular place, sets before himself the goal of studying its history and culture, then it is cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places and attractions of a particular country or pay special attention to only one region or area.
Observing everything that was happening, the colonists also provoked a backlash.
The 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Battalions were part of the Army, which provided for the strengthening of the forward positions, each with 200 men, commanded by Colonel John Stark and James Reid, who later became generals.
The people of Stark settled from the northern edge of the colonial positions along the barracks.
After the tide opened the way to the strait along the Mystic River on the northeast coast of the peninsula, they sparkly extended the strait, building a short stone wall that stretched and ended on a small beach at the water's edge.
At about 100 feet (30 meters) from the grid grid grid, Gridley or Stark set up a shell and ordered no one to shoot until regular troops passed through it.
Simultaneous squadron attacks from three different sides were part of the American plan.
To prevent reinforcements from being overwhelmed, General John Cavanaugh moved on to attack the British garrison at Bordentown.
After passing 700 Apache men across the canal to Trenton-Ferrry, General James Ewing seized the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevented the garrison from escaping.
The main strike group, consisting of 2,400 men, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups under the command of Sullivan and Green and attack the opponent before dawn.
When moving from a distance of a quarter mile to a half mile, speed loses its importance, but strength becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner per half-mile must not only have enough speed to run a distance of less than two minutes, but also maintain endurance and stamina in any danger.
The best preparation for the new racing season in winter is cross country cross country along with upper body exercise in the gym.
Proper nutrition alone does not guarantee high results, but it can significantly improve the overall health of young athletes.
Improve their performance, gain more enjoyment from sports, help athletes maintain a good energy balance, practice effective replenishment habits and understand various aspects of dietary supplementation.
Running over medium distances is relatively inexpensive compared to sports, but there are many misconceptions about the sporting equipment that must be used to compete.
Things can be bought when they are needed, but they do not predominantly affect the outcome or this effect will be almost negligible.
Athletes may prefer a product, even if it is not worth the price.
It can be considered that the atom is one of the fundamental building blocks, of which all matter is composed.
The atom is a rather complex object, according to the simplified Borovese model, centered on a nucleus, whose orbits orbit electrons, the latter somewhat resembling planets orbiting the Sun (see Figure 1.1.).
Two particles form the nucleus be protons and neutrons.
While neutrons have no charge, protons have a positive electric charge, while electrons have a negative electric charge.
First, you need to carefully examine the scene to make sure your safety, and only then can you examine the victim.
When approaching a victim, you need to pay attention to its layout and the presence of suspicious signals.
If you get injured while providing assistance, it can only make things more difficult.
The results of the study determined that fear, depression and catastrophe were a link between pain and disability in patients suffering from pain in the lower back.
Not depression and fear, but the extreme catastrophe and its consequences, have led to regular weekly structured sessions on PA.
People who exercised regularly needed a lot of support in terms of negative perceptions of pain to learn to distinguish chronic pain from discomfort, which is caused by exercise.
The visual system or the ability to see is affected by the sensory organs of the visual system, or, in other words, the eyes.
There are a large number of different structures of the eye, which differ in their complexity, which is motivated by the requirements of the body.
Different designs are characterized by different capabilities, varying degrees of sharpness and sensitivity to different wavelengths, and for the analysis of input data, they have different processing methods and different parameters to ensure optimal functioning.
Population is the aggregate of individuals of a particular species that exists within a particular geographic region.
If all members of a population have the same phenotypic characteristics, they are called manamorphic.
Members of a population are polymorphic if they exhibit different variations of a particular trait.
Similarly, the migration and nesting of the ant colonies takes place in different phases.
During their hunting, the migratory ants move at night, and during the day they stop for rest.
The caching phase in the colony begins when the available food supply decreases, during which the colony makes time nests and changes them daily.
Each of these rallies or marches lasts about 17 days.
The word itself derives from the Latin cella, meaning "little room", which was first introduced and applied by microscopists who studied the structure of the woody crust.
A cell is the basic element of all living things, and all of them are made up of one cell or more.
For the study of life, cells are of such basic and great importance that they are often called the building blocks of life.
By sending nerve impulses throughout the body, the nervous system provides seamless blood circulation and thus maintains homeostasis.
Neural impulses help the body to guard against any possible threat because they are very quickly transmitted throughout the body.
Compared to other strong tornadoes, tornadoes strike on a small area, yet they are capable of literally destroying everything in their path.
Tornadoes tear down trees with roots, tear down shields and advertising shields from buildings, and blow up cars.Two hundred of the most destructive tornadoes can stain in over three hours.
Wind speeds in these terrible storms reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Lenses have been manufactured and used by humans for thousands of years.
However, the first full-powered telescopes did not appear in Europe until the 16th century.
Such telescopes used two lenses to allow for the approach, magnification and viewing of distant objects.
Humanity will always be selfish and selfish, and the nature of cooperation is that if the majority benefits from something, then in the short term, it is always possible to get more benefits if they act exclusively and in their own interests.
It remains only to hope that most people will realize that cooperation is the best option in the long run.
Many dream that there will be a day when humans will be able to travel to other stars and explore other worlds, some wonder what is there, some believe in aliens or life on other planets.
However, if this really happens, it is probably not too soon, because the stars are so far apart that even between them there are trillions of miles.
Perhaps your great-grandchildren will one day reflect on their ancient ancestors, standing somewhere on the top of an alien world?
Animals are a collection of trillions of cells that feed on various substances that are digested inside them, and most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains (though not all; for example, jellyfish do not have one).
Animals can be found in any corner of the planet, digging in the ground, swimming in the mud, and flying in the air.
A cell is the smallest functional and structural unit of any living organism.
The word cell is derived from the Latin word cella, meaning small room.
You will see that living things are made up of small squares or balls if you try to look at them under a microscope.
Using a microscope, Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small squares in the crust.
Hook was the first person to see dead cells.
Compounds and elements are capable of moving from one state to another without change.
Both nitrogen gas and liquid nitrogen have the same properties, the liquid is denser, but these are the same molecules.
Another example is water, which as a chemical compound contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Even when it is converted to a gas-like, brittle or solid state, it retains the same molecular structure.
Its chemical state remains unchanged, even when the physical state changes.
Time is always around us and influences all our actions, yet it is difficult to understand.
Religious, philosophical and scientific practitioners have studied time for thousands of years.
According to our senses, time be is a series of events that pass through the present into the past from the future.
In addition, time  is the means by which we compare the length of events.
By observing the repetition of a cyclical event, you can independently mark the passage of time.
In our time, computers can be used to process photos and videos.
Complex animation, which is increasingly used in television and movies, is created using computers.
Complex computers are often used when recording music to process and mix sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the idea was that the Moors were the first inhabitants of New Zealand, hunting large birds known as moas.
Later, a theory emerged that the Maori people sailed from the Great Plains of Polynesia, displaced the Maori people from New Zealand, and established an agrarian society on that land.
However, if new data are believed, the mariours were a group of small-scale, land-locked tribes who sailed to the Chatham Islands from New Zealand and developed their own unique peaceful culture.
Another tribe inhabited the Chatham Islands, the Mahars from New Zealand, who settled here.
The Mariooribe, as they called themselves, had several clashes, but at the end the marioors were destroyed.
People who have been involved in this work for decades have helped us better understand our own interests and tendencies while at the same time being honest about the difficult moments and even the failures.
By listening to people's stories about themselves, their families, and the organizations they work for, we gained valuable information about the past and about some people who have led to changes in organizational culture for better or worse.
Understanding culture doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with understanding history, but it does help people understand what place they occupy in the history of an organization.
In the process of evaluating successes and analyzing failures, participants, both individually and collectively, gain a deeper understanding of the organization's values, mission and driving forces.
In this case, people were open to changes and new directions of activity of the local church, as they recalled the previous entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes.
Previous success stories helped reduce fear of change and created positive forums for future change.
Generalizing thinking is a method of solving problems and problems in which the search for solutions is conducted in different fields and using different ideas.
This type of thinking is characterized by speed, logic, accuracy, fact recognition, reuse of existing methods and data collection.
The most important feature of this type of thinking is that there can only be one correct answer.There are only two answers  right and wrong.
This type of thinking is most often found in people whose sphere of activity is related to certain scientific or typical processes or procedures.
Logical thinking is characteristic of people with this type of thinking, they can memorize irregularities, solve problems and conduct scientific research.
Of course, humans have been more successful in reading the minds of others than other species.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the feelings, intentions, hopes, knowledge and desires of other people.
The most important of these abilities is understanding the intentions of others, as it allows us to rule out any potential ambiguities in the event of physical actions.
So, if you have to watch someone break a car's spindle, you are likely to conclude that this person is trying to steal someone's car.
However, if he lost the keys to his own car and tried to get into his own car, your guess would not be true.
MRI is a technology underpinning the physical phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that was discovered by Felix Bloch (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University) in the 1930s.
The magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms during this resonance to generate faint radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damandjian, a medical doctor, scientist and researcher, understood how magnetic resonance imaging could be used in medicine to diagnose diseases.
Four years later, the world's first patent in the field of MRI was issued.
Dr. Damadzyan completed the construction of the first full-body MRI scanner in 1977.This scanner was given the nickname "Nazlomny" by the scientist.
In asynchronous interactions, more time is needed to think and react.
This enables students to work at their own pace, as well as control the speed at which academic information is received and processed.
In addition, this method involves fewer time constraints, and allows for flexible scheduling (Bremer, 1998)
Thanks to the Internet and the World Wide Web, learners can search or receive information at any time.
Also, instead of waiting for the next in-person meeting, students can ask teachers questions at any time and in most cases they get a pretty quick answer.
The postmodernist approach to acquiring new knowledge implies freedom from absolute principles, prohibitions and values.
In fact, there is a great deal to learn, and learning happens through experience between existing knowledge and learners.
This is confirmed by our experience of interacting with all educational television shows in the category of "self-help" and information programs.
How often do we watch TV shows where we talk about some process or experience, in which we will never participate and knowledge about which we will never need.
We will hardly ever go to Peru to study ancient ruins or rebuild a neighborhood house.
Thanks to underwater cable and satellite communications from Europe, 93% of the population of Greenland has access to the Internet.
Most often, your hotel or hostel (if you stay in a guest house or private home) will have Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and an Internet cafe or place with Wi-Fi is available in all settlements.
As noted earlier, although the word эскимос remains acceptable in the United States, many Arctic peoples outside the United States (especially in Canada) consider it demeaning.
Although the aforementioned word is used among the indigenous people of Greenland, it is not welcomed by foreigners.
In Canada, the indigenous people of Greenland call themselves Inuit, and in Greenland be калалек (correspondingly, in plural калаліт).This means inhabitant of Greenland or grandland.
Crime and hostility towards foreigners are generally a phenomenon that is virtually uncommon in Greenland, where dangerous criminal districts are not even in the city.
The only real danger that an unprepared person may face is cold weather.
If you plan to visit Greenland in the cold season, you need to bring enough warm clothing (because the further north you go, the colder it will be).
Because summer days are very long, sleep deprivation and other health problems can cause problems.
In the summer, we should also remember the Northern Camels, who, although not carriers of disease, can be very aggressive.
San Francisco's economy is based on the fact that the city is a popular tourist destination with world-class attractions, but at the same time it is diversified.

Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, located near Botswana, on the border with Livingston, Zambia.
The city is located in close proximity to the main attraction  waterfalls.In addition, this popular tourist destination offers both sightseeing enthusiasts and adventure seekers many opportunities to stay here longer.
From November to March, that is, during the rainy season, the water volume increases, and the waterfall itself looks more spectacular.
If you walk across a bridge or one of the trails that announce a waterfall, you must be wet.
At the same time, it is precisely because of such a huge amount of water that it will be difficult for you to see the waterfall itself, as all this waterfall will cover it!
Tutankhamun's Tomb (KV62).KV62 is perhaps the most famous burial place in the valley, where in 1922 Howard Carter found the nearly intact tomb of the young king.
Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth a visit, unlike most other royal tombs, which are much smaller and decorated rather modestly.
All those who want to see the damage done by the mummy and the attempt to get it out of the tomb will be disappointed, for you can only see the head and shoulders of Pharaoh.
The tomb no longer has Cossack treasures  they were transferred to the Cairo Museum of Egyptian Culture.
Visitors are better off spending time somewhere else, if it's limited at their place.
12 km southwest of the city of Siemreapu is the temple of Phnom-Crom.This temple building on top of the hill appeared in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yashovarman.

This means that you are on a ship that best suits your personal interests and (or) limitations.
Northern Chile was under the control of the Incas until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, when central and southern Chile were inhabited by indigenous Araucans (Mapuche).
In addition, the Mapuche were one of the last independent groups of Native Americans not completely absorbed by Spanish-speaking rule, only after Chile gained independence.
A decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818, despite the fact that Chile had declared independence in 1810 (against the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain for several years remained without a functioning central government).
The Dominican Republic (known in Spanish as the Dominican Republic) is part of the Caribbean, and together with Haiti, it is located on the island of Espanyol, occupying the eastern part of the latter.
The country not only boasts white sandy beaches and mountainous scenery, but also contains the oldest European city on the American continent, which today is part of Santa Domingo.
Originally the island was inhabited by the Taina and Caribbean peoples, the language of the Caribs who arrived on the island about 10,000 years ago was called Arawak.
The Spanish conquistadors greatly reduced the number of Taina people in the few years that followed the arrival of European explorers.
According to the data brought by Frey Bartalome de las Casas in his book Indian Daughter, Spanish conquistadors from 1492 to 1498 destroyed about 100,000 secrets.
It was built as an atrium for a 17th-century women's monastery, where the Temple de San Diego is the only building that has survived to our time.

The Cook Islands is an island country in the territory of Polynesia, located in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean and has the status of a self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand.
The area of this archipelago, which includes 15 islands, exceeds 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
These islands are often perceived as overturned Hawaiian because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii.
Although these islands are smaller in size, they remind some older tourists of Hawaii from the time when they were not yet part of the United States and had no huge hotels and other facilities.
There are no towns on the Cook Islands, but they are composed of 15 different islands, the largest of which are Raratonga and Aituka.
In our time in developed countries, hotel services in the category of "nights and breakfasts" in the luxury segment have become truly art.

The vast majority of temples hold a festival every year, beginning at the end of November and ending at mid-May.Depending on the calendar of events of each temple, the time of this festival may vary.
The temple feasts are usually held as part of the temple calendar, the birthday of the supreme god, or as part of another major event related to the temple.
It is very interesting to observe temple saints in Kerala, usually a procession of ornate elephants, a temple orchestra and other ceremonies and celebrations.
The world's largest international arts and sciences festival is the World Fair (more commonly known as the World's Fair or simply the Expo).
The participating countries organize educational and artistic exhibitions at national pavilions to showcase global issues or the history and culture of their homeland.
International gardening exhibitions are essentially specialized events, where botanical gardens, flower windows and exhibits are presented and everything that is related to the plant world in some way or another is presented.
Although in theory they can be held every year (provided that the venues are different countries), in practice this is not the case.
Typically, the duration of such events is three to six months, and the terrain for holding them must be at least 50 hectares.
Many film formats have been used for many years, the most common being standard 35mm film (for negatives 36 x 24mm).
Such a film can usually be purchased without any problems if it runs out suddenly, and its separation capacity approximately corresponds to the characteristics of modern digital single-lens reflex (DSLR).
The 6 x 6 cm, or more accurately, the negative 56 x 56 mm, format is used by some film cameras.
The resulting separation is almost four times greater than the same in negative 35 mm (3136 mm2 compared to 864 mm2).
One of the most challenging subjects of photography for a photographer is the wild nature, which requires a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
People often take wildlife photographs as a proper one, but as with regular photography, it's better to see once than to hear a hundred times.
In fact, to photograph living nature, you need a long telephoto lens, and if you want to photograph magical birds or various small creatures, you don't need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are rare, and parks may have certain rules regarding commercial photography.
Wild animals can be aggressive or secretive, and the streets can be too hot or too cold, and the environment can be rough and unfriendly.
The total number of languages in the world exceeds 5,000, and more than twenty of them have 50 or more million speakers.
In addition, in many cases written words are easier to understand than spoken ones, and this is especially true for addresses, as they are often difficult to pronounce intelligently.
In many countries, the English language is spoken by the entire population, while in many others, especially among young people, it is possible to count on having some English.

If you take a tablet or laptop with you when you travel, save a copy to the memory of the device or to a disk (which you could use in the absence of the Internet).
Copies of the agreement or policy can also be left to relatives, companions or friends in their home country who are willing to help.
American lazybees (also called simply lazybees) are essentially non-aggressive, however, if they sense a threat, they will defend themselves.
People may not see the potential danger posed by the salmon, in which case they may get too close to the animal and thus expose themselves to risk.
Alcohol has a different effect on everyone, so it is very important to know your own limits.
In the long run, excessive alcohol use can lead to liver damage and even blindness and death.If you consume counterfeit alcohol, the potential risk increases.
