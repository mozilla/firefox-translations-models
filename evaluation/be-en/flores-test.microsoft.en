Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that is not normally obtained by studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or red-yellow hue on the back.
This discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the fact that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk, rachis, but have other feather traits such as antennae and beards, the researchers concluded that rachis was probably a late evolutionary change compared to the other traits.
Judging by the structure of the feather, we can conclude that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate the temperature or draw attention to itself. Researchers assumed that even despite the fact that it was the tail of a young dinosaur, on the sample you can see not the fluff of a bird, but adult plumage.
Researchers suggest that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the plumage of an adult animal can be seen in the specimen, and not the fluff of a chick.

The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters locked themselves in a booth to take out a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the respective candidate and put it in an envelope.
After the identification of the voter by officials, the latter dips the envelope into the ballot box and puts his signature on the voter list.
All this procedure is carried out in strict accordance with the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent.

To witness each part of the process, candidates can send their representatives. In the evening, following certain procedures, volunteers, who are under strict control, count the votes.

Both cyanic acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after consuming contaminated food.
Researchers from the university said that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.
By adding melanin and cyanic acid to the cat's urine, the researchers observed the formation of crystals.
According to the results of infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to those found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you understand it or not, but most of the goods delivered to this country from Central America are not subject to duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were taxed.
I thought it was pointless and unfair.
I always tell people that you treat us the same way we treat you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, has approved a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of video games to minors where there is a large amount of violence.

Schneider testified from his home country via video link, while he was stationed at a U.S. Navy base.
In addition to the competition, Carpaneda took part in the championship in two more individual races.
She first took part in the slalom, where she withdrew from the distance in the first race. Thirty-six of the 116 participants showed the same result.
During her performance in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position. Her time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place taken by Austria's Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place taken by Jongi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh Police.

He was admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Cambridge to Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Adekoya has since been at Edinburgh Sheriff's Court after being accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting arraignment and trial while in custody. But, given that her photos have been published in many places, any eyewitness testimony can be questioned.
In other regions of the UK, this is an extended practice, however in Scotland the justice system works differently – the courts believe that the publication of photographs could potentially prove harmful.
"It seems that journalists are going down a dangerous path when they publish photos and so on of suspects", observes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, which is empowered to prosecute the accused, told reporters that at least until an indictment is filed, no further comment can be obtained.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in such a way as to preserve the borders that existed before the outbreak of the 1967 war in the Middle East.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document are the questions of the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the Valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees only to five years.
Shooters who took part in the additional program to control the spread of animals had to be under the close supervision of rangers, because the program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Sport Shooters Association of Australia, Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is being implemented under the auspices of the Sport Shooters Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the conservation and heritage of the park, said the four shooters selected to conduct the first shooter operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and provided appropriate training with them.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by the new Provisional Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Marteya in four years.
The presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Interim Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the large anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelly responded with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and violent, was the absence of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported. This led to six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MEGP), they had information about the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced a report from Apple of 34 new cases of overheating, which it described as "frivolous".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report to a later date "worthy of sincere regret".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
Officials with the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of destruction or accidents in the country.
In addition, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of disaster.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital Manila and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have been killed so far.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
A lady in her years needed to go to the toilet, so the photographers stayed hostage instead of her. Mendoza was arrested.
Liggins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He trained to be an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he began studying the problem of premature birth in his spare time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the lungs of the embryo.
According to a report by the Xinhua news agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of two months. It's quite original, just like herself. "Luna was a strong woman," Tony Dreamer said.
Dustin "Goldust" Rannels remarked, "That moon was just as weird as I was... And maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her. I want to believe that she is in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people that was conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting prime minister, said that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This view is shared by 34 percent of the respondents. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 per cent of those surveyed who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 per cent who, on the contrary, are of the opinion that this should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt: he has complained a lot about his health.
He didn't have the opportunity to take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
On Jan. 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, found the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people by early February using different hardware and programs, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is believed that comets could bring to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of life support, but also water.
Given that comets collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of formation of planets, primarily Earth.
Earlier this year, the 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed into law a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
"Political chatter and stupidity" he christened these rumors.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that thanks to the NextGen system, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radars, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more correct information.
The number of vehicles is not increasing and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition, there is no car parking on the ground level, nor will there be intercept parking lots.
The likelihood of being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's fans increased, as it may well be that there were not enough vehicles.
The formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands is described in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species took place in only two generations, although it was previously believed that this process takes much more time. The emergence of the new species was made possible by the crossing of the endemic earth yur (Geospiza fortes) with the non-native cactus earth yurt (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be made in different shapes. It can be written into thin letters.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which then has no problem twisting and braiding. You can also write it down or write it down.
It can be made very thin and attached to a second metal. It could be so subtle that from time to time it was used to decorate illustrations drawn in books – the so-called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a chemical. You can make your own acid-base indicator from the juice of red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level in the test chemical is determined on the basis of the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as you know, the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in a circle until they are combined into a single whole, and then use wet hands to make a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates an amazing feeling. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mahenjo Dara could be found with a flush toilet attached to a complex sewage system.
In the houses of Greek cities in Crete and Santarina, which belong to the Minoan period, the remains of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, in which women and men were together.
You're using a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of miles away from you.
In space, the satellite receives a call, and then almost instantly reflects it back.
The rocket was used to send a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space, because due to the influence of the Earth's atmosphere, light is refracted and the image is distorted.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a huge rocket more than 100 feet high is needed.
The world has changed the world in an incredible way. Getting it easier and faster is the biggest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized — they hunt both rabbits and antelope with deer.
On top of that, many small cats (including free-range pets) catch and eat more abundant small prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e. It has its own function, so it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most sociable cats, living in large packs known as prides.
A pride can include up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is very similar. The latter can behave strongly resembling lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to prey.
A tiger is able to climb (but not as well), jump long distances, swim and pull with a force five times stronger than a strong person, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars (genus panther). No other cats, except for these four, can roar.
The roar of a tiger is more like a fairy tale consisting of sharp and loud words than the full-sounding roar of a lion.
Acelottes are used as food for small animals. If possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes and birds. Almost all of the animals he hunts are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that acelottes chase and find prey by smell, sniffing traces on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see well in the dark and move very confidently. Acelots hunt, merging with the environment and attacking their prey from hiding.
When a small group of living things (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they come (say, when moving across a river or mountain range, or if such living things migrate to a new island, so that it will be quite difficult for them to go back), they often find themselves in an environment that is very different from where they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor itself, the new population will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals look less and less like the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one will think of attributing them to the same species.
This process is what we call speciesization, which actually means the emergence of new species. Evolution is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe. In addition, they use carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants "cook" their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We eat mostly plants. Animals wouldn't survive without plants.
For their time, Masaurs were supercarnivores, so they were not afraid of anything or anyone except other Masosaurs.
More than 70 razor-sharp teeth flaunted on his long jaws, and there was another extra row at the top of his mouth. This meant that he could not be saved.
It is not known for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. The diet of the Masaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other Masaurs. It is likely that they may also be able to eat representatives of their own species.
He was always on the edge of everything that fell into the water. His toe was not worth even such a giant as Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Although the food was not surprising to us, the individual dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them are wild animals, peacocks, snails and one of the rodents known as the dormouse.
Another difference was that when the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets at which they ate and rested at the same time.
The composition of dishes prepared in ancient Rome could not include products that came to Europe from America or Asia later.
They didn't have potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa. It should be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to ask for a turkey.
For each of their gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered their home.
Believers offered sacrifices to their deities, and priests tried to meet their needs, holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own courtyard and sanctuary, where only priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers were erected, similar to pyramids. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not matter much.
For the most part, the life of the Jewish family was spent in the fresh air.
The women were cooking outside. The shops were just open counters facing the streets. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was of great value.
Greenland was not densely populated. If the Norse sagas are to be believed, Erik the Redhead was expelled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he called the "Green Land".
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie The Nation's Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Although something is actually written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse, read: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The inverted record is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that a large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for preservation in its early days.
Therefore, it is possible that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the landings in Normandy and the subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate the north of France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was under the rule of the "Vichys". These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoons began, and the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and Free France forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people working together and living in society.
The above term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "civil". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, i.e., "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". All of this, in turn, says something about the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, uniform dissemination and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first established a weak central government under the Treaty of Thirteen States. Only the Congress was part of this government.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since the national executive and judiciary did not exist, it expected to enforce all laws with the support of government agencies, which were often not in the mood to cooperate.
In addition, he did not have the power to repeal the tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the Treaty of Confederation, the unanimous consent of all the states was required to make changes, and the states so did not take the central government seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, ranks second among the strongest teams in the world. In 2006, she won the World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, while Italians also take part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is home to nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Due to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in terms of geography because it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa" – meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive farming practices. The company hired Chinese workers to cultivate rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) conquered western and northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, under which Japan was given sovereignty over the island, and the latter ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
In order for tourists to get a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
So, the world's most popular photo format for still frames is the 35mm format. In the era of analogue photography, this format of film prevailed.
Such film is still produced today, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width and height is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
This may be a bit confusing, but in reality, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, it is believed that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) have the same or similar aspect ratios.
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple piece of advice that provides dynamism and at the same time maintains a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, then the best place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photo in the vertical and horizontal planes into the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For all the linguistic and cultural differences that have taken place, the Christian religion has united European countries for more than a thousand years.
Everyone, from the king to the common man, was under her all-pervading power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that this is why the money of the church exists.
For more than 1,000 years, the central authorities of the church were in Rome. Because of this concentration of power and money, many people wonder if this dogma is being fulfilled.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although it violated universally recognized international law, which over the past two centuries has been enshrined at the legislative level by several international agreements, has proven to be an effective strategy.
The UK has banned international waters from entering certain areas of the ocean. As a result, even neutral vessels were endangered.
Due to the fact that there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany considered that it would not be able to engage in unrestricted underwater warfare either.
Pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and countries during the 1920s.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he got a job at the Edison Company in New York.
Only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to designate different eras. At every stage of China's history, or in every family, there have been distinct dynasties.
In addition, the periods of reign of dynasties were divided by periods of disunited provinces, when instability reigned. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles who fought for the throne fought mercilessly among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died while fighting for the opportunity to take the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them are the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to the entire people.
In addition, various positions after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious made their way to the top.
In the army, the same thing happened, because if earlier military ranks were assigned, based on the estate, now - on the basis of skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in issues that went beyond worldly life. To meditate and meditate, he often visited a cave on Mount Noor (translated as "light"), which is known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual foundations of Mohammed.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if anyone knows about its existence. Inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can't see the beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that have been erected to commemorate the late Pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of Death in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, temples and tombs were dedicated to the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The sign denoting the movement of the bow upwards looks like a "V", and downwards looks like a parenthesis or square without an underside.
"Bow upward movement" means that you need to start moving from the end of the bow and lead it upwards, and "bow downward movement" means that you need to start at the pad (this is where your hand holds the bow) and lead the bow down.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more confident sound.
You can put your marks in pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols of the bow are there for a reason, but for a specific musical occasion, so they usually need to be kept.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Thérèse), and Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris. On the way, they were surrounded by a crowd - people in it whistled, shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage under the influence of the crowd of people.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the Queen, who was already terrified to death, with the head of a guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
In order to pay much of the costs and interest on bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the U.S. imperialists would be the super-profits brought by the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand who the Templars were, you need to understand what was the prerequisites for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The latter is believed to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" refers to a range of practical ideas, from pushing for the advancement of certain technologies or technical necessity to a clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in the realm of technology.
Two common ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself goes largely beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, has an inherent (rather than socially driven) impact on society.
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide highway network does not make economic sense. For this reason, new production methods are being developed, which will reduce the cost of owning a car.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare, which allow the treatment of various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
If we talk about the era of Romanticism, then people were strongly influenced by the geography of presence. Over time, the traditions and culture associated with it have emerged. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and position occupied by society.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gained prominence as the epicenter of luxury and maintained this status until almost 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status as the capital of luxury was palpable. This happened mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, among which were hot spices and silk, and they were valued much higher than offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of the fashion capital of Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
At first, the style of clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people as a result of the Crusades began to use buttons to fasten clothes, was one of the biggest events of that time.
In subsistence agriculture, such an amount of food is produced, which provides exclusively for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and usually organic system. It is based on the use of stored seeds inherent in a particular ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other not at all complicated methods. The goal of all this is to maximize productivity.
Historically, many farmers have been subsistence farmers. Many third world countries are still doing this.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views, who from the standpoint of social norms feel deprived of attention, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture can take place on the basis of various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of both.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic styles in clothing, mannerisms, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, the example of children who are not lucky enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various adversities or humiliations and insults, and whom adults did not socialize in childhood, is most often cited.
Such children are called "savages". Some "wild" children were imprisoned for a long time (usually treated this way by their own parents); In some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of the parents' reluctance to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or run away, feral children could have been severely bullied or traumatized.
Others seem to have been raised by animals; Some of them are said to have lived on their own.
If a child has been fully raised by animals, his behavior in almost everything (taking into account physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal caregiver: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new learning experiences. This could mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, the assistants are both a teacher and a small nurse in the Microsoft Office program.
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed in order to ask questions, make hints and explain procedures that are difficult for a student or listener to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children may be placed in foster care. It can be cruelty, neglect, and even coercion.
Children should not be allowed to grow up in an environment where they are not cared for, they are not raised or educated, but it still happens.
In our opinion, the foster care system is a safe area for such children.
It is expected that through our foster care system, the wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring caregivers, and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family must provide for all the needs of the child who were not met in the home from which he was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also interpersonal communication.
Due to the special characteristics of the Internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and satisfaction of the needs of the audience.
For example, it has been suggested that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are strong motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of 'personal involvement' and 'mature relationships' have also been identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as novel aspects of motivation in the study of audience reactions to internet sites.
Thanks to the video recording, important discoveries were made in the explanation of microexpressions - meaning the movements of facial muscles that last only a few milliseconds.
It has been argued, among other things, that the correct interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how brain-damaged people, without understanding the speech itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals — such as domestic dogs — may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The results of twentieth-century research suggest that there are two pools of genetic variation, namely, overt and hidden variation.
Under the influence of mutations, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of detected.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix variation in these two pools.
In the savannah, the available plant resources cannot meet the primates' need for amino acids if their digestive systems are similar to those of humans.
If they fail to do so, the consequences are serious. This includes malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins, which can be found in legumes and leaves. However, if they are not properly cooked, then the organisms of primates like us they are difficult to digest.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily digestible.
Apparently, it shouldn't be surprising to learn that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock, which will wake you up, but not completely.
If you find yourself shifting the clock in your sleep, try to put it at the other end of the room. So you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other biorhythm-based options, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed - this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The available life force is more positive the lower the voltage. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle in this way is our own negativity and tension.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of the Buddha, which has been supplemented by the love of Mahayana and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga and love for all mankind.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that in order to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a major part of the practice of Tibetan meditation. The visualization of various gods allows you to clear the energy channels, open the chakras and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the Soviet Union and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins, with former allies turning into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and the armies of friendly countries really fought in it. The battlefields were located in various regions, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defenses were defeated by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night, these plans lost their meaning, as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Transporting goods by ship is clearly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been so that their country would be able to outweigh its men and goods, and at the same time the enemy would not be able to outweigh its men and goods.
The North Atlantic Campaign during World War II was one of the most significant examples of this idea. In order to help Britain, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this movement, using, mainly, submarines.
Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way that it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
Goats were first domesticated in Iran's Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them in order to always have milk, wool, meat and leather on hand.
Usually, domestic goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. They were often cared for by the Capitol, whether they were children or teenagers. The latter played the role of shepherds. That's how animals feed today.
In the 16th century, horse-drawn roads were built in England.
Although horse-drawn roads were only parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to move at a higher speed and pull loads with more weight than on existing rough roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after a while, it became clear that the movement on the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the cars wore out faster.
After a while, the wooden circle was replaced by iron wheels. The first slats made entirely of metal appeared in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was the Hawaiian Army. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning "man walking"), people began to walk in an upright posture.
Australopithecus, their predecessors, usually did not go straight.
Australopithecus have been found in fossils that are 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, but it is possible that seven million years ago the Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs.
You can be more conscious of the environment, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future these sufferings will not be very strong.
In some cases, it looks more like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we need more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to the technological and scientific achievements of mankind, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overcrowding and wasteful lifestyles, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy of it, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing press, which was a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Papers".
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, 2010, another man arrived in London.
To date, the first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it still exists, only we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
Birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can contain only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
Internal poisoning can first be indicated by an open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for urgent medical care for this particular poison should be looked at on the label.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in the formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term originated because people have long known what bed bugs are — those insects that are highly adapted to being parasitic on humans.
Both kissing flaps and bed flaps are nesting parasites, they are accustomed to life in nests or in the house of their master.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported in the United States. Accordingly, this neurological disease is the main one among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
According to the study, women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that the upbringing of an infant is not in their best interests or the interests of the child that they already have.
Couples can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the child's natural parents give up their parental rights so that he or she can be raised and raised by other spouses.
The main goal of science is to find out through the scientific method the way the world works. In fact, most scientific research is carried out using this method.
However, there is not only him. An experiment (this is a test that is carried out to rule out one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists have paid most attention to classical texts. First of all, we are talking about the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were generally accepted at the time.
When the number of people who spoke Greek decreased, the West found itself torn from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms that can be observed in animal behavior and physiology depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have recorded periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is an autonomous process. Even if there are no signals from the outside, the said process continues in the form of independent free-flowing cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is genetic material, was tested during the experiment of Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of the bacteriophage through radioactive phosphorus or through radioactive sulfur, the bacteriophage protein.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Mutations in germ cells can only be hereditary. Other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting various natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including observing flora and fauna.
Examples of what you can do in nature include fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystems.
An example is visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People leave their cars every morning to go to work. Along the way, they pass by other people who work in the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic transport cycle, everyone has one or the other to do with and supports the private car-based transport system.
Scientific evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transportation systems are used by all people who participate in the life of society. Almost all of them are unhappy with these systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about falling bridges or water quality.
Why is it that transport systems are a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly cease to operate? Is it because of the lack of skilled engineers? Is there something more important going on?
The concept of "traffic" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is a difficult problem, because it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, the drivers usually behave quite consistently; Therefore, as a rule, transport flows are characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be roughly described with the help of mathematical models.
In order to show more fully and qualitatively what the movement of vehicles is, it has been established how its three main parameters are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as to engage in their operation.
Insects were the first to enter the air. The ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more effectively, as well as to find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are folded along the body.
Due to this, they can kill themselves in various very small places to hide there from predators.
Dragonflies and flies are now the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus said thousands of years ago that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many held a different view — that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
Sounds like a good idea, but it's hard to tell if it's moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times greater than in the river, which occupies the second place.
The largest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all water entering the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which waters flow from thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although the construction of pyramids using stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, in terms of size and technical perfection of construction, no one has ever been able to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the period of the New Kingdom were delighted with the monuments erected by their ancestors, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
There are only about 800 people living in the Vatican. It is the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Italian is used in the Vatican's laws and official statements.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Due to the fact that the main chemical elements (for example, gold, silver and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with the help of primitive tools, people knew about them in ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that states that all things contain one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they could transform into other substances to eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, which include a small number of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that at the point at the end of this sentence, there are trillions of them.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the importance of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new writing methods appeared.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a sharpener.
We can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard if it is replaced by something fundamentally new.
The principle of operation of the plutonium bomb is to use the energy of nuclear fusion, when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like riding a very heavy hill. The re-fission of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to disintegrate with little or no external influence.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the punishment.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side it is about 100 km.
Under lunar dreams, the moon's crust is thinner, and under the highlands, it is thicker.
There may be more lunar seas on the closest side of the moon, because there is a thinner crust, and, accordingly, it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Meaningful theories focus on what drives people or what drives them.
These theories proceed from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they turn into internal ones and which are given a subjective character (in other words, internalized) during adulthood.
These theories describe what exactly makes individuals want what they do, and what factors in their environment can influence whether they do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two authoritative theories.
In fact, when leaders lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can occur. At one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "your boyfriend" (or "your girlfriend").
A manager belonging to this type may have difficulty evaluating performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility and bringing the perpetrators to justice.
The other extreme is a situation where a person changes beyond recognition — feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and appropriate it to themselves.
At the end of the day, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this type of behavior ends in quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Standards of excellence for regular teams should also be followed by virtual teams, but there are slight differences.
Usually, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the relevant real group.
Given that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be clear to local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of executives to which each member reports is the so-called "invisible team". It sets standards for each member.
What is the reason why an organization might want to go through a lengthy process of forming a training organization? Innovation is one of the goals of putting into practice organizational learning concepts.
Creativity and ingenuity can be manifested when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization.
Thus, the process used by an organization whose employees are trying to overcome an obstacle together can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The leadership of the organization must create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning. Only then can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuum approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. As a result, the scope of research is narrowed down and more accurate.
The results of the research obtained by scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of traumatic brain injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain have an impact on behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes in it that we do not know yet.
Thanks to this, we get a huge amount of materials and data to build simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" is commonly associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the study of the behavior, learning process, and intelligent adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves attempts to get machines to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to requests and technical problems from customers, and to recognize faces, voices, and handwriting.
They are separated into separate disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions to them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in the economic, medical, technical, and military spheres. In addition, it is a software component for some computer programs and video games.
Travel is a big part of schooling. Teachers often take students to places that cannot be reached by car.
With the help of modern technology, it is possible to organize virtual tours. Students can see the museum's exhibits, visit the aquarium or admire the beauty of the works of art. And all of this without leaving the classroom.
Taking part in virtual tours together is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences in classes in the future.
Students at the Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, make a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and every year it is remade, but the old versions remain on the Internet in the form of an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language. Although grammar and spelling are often "lame" at the beginning of blogging, this tends to change for the better, due to the presence of an audience.
Given that students are usually the most picky audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve his style.
In addition, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them". The need to keep the audience engaged inspires them and compels them to remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach suggests.
If learners use blogging appropriately, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; An active response to online materials will help students to outline their own position on other people's writings, as well as to express their own views on individual problems" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the fascinating and charming bilingual capital of Canada. There are many art galleries and museums that offer an opportunity to learn about the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
That is why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Ontario to be a typical Canadian province.
Large parts of the country, farther north, are inhabited by very few people, and some are almost desertless.
To compare the population, we can cite the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the United States exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located off the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest of them. When it comes to nature, it can be compared to a continent.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their beautiful beaches.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, dates the beginning of European influence and the politics of colonialism.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to always say that they are married, even if they are not.
In addition, it may be useful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may be exposed to behaviors that seem harassing to them. Local residents can often annoy tourists, grab hands, and so on.
Strongly reject men and boldly defend your opinion (despite cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they left this place.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bajia. The city got its name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Near the Old Town of the Medina, you can quickly find places selling traditional Moroccan products - leather goods, pottery, tagines, hookahs and various toys, but all of them are intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma swept lava from the Nyiragonga volcano off the face of the earth. It covers most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is safe enough to go beyond its borders, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out if at some point there is fighting in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragonga volcano. It also offers very cheap services for lovers of mountain gorilla watching - more attractive prices in Africa are difficult to find.
You can take a taxi to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the relative inaccessibility of Timbuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu is a city where poverty reigns.
In 1990, due to the threat posed by desert sands, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city in the PBS program "Wonders of the African Continent".
Compared to the rest of the country, the city stands out even more because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is bordered by the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km². It has 14 ecozones, each of which is home to different animals and different plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's National Parks.
As with all national parks in South Africa, the park has a daily entrance fee and an environmental fee.
In addition, it can be profitable to purchase the so-called Wild Card - a season ticket that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks of South Africa.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings that form the city's architectural appearance are juxtaposed with a brilliant bar chart, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only underscore its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed if you leave the island and head to the opposite of the Kawloon promenade.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on drained lands.
In the past, this place was captured by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see with your own eyes the evidence of the country's colonial past, then you need to start here.
The Sundarbans Forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarbans National Park" is a part of the forest that is located in India.
Not only are the mangrove swamps called forests, but also some of the last remote jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain and still survive.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans Forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and currently, according to reports, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are found in the region.
From the interdistrict bus station (which is located across the river), buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases, they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is in the Bumthang district).
Due to the fact that interdistrict buses are often overcrowded, tickets are recommended to be purchased a couple of days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small buses Coaster made in Japan serve most areas.
A shuttle taxi is a convenient and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as the towns of Punakha (fare 200 ngultrum) and Paro (fare 150 ngultrum).
The bridge that crosses the river is a bridge. It connects the banks of the Ayapoque River, on which two cities are located, Ayapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges de Luapoque (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The carriageway consists of two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was only opened to traffic in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a life of semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming, were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the territory of present-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Payagua and Guaikuru, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they hunted, fished, and gathered.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", actually came into existence in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors encountered indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has maintained its identity and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place at the Las Conitas Polo Grounds.
At other times of the year, there are tournaments and smaller tournaments.
Information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP). It is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the only bank in the whole country, located in Port Stanley opposite the store "FCC West".
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment anywhere on the islands. In addition, Stanley itself often accepts credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Remote islands probably won't accept credit cards. At the same time, they can accept British or American cash; Ask the owners what their payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange local currency outside of the Falkland Islands, so do so before you leave.
If it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. The reason is that the city is south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer rarely drops below freezing, but due to the wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels cooler than it actually is.
Precipitation levels do not change throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, there is no need to feed or disturb them — wild animals remain wild.

Snow, ice and freezing temperatures - all this should be taken into account by anyone who is going to visit the northern latitudes or cross mountain passes.
The grip coefficient on snowy and ice-covered roads is low, so you can not drive as if there is just asphalt under the wheels.
During a snowstorm, you can get so much snow in a very short time that you get stuck.
In addition, visibility may be limited due to snowfall or blizzard or freezing ice or moisture condensation on car windows.
At the same time, snowy weather and icing are a common occurrence in many countries, and traffic there is not interrupted throughout the year.
The most popular tourist pastime in Africa is probably safari, for many tourists it is the most interesting moment.
In a common sense, the term "safari" means an overland journey, particularly across the savannah, where you can see the beautiful wild African environment.
Typically, individual animals, including giraffes and elephants, get close to cars, and even standard equipment can guarantee good visibility.

If you don't have much driving experience on country roads, always be careful: there are a lot of steep slopes, narrow lanes for traffic and unexpected turns.
The existing speed limits here are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent segments — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is very important to strictly adhere to them.
Fun fact: The cell phone signal here is much stronger than along many other stretches of the way, say near the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Pastries in Germany are quite good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, it is quite satisfying and varied.
Fruit flour products are widespread, in which apples are added all year round, and in summer, in addition, cherries and plums.
In many German pastries, you can find hazelnuts, almonds and other hazelnuts. Coffee is often a good partner for popular cakes.
If you're looking for a small but high-calorie pastry, try one that, depending on the area, is called berliner, pfankuchen or krapfen.

The straps hang down on both sides of the saddle and are supports for the rider's feet.
They give the rider more stability, but there may be safety problems because the rider's legs can get stuck.
If the rider falls off the horse, his leg can catch on the shot. In this case, if the horse is frightened and begins to run away, he can drag the rider behind him. To minimize the risk of this, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
Firstly, special shoes with heels and soft, rather narrow soles are worn by most riders.
In addition, for some saddles, especially English ones, protective arcs are provided. When the rider pulls back the strap when falling, the protective arches allow him to fall off the saddle.

Skiing: This is the name of skiing in remote areas, skiing or skiing.
It is close to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but does not usually include them. The latter are engaged in steep areas of the terrain and need much harder skis and shoes for them.

Under the right conditions, you can walk a little more than if you walked. However, it is very rare to gain the same speed as skiing on a paved track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent. However, there are many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means that tourists and travelers need to repeatedly go through passport control and submit visa applications.
At the same time, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
As a rule, you have the opportunity to cross borders without going through passport control points again while you are in this area.
In the same way, if you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and simplifies the paperwork procedure.
There is no universal definition on the basis of which manufactured things belong to antiques. Some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they were manufactured more than 100 years ago.

Handicrafts can be called antiques, although they are less years old than similar goods of mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture of trade that accompanies it is important for people of other professions.

If a warning is issued in relation to the country you plan to visit about the dangers or undesirability of traveling there, this may have an impact on the terms of health insurance for the period of travel or on the travel cancellation insurance.
You can also take advantage of the advice of government agencies of other countries rather than your own, but their advice is intended accordingly for the citizens of their country.
For example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, U.S. citizens may face different situations while in the Middle East.
The recommendations and warnings about the dangers are only a summary of the country's political circumstances.
They often express general, superficial and simplistic views, especially when compared with more detailed information that can be obtained from other sources.
Extreme weather is an umbrella term for dangerous weather events that can cause damage, disrupt public life, or cause loss of life.
The weather can be harsh in any part of the world. Depending on the geographical location, relief and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take different forms.

In different countries, governments are willing to issue passports with an indeterminate gender (X) to varying degrees or make changes to documents according to the desired name and gender.
Foreign governments are willing to implement these documents to a very different extent.
In addition, after September 11, 2001, surveillance at checkpoints became much more shameless.
It is unlikely that transsexuals who have not yet had surgery will be able to go through the scanner and at the same time their dignity and right to privacy will not suffer.
A rebound current, which is often seen on a reef or similar location, is a backflow from waves bouncing away from the beach.
The reverse flow is concentrated in several areas with great depth, which is associated with underwater topology, and there it is possible to form a fast current to great depths.
The cause of most deaths is fatigue when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the water, it won't be difficult to get back.
Try to go where you don't want to swim again. Also, if your skills allow it, or if you are noticed, you can stay in place and wait for rescue.
Due to the smaller phase of the honeymoon, the shock of returning home can occur earlier than the culture shock. It can be more serious and have a longer duration.
Travelers who have had no trouble adapting to a new culture can find it very difficult to re-adapt to the culture of their homeland.
People who return to their homeland, having lived abroad for a certain period of time, are already accustomed to the culture of the new country. They have lost some of their habits that were once learned in their native culture.
Surely, when you visited a foreign country for the first time, people were patient and sympathetic because they knew that travelers needed time to adapt.
Many people do not expect that understanding and patience are necessary for those travelers who return to their homeland.
One of the activities that your children may be most interested in is the sound and light show that takes place around the pyramids.

The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and acts as the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids serve as a screen for narrative plots, and the various pyramids are illuminated from time to time.
Several states claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. This is where the largest number of bases is located. In 2020, there were still 16 of them.
The archipelago separates from the peninsula a distance of 120 km in the direction of the north. The largest island is called King George, and on it is the village of Villa Las Estrelas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where a scenic natural harbor has formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea, lies south of the peninsula.
At this point, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau. Then they grow out of it again, forming a chain of 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains. The Minnesota Legislature is going to cut it in half.
Antarctica's highest mountain range, Vinson, is located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. The highest in it is Mount Vinson, which reaches 4892 m.

Tuition fees for these programs are usually paid.
Finland is one of the best places to go rowing or boating. In addition, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands that are found in both lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On lakes and archipelagos, you can do without a yacht.
Even though the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks can have a completely different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. For every 7 or 8 people, there is one boat.
This can be seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is at the level of one to forty).
Most of the memorable cruises in the Baltic are characterized by a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that for a few full days you have the opportunity to walk around the historic part of the city, returning to spend the night on the ship.

Some cruises in their brochures offer to visit Berlin, Germany. However, if you look at the map, you can see that Berlin is far from the sea. In addition, the cost of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying an airplane can be a daunting experience, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced some kind of traumatic accident.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is the same fear as other personal fears or aversion to certain things that many people feel.
For some, it can help to overcome the fear that arises from the fear of the unknown or loss of control, understanding how airplanes are designed and what happens during flight.
Courier services pay well for fast delivery of things. In many cases, when delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is of the essence.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, however, as for other routes and not so large firms, there was a problem.
If things were sent by air, then it may take several days for unloading and customs on some routes.
Checked baggage was the only way to get the cargo faster. Airlines don't allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come into play.
The obvious way to get into first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for such a privilege (or better yet, having a company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: practice shows that compared to a regular economy class, you can pay four times more for business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Basically, there is no point in looking for discounts on tickets for direct flights from A to B to First or Business Class.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege to reach their destination quickly and comfortably. So they're paying the right fee.
The capital of Moldavia is the city of Chisinau. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities live and where ethnic conflict has taken place.
As a result of this conflict in 1994, the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was formed in the eastern part of Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but no EU country recognizes it.

With the help of this method, it is always possible to distinguish verbs from nouns that denote objects.
It may also make it easier to read, but it makes writing somewhat more difficult because you need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is being used in the substantive form.
Most of the words in the Italian language are pronounced exactly as they are written, so the pronunciation here can hardly be called difficult.
The main attention should be paid to the letters "c" and "g", because their pronunciation depends on the next vowel.

However, people who are able to speak a little Spanish can make a hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar to it and therefore does not require separate study.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete, and serve as museums or training centers.
Usually, such observatories were located in cities or on the territory of universities, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason for this is simple: light pollution is a much bigger problem today than it used to be.
The bulk of research telescopes nowadays are grandiose objects of gigantic size, usually located in peripheral areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
"Hanami", which means admiration of cherry blossoms, entered the culture of Japan as early as the 8th century.
