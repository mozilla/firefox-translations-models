Shouting the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have started well and shouting and shouting in nature have begun to draw people around the world.
“You have the mystery, I need Iceland,” a woman in the big world commented on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube content provider.
Another observer says that she will preserve Iceland in her heart for all eternity and a young woman says that she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiancé resides there.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States, so she expects to have to wait a few months yet.
Another observer asks if the trail to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
It doesn't matter if he comes from a different time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in the preparation of the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that the reception has exceeded expectations.
“I came to a lot of Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been going very well, but this new campaign is already starting to beat the record.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, which total more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at 1.8 billion ISK.
It's not bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been going very well there, even though the United States is not on its way to the country anytime soon.
According to Egil, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also welcomed, like Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then came a reaction from exotic regions, such as India, which was not specifically proposed.
“These advertisements have travelled more widely than we expected,” says Egill, who has watched over four million people on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The photos at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer of Morgunblaðið, when she was shooting advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The filming took place all over the world, such as Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, Reynisfjara, Skógarfoss, Sólheimajökull and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of Skot productions and cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in the film were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the making of the advertisements, but at the same time as recordings took place in the South of Iceland, there was another group in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egil, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which aims to launch a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Promote Iceland,” says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi went extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, arrives in Sprengisandur, starting at ten in Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural affairs and migration work out to land that has been poorly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the show. He will discuss his criticisms regarding pension funds' investments and proposes that the labour movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, East Iceland Traveler, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the North Iceland Marketing Office, will also be interviewed about the situation in tourism in rural areas.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading sign of what is to come.
Listen to the show below, but it starts at ten.
This is what it looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth television of any kind.
However, she gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared on the television show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills in 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
She has had little to do with it lately, but she was able to look over the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television recently.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I met in schools that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was," Donovan said of his performance in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night's stay
About fifty cases came to the table of the police in the capital area today and the police diary says that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgata began with police having to intervene with a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police orders telling him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of burglary at a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to reports of assault.
There was also the fact that a woman who was dining in a shopping centre in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There were also reports of theft of a car in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van was temporarily hunting her off and was then taken unfree.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joyful Band - The Terrible Fate of the Glee Stars
The theory has reached the Internet for a curse over the series about the Gleði band, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the show's third lead actor to die far in advance.
The series about the joy squad (e. Glee) is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series covered the so-called youth joy squad in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the pleasure to be in the joy band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside of the set, great disasters have hit actors and employees of the show, so much so that theories have arisen that there is a curse on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call her grandmother.
After the season, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to inform police that he and his mother had gone swimming and then Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there herself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that during the search, it was assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
She is believed to have been hit by heavy currents in the water and made use of her last claim in saving the son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American footballer with the angel voice who played a key role in bringing the band of Joy to the band.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape her.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough had come, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out having fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that this was a willingness.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance to intoxicating had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well, proved fatal.
He was just 31 when he was killed.
His death weighed heavily on his colleagues, but at the insistence of his counterpart Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show and they dedicated a whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finnur.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Pleasure Band, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a house search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the case soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.
He faced four to seven years in prison, and he would have to be on the record of sex offenders and seek treatment for childish desire.
Before the judge had determined the penalty, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell from far in advance.
Jim Fuller was the show's assistant director.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of Julia Roberts, and she did not tell her beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and degrading behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, saying that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was placed.
“My mother and my siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was they who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and aggression on set and having a superficial star.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, she found out that unscrupulous hackers made nude photos of her and posted it on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play in a garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the kids in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think we are many fishermen working in the country’s preschools,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.”
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking student loans.
The income is also good for me during the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in recent summers.
Axel was new to the dock in Tálknafjörður when a journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
“The winter I was in tenth grade, I took a captain’s license for boats that are less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I've been fishing in my boat ever since.
I bought a boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I made the boat name his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half by the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million dollars to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
“I had already made a donation and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summers and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied these areas in the West by rowing with my dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the whole of the Westfjords.
Although I like to be in the west, I have also provided around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and beyond.
I’ve also been to the south, but mostly a lump of grass,” says Axel, who always rows one early in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in the solitude for hours in the sea.
“The internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don’t think it’s easy being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but there has certainly been something wrong with the weather, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day depends on how the fishing goes at any given time.
“In the coastal fishing I am never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been continuously for one and a half days grazing at sea fishing.”
The arrangement in coastal fishing says that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds inhibiting.
“Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to paddle instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose according to their own head.
Then the division of the area could also go because of me and the marine space that is well located by fishing grounds should be allowed to enjoy it,” says Axel, who mostly draws cod from salty seawater during his coastal fishing, but also only saithe and occasional other species of rivers.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think we’re many fishermen who work in the country’s preschools,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the nursery.
“I’m stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future,” says Axel, who has also come a long way with his studies in business administration.
Error in registration prevented homecoming infection practices
Error in a registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland caused a person, resident in Iceland, not to be called back for testing.
It is not a requirement to register an ID number if the person in question fills out the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," an expert at the Directorate of Health said.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of Landspítali yesterday.
One of those who tested positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called homecoming precautions came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in Iceland and again called for testing four to five days later.
It was revealed in RÚV's lunchtime news that the person in question had, however, complied with the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the Directorate of Health's Department of Disease Prevention and Control, told the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to insert a social security number as is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question has not received an automatic invitation to come for a test.
However, many say that many have followed the rules on the visitation portal even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people for testing again after they arrived in Iceland.
“This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to get their attention on the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go for testing but two were starting to show symptoms.
Infection tracking is currently ongoing with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is mostly over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of deCODE genetics has revealed that this is a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In one case, the bands have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be known tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation according to the web COVID. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not yet found the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Infection tracking is still ongoing.
Originally, over a dozen were exceptionally sent to quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are in quarantine due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that a sporting event has been detected and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Johann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager at the Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, says that this is possible, as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
“We are constantly pushing everyone here to maintain individual infection control measures.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to be followed.
Then you can hold an event," says Johann.
He says infection can be prevented by airing individual infection control measures.
Rules and criteria are also under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health are constantly pressing for people, is to consider these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and at the same time at service companies.
To wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going forward,” Johann said.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good journey we were on, in order to sustain the progress we have made so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult her father was to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was indicated on the death certificate as an underlying problem and is Brumfield, who also has diabetes, terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters reports that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures from a new study commissioned by U.S. authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When looking at the proportion of people who had not reached the age of 65, the ratio rises to half.
The US Department of Health's Investigation (CDC) investigated more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
A survey was conducted by Reuters, pointing out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet beginning to report underlying conditions.
“Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age,” Reuters reports Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American origin, which has also gone worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control with a healthy diet and the help of health care professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In addition, high prices of insulin have consumed some to continue to show up for work, thereby risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the dangers that those with type 2 diabetes could be caused by the virus.
As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group had a three-fold higher risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS so observed in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the ICU had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, said that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could longer, the pandemic has stripped the veil of a number of previously naughty complications.
"I fear we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Association of Diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research indicates that the coronavirus may lead to a proliferation of diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people who have diabetes.
Then a high rate of glucose and lipids in diabetics can produce a true “cytokine storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation which in turn can cause a deadly blood clot.
"It's all one big puzzle," Dela Cruz said.
“It’s all related to each other.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, then they left the room.”
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason complied with the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t easy.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very impressed with her.
It was just the radiance, but I thought it was also very cute.
And still is," he said.
Asrún also remembers this, as the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last time just this weekend," she said, who was also attracted to her husband at first impression.
“I felt and felt so excited around Atli, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I'm fascinated by it."
Atli says that the couple have emphasized in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags the same as our fellow travelers.
We avoid the routines we identify around us.”
That is possibly why they took the talk from artist Ragnar Kjartansson just to rejoice, although it was unusual to say the least.
“Our mutual friend, Kristín Anna, contacts us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had a dessert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who guided them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Ásrún says that he described the work as a banal and a decadent scene from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining in."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show young middle-class couples making love in a minimalist room.
“It’s a start and an end,” he said.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much even though they knew about him and him from them “but they knew us and felt we fit in.
They said they didn’t want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others.”
They said goodbye and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps, we said, 'Aren't we just up for it?'
It was just that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,” says Ásrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and intimacy.”
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film team; cameraman, Ragnar and the soundman and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We didn’t decide what we should be like.
We got some little guidance but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no play, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," Ásrún says.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” Atli says, and Ásrún agrees.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was happy with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi was watching it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," Atli says.
“It’s just as much about love and intimacy as it does itself,” Ásrún says.
The couple's parents have seen the work and tells Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts thinking about it,” he said.
“My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone like that, but then my dad just sent me a message and says, “It’s nice to run into the little family at the Palais de Tokyo.”
And I wonder if the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
“We’re still together, so maybe it’s something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family-in-law,” Ásrún says and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I thought it was a little hard not to be with you, but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see because it’s just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other pieces it’s really cool.
I could have gotten away from it and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child when the scene was filmed.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first semi-final
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the first game between the teams in the semi-finals of the play-off to qualify for the Premier League.
The match was played at Swansea's home stadium in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
Swansea's home crowd conceded a penalty in the 64th minute but Andre Ayew failed the arc art off the penalty point and let the defence go.
Just two minutes later, Brentford's player Rico Henry received a red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game a man fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then made up for the penalty mess by scoring a great goal and secured Swansea a 1–0 win.
Swansea lead 1–0 in the duel, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at home to Brentford.
Ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since the resignation of U.S. Ambassador Carol Van Voorst in April 2009, the country has been an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office to the effect that she would not be honoured.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor arrived, in September 2010.
It can be attributed to Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then dropped out.
Loius Ariega had been working in the Foreign Service for decades.
He retired in the autumn of 2013 and became ambassador to Guatemala.
Another ambassador took a while.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, when no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long-availed to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
It took two years for the U.S. Congress to convene Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him about his spurs and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been of Dutch origin.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Jewish Republican Jewish Coalition.
The club's owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was nominating people for key positions as well as the fact that in recent years, the work of the U.S. Congress has been greatly delayed, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, there has been an ambassadorship in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the Embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateigur.
The construction is believed to have cost about 6.5 billion, but nods of safety walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, that does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former ÍBV player, says he was subjected to racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to Iceland.
This is according to an interview with Tonny, published on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in Uganda's top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in Iceland, but he played with ÍBV, Valur and Þrotti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position but in addition he also had the jersey number that I wanted to have so I got neither of the things I wanted,” says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with ÍBV.
Among the things Tonny discusses is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what the matter was.
He then told me that my opponent made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined the Haugesund.
He said he made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to get into the starting line-up at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get," Tonny said, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway he would probably go further.
He says the loan to Iceland has ruined his dreams of joining a major team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the tonsil of a woman who sought it.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with tongs.
A study found that the parasite was involved.
CNN reports about it.
The woman had a few days earlier eaten sashimi, which are thin meat slices.
The woman improved quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often in raw meat or fish.
Since sushi has emerged in the West, the number of cases of parasites in people has increased, according to CNN.
Fears that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is currently in focus in the context of concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken steps to restrain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against travel to Spain.
Infections are also increasing again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance to curb the spread of the virus and restart the economy.
The situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, with the incidence of infection globally approaching 300 thousand per day, where the most common infections in the Americas and South Asia.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of confirmed infections is 16 million worldwide, with deaths confirmed to be 644 thousand.
Gerdur's mosaic finally gets to enjoy itself to the fullest
In front of the Reykjavík Customs House is a large and deep hole.
There are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is capable, and many now stop and observe works of art from millions of mosaic tiles — as if they had never seen it before.
They may have never seen it before.
At least not respected it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of there were parking spaces that were always besieged.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their errands in the city center.
“A lively and diverse public space” and a “attractive cityscape” are the guiding principles of the current remake of Tryggvagata.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic of Gerður Helgadóttir at the Custom House to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well placed by the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
In the area there will also be small “fog sprayers”, a kind of water sculptures, which offer play and provide a certain mystery to the area.
In this way, the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is responsible for construction together with Veitur Utilities.
The pipes of water supply, district heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come of age, but the sewage pipe and cold water pipes are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city centre for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
But it will be a one-way street and at the same time create a quieter and more accessible space for walking.
In information about the Customs House on the website of the Directorate of Customs, it says that the building was taken into use in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because a harbour pass through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface formed to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall streetscape, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed to have a permanent work of art installed there.
During this time, a great deal of talk about Gerður Helgadóttir, artist, said in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was made to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to mirror life at the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When the artist was interviewed, she became increasingly fascinated by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided to do it herself, and when she returned home she submitted a few suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, a comprehensive agreement was requested with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art around Europe.
Contracts were reached and Gerður prepared the artwork for the installation of the brothers' workshop, which then arranged the installation of the Customs House.
The whole work was exceptionally well done, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has since passed the unhealthy Icelandic weather.
It took Gerði about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed at the age of 47.
Prepares for the transfer of more institutions to the country
The Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, announces that more public institutions will be exported to Iceland in the near future.
This is what the minister said on the show Sprengisandur on the wave at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the Fire Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur this autumn.
Six experts in the field of fire affairs work for the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the National Association of Fire and Ambulance Service has criticized the migration.
“I think we should take a step further in this.
I'm preparing for further steps into this creature.
Further transport," Ásmundur said.
He said he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants to see more public institutions around the country.
“I think there needs to be further political decisions about the transfer of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority,” said Ásmundur, who also took the example of other institutions that have been exported to the country and were of great importance for communities in the country, such as the transfer of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of the championship
94. The Icelandic athletics championship ended today at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri.
A number of tournament records were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was expected in the women's throwing at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Icelandic record in a slug in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form recently, but she has three-timed the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been battling an injury and didn't recover today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw for the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her record set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was somewhat off.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH-ingur Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder, won the tournament, a sure victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his second last throw and set a tournament record.
His record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Icelandic record holder in the round throwing competition, won the competition in ball projection at Þórsvöllur yesterday but today he competed in a round throw which is his main subject.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for the 2nd place, 49,43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with excellence, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her record in Iceland.
In the women's 200 meters, the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the most pop-up in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the industry is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was a success in Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and in the 4 x 100 meters relay race and then also in the 4 x 400 meters relay race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meters in the 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Not getting a fine for a 27 million ISK Bitcoin harvest
The Internal Revenue Board has rejected a claim by a tax investigator who demanded a fine over a person for under-experiencing his capital gains arising from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not made clear why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the Director of Tax Investigations considered the man to have the position of submission of materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had under-expected his capital gains arising from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin of 27 million, either intentionally or out of gross necrecity.
A fine was imposed on the man for his conduct.
The man declined in a letter to the committee.
He agreed to sell cryptocurrencies for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had her burial in 2009 and 2010, when it would have been easy and undocked with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax enforcement for such a sale had been significantly vague and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such measures in the tax return.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his assets in the tax return as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both the connoisseurs and the Director of Internal Revenue how this would be done but to no avail.
He also believed that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarize himself with complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for these two income years would be re-determined and the surcharge applied but otherwise not made a penalty.
He also reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties in an undue manner.
The claim for a fine would be out of all moderation and would plunge it into debt.
Brynjólfur raises the question: "This man understands what football is about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been around a lot between people's teeth but has also impressed him for his performance for the rest of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max league.
They will be in the line of fire tonight when they host ÍA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a play-off because of four reminders during the season and therefore does not show up with a new haircut like in the games of the summer so far.
He had had his "blah, blah, blah" written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was a bit more trying to play.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was anyone going to equalize this game I thought he would do it or create it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max box, when it came to Brynjólfur.
“I’m here for the people.”
“It’s hard sometimes to figure out what position he is in.
He looks a little bit on the left when it's going to go on, but he's got a very free rumour in the team," Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and celebrates getting such a colorful man in the league: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There are a lot of people who tell me that this guy understands about what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and I'm enjoying it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying themselves in and watching what is next for him.
“This guy is just a genius,” he said.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-league"
Tobias Thomsen, a player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the season in his home country, but for this he must first terminate his contract with KR as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The club knows I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B-League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR.”
He said he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Now responds to himself after DV's coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs out and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "wheel whisperer" as a result.
Yesterday there was a lot of noise when you published an account of your relationship with Bjartmar.
DV referred to a discussion on the Facebook group of Vesturbægir where it was stated that Bjartmar took the man to talk in Austurvöllur and said that the scooter could be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electric shuttle but that Bjartmar had theft.
Those texts have now been changed to Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of an electric shuttle that these were truly their own electric shuttles.
That information got the alleged owner from another person, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as there was information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was searched.
I hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive on the shuttle, I decided to punch the man in to talk to him.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I am very good at this, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me.”
Bjartmar says the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
“Yeah, that’s great,” said Bjartmar, “let’s get this straight.”
So the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the correct owner of the electric shuttle reported on his story on Facebook, as reported in a previous story.
In the little over a year that Bjartmar has studied this practice, he says he can count the times he encountered with people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the least of the brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
“Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to do that,” says Bjartmar.
“My communication with these people is really so good that I have a lot of good people on my side.
There have been instances of people going to rehab and getting involved, then looking to me and helping me with what I’m doing.”
In general, Bjartmar's communication with bicycle people is on a polite note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, trailer numbers of bikes and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to suggest people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV's previous news coverage and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is now not on slippery ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly.
“Of course, the police are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
For example, I've watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She’s honest about this.”
“When the cops aren’t doing anything about it, and it’s just right under your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this case, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has made so much progress in tracking on stolen bikes, that sometimes he bumps into his “clients” on the street that they only had the right Brighter wheels that they had previously recovered from.
The time Bjartmar has called for the assistance of the police has happened that she simply does not attend.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame,” Bjartmar said, and regrets that the victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the indifference of the police in this area.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
In many places you can find stories of people thanking Bjartmar for having got their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts probably run into millions, if not millions.
Weighing electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, while electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works in kindergarten every day and every other weekend he works in a cohabitation.
His bike search is therefore an unpaid job he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a huge anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, of course, received a pension from the Danish king every street from 19. century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established for officials that eventually became the pension fund of all civil servants.
The basis for the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid by collective agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.
The wage-earnery pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labour movement propelled with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly received in historic strikes in 1955, and the association also gradually received its demands for sick leave rights and sickness funds, significant vacation rights, shortening of working hours, housing reform and other important issues.
All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but proved, in retrospect, a much greater and more permanent benefit than the increase in the number of coins in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard in the inflation period that characterised the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The prelude to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.
Although it was finally agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of the fund members, the union movement had to accept that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members on equal terms.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for the majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the unions of employees, but it never succeeded, and therefore we are still left with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds is a discussion of the investment policy of the funds.
Item 1 states that “the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of the fund members.”
Item 5 also states: “A pension fund shall set ethical standards in investments.”
The shareholders' policy of the Traders' Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and in Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of portfolios.
This combines the interests of investors and the objectives of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: to maintain good corporate governance for social responsibility and environmental issues.
Gildi Pension Fund, which is one of the largest funds in Iceland, has adopted a “policy for responsible investment” and contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion of the Icelandic language, “Shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not expected that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most taken”: Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of a pension fund a recommendation or instructions on how to take a stand in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, however, it is not “shadow management” as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll leave the reader to think about which way he finds "shadier."
There are, in particular, two people who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
Hörður Ægisson journalist at Fréttablaðið and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, are present.
The occasion for both was born after Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason had stated his intention to terminate the company's agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (resign them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, sent out the recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Traders' Pension Fund not to support the fund's potential purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Þór followed the same path with his recommendations, which were of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to speak about the matter in the Friday issue of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow control, violations of the law and a strong need for changes in the law.
There, a small thuff was indeed supposed to roll a heavy load, even though the blessed tuff had been in a subjunctive manner and also been quickly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.
I explained above the points in the Act on Pension Funds pertaining to this matter.
These matters entail that the boards of the Fund must protect the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are further elaborated in the articles of association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Retailers, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and does not have to look for examples of this in the past, as large loans of banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental disasters, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair's CEO was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Luckily, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time will tell whether it is sufficient for pension funds to invest in the company can be considered responsible to fund members in the end.

One of the infected did not use homecoming infection precautions
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic state on 15 July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to use the so-called homecoming infection precautions after arriving in Iceland and to undergo another test a few days after arrival.
He got a negative from a screening at the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society and he’s actually supposed to go to that resource,” Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the Department of Epidemiology at the Directorate of Health and deputy from the Chief Epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, told Fréttablaðið today.
“He used the English registration form and it is not mandatory to register the social security number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second sample.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually lives abroad but because of his network in the country as an Icelander he should have used it more Icelandic.
He didn’t realize this, though.
“When the ID number is not registered, you have to apply for the second test yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that was the right way," Kamilla said.
“So it is clear that we need to strengthen the information provision on this while we find some way to automate the preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their social security number.
Or to somehow make it more obvious who are participating in Icelandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person in question was very friendly with few people upon arrival in Iceland, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six people have been sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to be tested, but two of them are beginning to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his test at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was likely to have been so recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the fact that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to Iceland.
“It can’t quite be argued that this is indeed an imported infection because it’s been so long ago that he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like the two who have caused a little bit of a stir in relation to the sports tournaments.”
She says that’s unlikely because of how few people are around here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but states that it cannot be ruled out until deCODE genetics has sequenced the virus in man.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
There was a fight between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police deployed protesters pepper spray and non-banishable grenades, while protesters broke windows and set fire to.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 officers injured.
Police violence and racism were protested widely in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Police said the protest was a riot and that there was a conflict between the protest groups and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by the protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard officers gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in factions to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, in which protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, solskjaer and his men in 5th place, thereby losing out of the Champions League.
However, they still have the hope of qualifying for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
“We are not at the end.
If we get points against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season," Solskjaer said.
“But whatever happens, it’s not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to gain from getting the two teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
Clearly, people's nerves get stretched at. 15 today but Solskjaer tried to pretend that it was about any other game.
“If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this builds the company.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of that,” Solskjaer said.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours defining this period.”
"Bruno Fernandes's arrival changed a lot for us and I believe overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new infections of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
Over the past four days, more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus were reported.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a U.S. infection control government forecast model, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 15. August next.
Fear of second wave of the pandemic
The government of Spain is now trying to keep the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID—19, both Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed in a single day since the beginning of May, and the news arrives at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now obliging passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine upon return home.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain's list of safe states.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and the bars will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200 thousand residents of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in taking back an extensive curfew that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken very badly to this and likened it to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a national curfew were to be imposed again.
Many decision-makers are hoping for local resources that will reach the residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to contain the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday in addition to two in addition to the border.
Thus, five individuals with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
The Civil Protection Department said one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has been sent into isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” in quarantine.
Others sent in quarantine relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and the infection tracking is in full swing with the National Commissioner of Police's infection tracking team.
The organisers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and rules of the Chief Epidemiologist and the Civil Protection Department that are still in force and have been taken appropriately.
However, yesterday's photos of the tournament attracted attention, as it could be seen in a very close communion celebrating the good luck of his team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the organisers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says, “Parents please respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for the understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday but is related to the infection reported the previous day.
“Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and a new type of virus has been identified that has not been detected here before.”
A contact tracing is also being carried out in that case and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was diagnosed in the southwest of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral transmission.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border and are awaiting the outcome of further research as required by the border infection procedure.
Finally, the announcement states: The Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police and the Directorate of Health urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infection control measures.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go for testing at the nearest health care centre.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked during the shopping weekend - Directs guests another
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to a statement from Vesturbyggð.
Visitors are advised to check other accommodation options.
Mentions Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hotel Flókalundur and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because, like in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging from the demand for the campsite, one can expect good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a mark in the account, but DV said earlier today about the poor forecast.
However, the worst weather can be expected in the south, and hope for the Patreksfjörður people.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
An entire apartment building is decaying in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhagi 18-20.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking a building permit for renovations, but their errand has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive neighborhoods in the City of Reykjavík stands a large multi-family house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each of which has four fairly large apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, although most of them over 100.
The house has a great history.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, housed video rental, the Shoe Room, the dairy store Mjólkursamsalan, Jói the gunsmith, fish sales and most recently Háskólaprent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its fool more beautifully.
The house is now under a lot of damage, as you can see in the accompanying photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the Register of Companies, among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was in charge of Borgun's ownership group and was the head of the holding company Borgun.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore not been maintained since.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though most recently.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident says the house was "not particularly lively in recent years."
There, it may be possible to play into the fact that the owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house for a long time was not okay.
“It’s high time to do something nice about this spot and it’s sad that it’s been like this.”
He also says that he is angry at the owners of the house for not having driven to finish this, found some common surface with the neighbors of the house and stopped this “legal stuffing.”
“Just do it in consultation with the community so you can get it done and finish it.”
The “Legal Stamp” to which the resident refers is the planning process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 were then sought after permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Appeals Committee and the committee cancelled it as the project was not based on a zoning plan and the local presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík then started the zoning work and concluded it with an advertisement in the Official Journal in July last year.
That structure was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, it was almost three years since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the building at the beginning.
The house had at that time dragged down quite a bit and the neighbors began to tire.
When DV asked the neighbor of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Others turned their anger to the city, others didn't.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily into anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a dispute, but neighbors have used Dunhagi's unused parking lot 18-20 under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said he was tired of the administration:
“Let’s go through the process three times is incredible.
It’s like the City of Reykjavík couldn’t read.”
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
A memorial to the city's slow administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their years of work that is now at the beginning.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhagi 18, he was confronted with a galloping door and a pile of rubbish.
A playstation computer and a recent television were lying among other debris on the planet — victims of the Icelandic summer wet.
The old office of Háskólaprent was open and there were quite a few cats of the pee smell to judge.
It's clear that someone has nestled in one corner, but no one's visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were no doubt supposed to become a book, spotted.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
The journalist was lucky enough to run into the inhabitants of one of them.
The Romanians were boiling a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the temporary work agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and DV sources simulate that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered defensible to collect rent.
Judging by the circumstances of a post in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers living there in the recent past.
The operation of temporary-work agencies has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient in using the services of temporary-work agencies.
Nevertheless, the household members of Dunhagi 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung the work suits and mittens in the common area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter said goodbye to the Romanian boys, the irony suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands down.
Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbors want improved condition but argue about the definition of "recovery."
In between, the city's planning department is at the beginning, the victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and the final resolution of the Appeals Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house live such Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on 17 July.
In the campaign against overweight in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, in part because of his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to present the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients in overweight and will also launch an effort to increase the number of cycling paths.
The advertising of fast food restaurants on television will be banned before 21 o'clock at night, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has raised us to the short- and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier food,” a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had a weight problem, but he was admitted to intensive care when he became infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly his weight due to which he is believed to have fallen ill so severely.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater decentralization, transparency and in working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now and who better to lead that kind of change than the group of society that has an easier time being in these values.
"There are women," Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
“Now it’s time to bring about this change.”
She said that she was a little worried about the focus on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not as excited to see what we need to do.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't have the same rules here," Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders have very male values.
She said that politics revolved around, for example, its own interests, dominance and power as the forces that maintained inequalities in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little irritated that the Althingi is going to overlook this referendum from 2012,” she said.
“It’s those feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the core values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is absurd that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can switch differently," Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to fight the collective bargaining all the time just to get a decent wage.”

Trying to kidnap a pedestrian in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the hills where its driver was at a speed of 146 km with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driving licence.
The Metropolitan Police had enough going on last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise reporting due to the parties.
During the night of Saturday, there were reports of eleven noisy parties, which was considered a great deal in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise issues were found on the police table.
Six were held in a prison cell last night.
In Árbær, police were called in last night when parties launched fireworks.
They had already escaped when the policemen arrived.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk and or drug driving.
Four people were arrested over a fight in the city centre last night, one of whom was held in a prison cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in the West.
One person was taken to the emergency room after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, officers stopped the driver who towed a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's bicycle equipment was, according to the police's diary, in "a very poor condition" and it was stationed.
You can stay in the house of Monet on the shopping weekend
The house, in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next free nights in the house are on the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspiration to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone is going to rent the house, they will have to rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's page, it's next available in a week, on the Sunday shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the bank holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic krónur as the newspaper gets closer.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this and several of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that an increasing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely to society.
“The previous domestic infection has been sequenced and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has gone undercover in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very wary right now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the Directorate of Health’s infection prevention division.
Most of the infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further testing will be carried out in the near future, but several, who were in contact with the infected, have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite liberal by doing these tests on individuals who during the influenza season would have found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infection tracking is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people will have to quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
It has raised questions whether it is defensible to hold such events.
The Director of Communications for the Civil Protection says that this is possible as long as people follow the rules and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible that the infected have been infected at the sports tournaments.
“If no more people go into isolation based on these individuals after having been around them at these sports tournaments, we can argue that our infection prevention measures at the tournaments have worked.
But it's not clear," Kamilla said.
The Civil Protection Department's procedure is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there seems to be cause," Kamilla said.
In just over a week, the mass restrictions will be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could affect concessions.
“A Certain Meditation to Cook” – See Elisa Viðar’s menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer and plays with Valur.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
It takes a lot of energy for the day's activities and usually takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts with coming to work by eight,” she said.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before picking up my girl at the nursery at three o’clock.”
Elísa finds it very nurturing to pick up her daughter early in the nursery.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to training later.
After training, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty her mind.”
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once, and not always.”
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to cook in the kitchen and get it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal, so with what’s available.
Most often it is banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a great coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flatbread, pure skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoonful out of a box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of foody salads from what is available in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit what I'm working with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it is 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, do not put in more effort.
Intermediate: Get me something high in carbohydrates before training, bread with cold cuts, cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be chosen very often in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Seattle city officials have declared a state of uprising in the wake of crowded protests in the city centre.
Police yesterday resorted to flare bombs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters conquered and stretched across many blocks near the city's parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into sabotage carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say protesters stoned police with rocks, bottles, detonators and other looses and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were repaired.
Seattle's protests, however, remained peaceful for a long time.
They were blown to show solidarity to Portland, Oregon, where there has been fierce conflict between protesters and heavily armed squads by federal agents.
There, as in other U.S. cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remember Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, systematically protests racism in American society and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the layoffs of Icelandair's flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the beginning of next month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on the collective agreement of the Icelandic Air Stewardess Association on behalf of Icelandair's flight attendants ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says that she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the result of the vote is available.
“It’s definitely hanging together,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“No layoffs have been revoked, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
“People are eager to know if they will have a job after the end of the month.”
A contract signed a week ago, on the night of 19 July, is being voted on.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously struck by flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Consultative Council of the Icelandic Air Stewardess Association agreed to call a full-time work stoppage with Icelandair, which was voted on by the members.
It was never brought to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to stop negotiations with the airline, terminate all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company's pilots were also supposed to take on the work of security personnel on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to say.
“People are hurting after Icelandair’s attack, when all the company’s flight attendants were terminated and announced that an agreement would be reached with another union.
Now it turns out if it has an impact," she said.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies, for those who have the shortest working life, it is three months and ends at the end of July-August.
This group comprises 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What will happen if the deal is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing the discussion with our counterparties.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far.”
A vote on the collective agreement ends and Icelandair announces the results for the second quarter tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on the new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Air Stewardess Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers (SA) began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are allowed to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of Sunday 19 July, but on Friday before Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants struck a previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had also terminated all flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, where the provisions of pilots and flight attendants have been integrated on how long to fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who were interviewed by the news agency expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most people, however, seemed to agree that the deal would have to be approved to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating results for financial items and taxes, is negative by US$100 to US$110 million, or about US$15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Nasdaq Iceland Stock Exchange preliminary calculations last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue amounted to about US$60 million in the quarter, or about 8.3 billion ISK.
Cash equivalents were about US$154 million at the end of the quarter, around US$21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to auction the company's shares in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before a public offering will be held.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“A new virus just means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in Iceland,” says Már Kristjánsson, chief medical officer at the infectious diseases department of Landspítali University Hospital, about the news that a “new type of virus” has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed in the sports club's social activities at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unfounded and the infection trace is ongoing.
There was also an infection in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him started to show symptoms of COVID—19.
Yesterday, an infection related to infection was detected the previous day and after sequencing at deCODE genetics, it was found “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
Infection tracking is completed in connection with that infection.
Már points out that it is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could say anything about the start of another wave of epidemics, Már says that this is currently a case of a single incident and that it could be that nothing more will be done.
“But on the other hand, if there are cases of domestic contact that do not have a link from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about the second wave], but it is premature at this time,” explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC's programme-makers lead to the odds in a fun video highlighting the country's pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that there are nowhere in the world as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Children's swimming lessons were mandatory in 1940, but senior citizens are no less efficient at using the hot water for their health.
Swimming tours are described as a fixed part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Free of mobile phones, people talk on a personal note around home and abroad or enjoy the palliative power of the water: meditate and recharge the batteries of the soul and body.
Should we pick up a hundred days from the election
There are hundreds of days until Americans go to the polls and choose a president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he's got the steeple.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationwide, considering polls.
According to a new survey by the AP, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, and more Americans than before believe the president has been depressing economically.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the U.S. is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has kept well on economic issues.
In March, it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention away from his performances towards the pandemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that are supposed to relate to law and order.
Biden's campaign, however, puts a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and considers it highly likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has done his job in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be coming down on Republican senators, fearing the Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been considered highly unlikely.
Politico said recently that the party and the candidate's support is comparable, and that now the Republican Party would gain its biggest defamation in decades.
Suburbs have proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 general election, and now it appears that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburban residents into following him, including by saying that if President Biden becomes president, he will destroy the U.S. suburbs and promote racial disputes.
Among other things, Trump has suspended regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to diversify the suburbs.
Then he urged the "housewives" of the U.S. suburban to read an article by former New York's deputy governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburban area and accepted Trump.
“Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" the president said.
The population of the U.S. suburban is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump's secured a small majority in the 2016 suburbs, his support there has declined sharply.
Although it differs between surveys, Biden has measured with a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the outskirts recently.
Regis Philbin has died
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for his popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011, alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the most hour-long individual on American television and has been recognized by the public.
He won six Emmy Awards in his career and was nominated 37 times in total.
A statement from his family said Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media over the past 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have plagued to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through together.
Achievement workers have years to prepare and authorities in Japan will add to the cost of the delay.
Everyone has a header, but there's a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympic Games, the Japanese delegates' cheers were genuine.
They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but that time it bowed to a lower level for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the world's attention.
The Games are scheduled to take place from July 24 to 9. August but has been postponed for a year and instead starts on 23 July 2021 and ends on 8. August.
If the Games are not held, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top the last play.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the promotions of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation—the greater the chance of receiving the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or over 20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, was put into the presentation.
By 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion ISK on the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean considering how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Japanese organisers have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed by a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost US$12.6 billion.
However, a report from the Japan Auditor General published at the end of last year stated that the cost was nearly double that number.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the Games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
It is such a high number that all tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only be sufficient for almost half of the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to examine the numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In the shortest possible term, it seems that quite a few people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that keep them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs is greatly increased in the short term, but in the long term cities tend to be left with debt tails and the high operating costs of little-used structures.
Rio, Brazil, is facing significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to cover the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built before the Games.
Figures have been reviewed after the 2012 London Games, where it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got professionally linked to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
It means that we didn’t talk about new jobs, except for a little while.
In general, cities have not come out of the Olympics particularly well because of the sliding costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
The benefits, however, are often considered to be increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which, however, is highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accept all the crowds that usually attend the Games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities have to be chosen, but it is difficult to estimate for money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not such that it is possible to put on a price tag.
But even though the show is often great and there is nowhere to be saved, it is of course not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some accomplished people, it's surprisingly just welcome to postpone the Games.
The Australian five-year-old woman and gold medalist in her recent Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, very lighthearted and would have been far from having fun this summer, but hopes to be in the form of a competitive competition for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will stop the competition before the Games take place.
Trust their bodies simply don't in order to go through years of additional strict workouts.
Few athletes established themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as Simone Biles.
She brought home four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to attend the 2021 Games, but she is not sure if she will be still at the top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old by then.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is a higher for a top gymnast.
“This is a sensitive issue,” Biles says, but smiles in another interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page when asked if she intends to reach the same length at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a year of training," Biles said.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she trains hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop suddenly exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles any more than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly is a little better than in most people.
“We have a tough plan right now.
It was hard to start practicing first again after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly but are in full swing again and I will increase the intensity of the exercises steadily as the year progresses.
We don't really know how these games will be or whether they will be held but we still practice considering they will be, we can't do anything else.
I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," Biles said.
With it, like others, there is a doubt or perhaps more awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021 either.
To think about it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponing weddings due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress told People.
“We want to get married someday and have a dream wedding and have all the people we love.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
