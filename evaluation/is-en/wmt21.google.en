Shout out to the world
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign seems to have started well, and shouts and calls out in nature are starting to attract people from far and wide around the world.
&quot;You know the riddle, I need Iceland,&quot; says a woman out in the big world in comments to an ad from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.
Another viewer says that they will keep Iceland in their hearts forever, and a young woman says that she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiance lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the hiking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow if he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who created the ads together with the international advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi, says the reception has exceeded expectations.
&quot;I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.&quot;
Basically it&#39;s about creating PR value, it&#39;s getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it&#39;s been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, which in total reach more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It&#39;s not bad.&quot;
The main market is always the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, even though the Americans are not heading to the country anytime soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Great Britain and Germany have also responded well, as has Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there was a response from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically planned.
&quot;These ads have traveled further than we expected,&quot; says Egill, but it should be noted that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t have asked for a better start.&quot;
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, Morgunblaðin&#39;s photographer, during the filming of advertisements entitled &quot;Let It Out&quot; in the middle of last month.
The filming took place far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustíg in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjörður, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfða.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cinematographer was Óttar Guðnason.
The Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary, played the roles in said filming.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the commercials, but at the same time as filming took place in the South, another group was in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, &quot;Let It Out&quot; is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the aim is for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi.
&quot;This is just the first phase of this work for Íslandstofa,&quot; says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
&quot;It&#39;s great to work with them.
In projects like this, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.&quot;
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labor market, pension fund and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children&#39;s Affairs, attends Sprengisand, which starts at ten o&#39;clock at Bylgjuni today.
He is also the minister of the labor market and discusses the situation in the labor market as such, the Icelandair issue and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs abroad, which has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticism regarding the investments of pension funds and present ideas for the trade union movement and employers to withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
They will then be interviewed by Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourism operator in the East, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, the director of the Nordic Marketing Agency, about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading harbinger of things to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at ten o&#39;clock.
This is what she looks like today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of all kinds.
However, she gained world fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn&#39;t had a lot of fun lately, but she managed to look back and talk about Clueless on Australian TV recently.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
&quot;I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I met at school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was,” Donovan said of his performance in Clueless.
Didn&#39;t want to leave the police station after an overnight stay
About fifty cases came to the table of the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgatu began with the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after being held there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station because of his actions.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to a report of an assault.
It also happened that a woman who was having a snack in a shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay for the bill after the meal, and the police were therefore called.
A car theft was also reported in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a moment, and she was then taken away.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Glee Squad - The Terrible Fate of the Glee Stars
The theory has spread on the Internet that a curse rests on the series about the Glee Squad, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third main actor of the series to die far too early.
Glee is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series dealt with the so-called cheerleading squad of teenagers in high school, their loves and fate.
It wasn&#39;t always easy to be in the cheerleading squad, but through song and dance, the characters of the show seemed to be able to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the filming location, great disasters have befallen the actors and employees of the shows, so much so that theories have arisen that the shows are cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who didn&#39;t call everything her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
Last July 8, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone adrift in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had gone swimming and that Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there herself.
An extensive search for Rivera was launched.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that during the search, it was assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she ran into a strong current in the water and used her last request to save her son.
The cause of death was listed as accidental drunkenness.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of an angel who played a key role in bringing the Cheerleaders to fame and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough was enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and everything seemed to be looking up.
Just two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed to be an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for narcotics had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his co-stars, but at the urging of his co-star, Lea Michele, the series was decided to continue filming and they dedicated an entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah &quot;Puck&quot; Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Glee Squad, or until he worked up the courage to admit that he enjoyed it to sing and dance.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search of his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found, and the matter was soon publicly investigated.
It was clear that Salling had already been.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to be on the sex offender registry and seek treatment for pedophiles.
Before the judge could determine the sentence, Salling, who was out on bail at the time, was found dead near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It wasn&#39;t just the actors of the shows who passed away long ago.
Jim Fuller was the show&#39;s assistant director.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, aged just 41.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not have a good story with her sister, but she accused Roberts of being very controlling and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014 after struggling with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiance in which she said that her mother and sister, among others, were responsible for how she was treated.
&quot;My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression.&quot;
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and abusing her co-stars on set and wearing outrageous star styles.
Jesse Luken guest-starred on the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a big scandal.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the series.
In 2010, she was exposed to unscrupulous hackers getting nude photos of her and publishing them on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the series and had an off-screen romance.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner abused her during the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
It enhances children&#39;s development when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents, grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
You can also do endless things with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the scent and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
&quot;I don&#39;t think there are many fishermen who work in preschools in the country,&quot; says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who does beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Beach fishing is a very convenient summer activity when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income, and I think it&#39;s great to be able to avoid taking out student loans.
The income will also last me well into the winter,&quot; says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is beach fishing this summer, just like in previous summers.
Axel had just docked at Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught up with him late at night at the beginning of the week.&quot;
&quot;The winter I was in tenth grade, I took my pilot&#39;s license for boats under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have been shore fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used from an acquaintance of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat,&quot; says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
&quot;I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
I therefore had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.&quot;
But how could a guy have a million and a half to pay for a boat when he had just finished primary school?
&quot;I had made a deposit and saved up money, I had been working with my father to the sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him every summer and I got my share.
I also put my loading money into my boat fund.&quot;
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother&#39;s family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
&quot;I can fish here in the western area because I have legal residence with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these areas in the west from rowing with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Vestfjorden.
Although I prefer to be in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I&#39;ve also fished in the south, but it&#39;s mainly gray bream,&quot; says Axel, who always fishes early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in solitude for hours out on the sea.
&quot;The internet connection at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don&#39;t mind being alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting into accidents, but there have certainly been occasional weather problems, but never a big danger,&quot; says Axel, who is lucky in that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
&quot;In coastal fishing, I&#39;m never fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I&#39;ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I&#39;ve been out for a continuous day and a half fishing out at sea. &quot;
He says that the arrangement in coastal fishing is such that he can catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds inhibiting.
&quot;Other restrictions are that I can&#39;t fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, during the four months of inshore fishing, May, June, July and August.
In my opinion fishermen should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to make their own choices.
So the zoning could also go for me, and sea areas that are well located near the fishing should be able to enjoy it,&quot; says Axel, who mostly catches cod from salty seas during his coastal fishing, but also only roach and occasional other species float along.
Axel works during the winter with the university program at the nursery school Núpi in Kópavogur.
&quot;I don&#39;t think there are many fishermen who work in kindergartens in the country,&quot; says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
&quot;I got stuck there because I think it&#39;s an awesome job.
I hope that the psychology course will be useful to me at the kindergarten level in the future,&quot; says Axel, who is also well advanced in business studies.
An error in the registration prevented a homecoming sepsis
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country meant that a person living in Iceland was not called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to register a social security number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
&quot;This will be examined this week,&quot; says an expert at the Department of Epidemiology of the National Health Service.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at Landspítal&#39;s virology department yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in Iceland on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called repatriation hygiene came into effect.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and invited again for sampling four to five days later.
It was stated in RÚV&#39;s midday news that the person had, however, followed the old system.
The sampling at the border was negative and he was not called back to be screened for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert at the Department of Epidemiology of the National Health Service, says in an interview with a news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter a social security number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on return home infection even though they filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people for sampling again after they arrived in the country.
&quot;This will be examined this week, how it is possible to facilitate people&#39;s access to this, to draw their attention to the process.&quot;
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go for sampling, but two had started to show symptoms.
Infection tracking is currently underway for the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is mostly complete due to the two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing by Icelandic Genetics has revealed that there are variants of the corona virus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the links have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation according to the website COVID. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in this country in recent days.
Of them, four are completely unrelated and the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been found.
Infection tracking is still ongoing.
Originally, thirty were individually sent to quarantine, but their number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 are in quarantine due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager at the public safety department of the National Police Commissioner, says it is possible, as long as people follow the norms and rules.
&quot;We are constantly urging everyone who lives here that it is necessary to maintain individual prevention of infection.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that must be followed.
Then you can hold an event,&quot; says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual prevention of infection.
Rules and standards are also under constant review.
&quot;What needs to be done, and what the Public Safety Department and the National Health Service are constantly urging people to do, is to pay attention to these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the spread of infection,&quot; says Jóhann.
&quot;We need to urge people to continue on the good path we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far.&quot;
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard over the phone how her father was struggling to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to a corona virus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen to him.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield&#39;s fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by the US authorities show that almost 40% of those who have died had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage rises to half.
The study by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the corona virus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Was hidden in slow growth Reuters commissioned a survey and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have not yet begun reporting the underlying disease.
&quot;Diabetes was already a slow growing epidemic.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like the forces of the ages,&quot; Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American origin, who have also been worse off by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control through exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of a healthcare professional.
However, the corona virus epidemic has made it difficult for many people to maintain a routine.
Also, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue coming to work and thereby risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that US authorities must have been aware of the danger that those with type 2 diabetes could pose to the virus.
When the SARS corona virus passed in 2003, over 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS first hit in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may last longer, the epidemic has uncovered a number of previously unknown complications.
&quot;I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over,&quot; says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the corona virus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
New research also points to the fact that the corona virus may lead to an increase in the number of diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high ratio of glucose to lipids in diabetics can cause a real &quot;cell signaling storm&quot;, as it is called when the immune system reacts too strongly and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a fatal blood clot.
&quot;It&#39;s all one big puzzle,&quot; says Dela Cruz.
&quot;It&#39;s all interconnected.&quot;
The news has been corrected.
&quot;We were offered champagne, then they left the room&quot;
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason accepted the unusual request from the visual artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
&quot;We loved each other so it wasn&#39;t complicated.&quot;
Atli Bollason will never forget the first time he met his wife and mother, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir.
&quot;I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiance, but I also thought it was incredibly cute.
And still do,&quot; he says.
Ásrún remembers this too, as her husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
&quot;I keep hearing this story.
Last just this weekend,&quot; she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first meeting.
&quot;I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.
There&#39;s a lot going on and a lot happening, and I was fascinated by that.&quot;
Atli says the couple has emphasized going their own way in their relationship.
&quot;We don&#39;t tie our bags in the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we detect around us.&quot;
That is possibly the reason why they received the message from artist Ragnar Kjartansson with joy, although it was unusual to say the least.
&quot;Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ragnar&#39;s wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps.&quot;
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he planned to stage at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this fall.
&quot;He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.&quot;
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
&quot;He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and at the end he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in being involved.&quot;
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
&quot;It&#39;s intercourse with a beginning and an end,&quot; says Atli.
The couple didn&#39;t know Ragnar much, although they knew about him and he about them, &quot;but they knew us and thought we fit into this.&quot;
They had a word that they didn&#39;t want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn&#39;t get the right people, but people who would get sexual pleasure from performing for others.&quot;
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn&#39;t take long.
&quot;When we walked away from Snaps, we said, &#39;Aren&#39;t we just for this?&#39;
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,&quot; says Ásrún, and Atli agrees.
&quot;It&#39;s about love and intimacy&quot;
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargatan.
There was a very small film crew; cameraman, Ragnar and soundman and the couple.
After the recording had been switched on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
&quot;We hadn&#39;t decided anything about how we should be.
We received some small instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn&#39;t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn&#39;t complicated,&quot; says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
&quot;Yes, it was a bit romantic,&quot; says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
&quot;We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.&quot;
The team was pleased with the couple&#39;s performance in the piece that moved them.
&quot;When Tommi Tukmaður looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,&quot; says Atli.
&quot;It&#39;s as much about love and intimacy as intercourse itself,&quot; says Ásrún.
The couple&#39;s parents have seen the piece and tells Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the piece.
&quot;Then she turns around and starts thinking about it,&quot; says Atli.
&quot;Mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn&#39;t told anyone about it like that, but then my dad just sends me a message and says: Nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo,&quot; recalls Ásrún.
And did the participation in the work deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?
&quot;At least we&#39;re still together so maybe it deepened something.&quot;
At least this deepened my relationship with my in-laws,&quot; says Ásrún, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
&quot;I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but with someone else,&quot; she says, turning to her husband.
&quot;But it was nice to see this because it&#39;s just one scene in a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works, it&#39;s really cool.&quot;
I was able to break away from it a bit and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach,&quot; says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple&#39;s second child when the scene was filmed.
&quot;It was just beautiful.&quot;
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrúna and Atla in Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea with a win in the first semi-final
Swansea beat Brentford 1-0 in a dramatic game.
This was the first match between the teams in the semi-finals of the play-off for promotion to the English Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea&#39;s home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0-0.
The home team in Swansea received a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew missed the arc from the penalty spot and made a save.
Just two minutes later, Brentford&#39;s Rico Henry received a red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the match with one less man and in the 82nd minute the Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then made up for the penalty blunder by scoring a superb goal to secure a 1–0 win for Swansea.
Swansea therefore leads the head-to-head 1-0, with the second leg taking place next Wednesday at Brentford&#39;s home ground.
Ambassador-free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador to this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as US ambassador at the end of April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under peculiar circumstances, but Kastlós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the president&#39;s office saying that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst&#39;s successor took office, in September 2010.
It can be attributed to some extent to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then withdrew.
The job was finally taken over by Loius Ariega, who had then worked in the foreign service for decades.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then another ambassador-free period began.
Robert Barber was approved by the US Congress in January 2015 and took office soon after, after 13 months without an ambassador.
Barber was a political appointee and not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama&#39;s campaign fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office, on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
Therefore, two years passed until the US Congress summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to question him and then confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by the Dutch rock.
Gunter is a political appointee, a former dermatologist in California, and a prominent figure in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but at that time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest period in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration took to appoint people to key positions, as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been very slow, including confirming ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been a total of five years without an ambassador in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is believed to have cost around 6.5 billion, but thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player suffered racism in Iceland - &quot;It was a mistake to come to Iceland&quot;
Tonny Mawejje, a former ÍBV player, says he was exposed to racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC who play in Uganda&#39;s top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot of things, including his time in Iceland where he played with ÍBV, Val and Þrótti in Iceland.
&quot;When I came to Iceland, I didn&#39;t play in the middle like I used to.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn&#39;t get either of what I wanted,&quot; says Tonny, who played on the right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among the things Tonny discusses is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players face when playing in Europe.
&quot;It happened to me once, but since I didn&#39;t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.&quot;
Later I learned about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He then told me that my opponent made racist comments about me after I tackled him.&quot;
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the mistake he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
&quot;It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think that if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted,&quot; says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland ended his dreams of joining a big team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman&#39;s throat
Doctors at St. Luke&#39;s International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who went there.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with forceps.
An investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat, a few days earlier.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi made its way to the West, the number of cases where parasites have been transmitted to people has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now the focus of concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, but the government there has taken measures to curb the spread of the corona virus again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, just like in Norway, and the French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, as governments try to strike a balance between containing the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but the incidence of infections worldwide approaches 300 thousand per day, with the highest number of infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have reached 644,000.
Gerðar&#39;s mosaic work can finally be enjoyed to its fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík there is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is open and many people now stop and admire a work of art made of millions of mosaic tiles - like they have never seen it before.
Maybe they&#39;ve never seen it before.
At least not considered so.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking lots that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their errands in the city center.
&quot;Vibrant and diverse public spaces&quot; and &quot;attractive urban flair&quot; are the guiding principles for the reconstruction of Tryggvagatan, which is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerðar Helgadottir&#39;s mosaic work at the Customs House to be better enjoyed.
There will be a square in front of the project, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a recreation area for passers-by.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material can now be enjoyed better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
The area will also feature small &quot;mist sprinklers&quot;, a kind of water sculpture, which offer play and give the area a certain sense of mystery.
This is how the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is in charge of the construction together with Veit.
The water, heating and electricity pipes will be renewed.
Many of them are old, but the sewage pipes and cold water pipes date from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive on it again.
But it will be a one-way street and at the same time a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians will be created.
In information about the Customs House on the website of the customs authority, it is said that the building was put into use in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because harbor damage reached through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface facing the street was created.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a bad effect on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to embellish the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art installed there.
During this time Gerðir Helgadóttir, an artist, became very famous, says the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the port, since the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was taken aback by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again, as she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some proposals for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to conclude a comprehensive contract with her and the famous art company in Germany, Bræðurna Oidtmann, but Gerður had worked with them for a long time on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Agreements were reached and Gerður worked on the artwork under installation in the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation at the Customs House.
The entire work was done exceptionally well, both by Gerðar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Ever since then, it has withstood the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerðr about two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollhús work was completed, aged only 47.
Prepares the transfer of more institutions abroad
Social Affairs Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public institutions will be moved abroad in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the program Sprengisandi á Bylgjuninn at noon.
It was recently announced that the fire department of the Housing and Civil Service Agency will be moved north to Sauðárkrók this fall.
Six experts in the field of fire work at the institute, but none of them intend to follow the institute north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Servicemen has criticized the relocation.
&quot;I think we should take a further step into this being.&quot;
I am preparing further steps into this being.
More transportation,&quot; said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
&quot;I think it is necessary to make further political decisions about the transfer of public functions to the country, like I was doing with the Housing and Infrastructure Agency,&quot; said Ásmundur, but he also gave examples of other institutions that have been moved abroad and made a big difference to communities outside the country, such as the relocation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Landmæring Íslands to Akraness and unemployment insurance to Skagaströnd.
All the highlights from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Icelandic Championships in freestyle athletics ended at Þórsvelli in Akureyri today.
Several tournament records were set on the second day of competition.
An exciting competition in the women&#39;s hammer throw was expected at Þórsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Icelandic hammer throw record in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in bad shape lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record so far this summer.
Elizabet Rut has been struggling with an injury and did not make it to the finish line today.
She had just one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record, which she set earlier in July, is 62.69 meters, and she was therefore quite far from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men&#39;s category, FH&#39;s Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Icelandic record holder in the hammer throw, won safely, but he threw 73.84 meters in his penultimate throw and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympian and Icelandic record holder in the shot put, won the shot put competition at Þórsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in the shot put, which is his main discipline.
Guðna Val&#39;s Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest today 59.13 meters and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in the long jump, won the long jump competition with an advantage, but Hafdís jumped the farthest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women&#39;s 200 meter run, it was the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, but she finished in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meter race and in the 4 x 100 meter relay and then also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men&#39;s category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish in the 200 meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Not fined for 27 million ISK Bitcoin harvest
The Supreme Tax Committee has rejected the claim of the tax investigation director who demanded a fine against a man for under-declaring his capital income, which was generated from the sale of the electronic coin Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the tax investigator had not given a clear argument why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee&#39;s ruling states that the tax investigation director considered the man to have submitted materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have under-reported his capital income from the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin of 27 million, either on purpose or through gross negligence.
The man should be fined for his behavior.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he admitted that in 2016 he sold electronic coins for 27 million.
He would have acquired her through burial in the years 2009 and 2010, when this would have been both easy and inexpensive with an ordinary home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the electronic coins, the tax treatment for such a sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such measures on their tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have reported his property on the tax return as a deposit in a foreign currency account.
He had asked both experts and the tax authorities how this could be done, but to no avail.
He also believed that it was necessary to take into account the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarize himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore believed it was right that his taxes for these two income years would be re-determined and a surcharge applied, but otherwise no penalty would be imposed.
He then reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to shirk his duties by improper means.
The demand for a fine would be out of proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur makes headlines: &quot;This man understands what football is about&quot;
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has quite a bit between the teeth of people, but also impressed because of his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max league.
There will be flashes in the line of fire tonight when they take on ÍA live on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a suspension due to four reminders during the season and therefore does not show up for the game with a new haircut, as in the games of the summer so far.
He had had &quot;blah, blah, blah&quot; written on his forehead before last Thursday&#39;s game against HK, which HK won 1-0.
&quot;I don&#39;t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one had better try in the game.&quot;
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to tie this game, I thought he would do it or create it,&quot; said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when Brynjólfi was counted.
&quot;I&#39;m supposed to be here for the people.&quot;
&quot;It is sometimes difficult to understand what position he is in.&quot;
&quot;He looks a bit out on the left side when the games are going on, but he has a very free role in the team,&quot; said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is happy to have such a colorful man in the department: &quot;No one disputes that this is a character.
She is a fun type and I love it with her hair, and always being ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people busy with him, which tells me that this man understands what football is.
&quot;I&#39;m an entertainer.
I&#39;m supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.&quot;
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what happens next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,&quot; said Máni.
The KR player says he wants to leave the club - &quot;I have been in contact with several teams in the B league&quot;
Tobias Thomsen, KR&#39;s player in the Pepsi Max league, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but for that he must first cancel his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding,&quot; said Tobias in an interview with Bold.
&quot;I have been in contact with several teams in the B league and will probably switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay off my contract at KR.&quot;
He then says that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
&quot;Companies in Denmark have probably felt the economic effects of the virus more than in Iceland.&quot;
Bjartmar, the bike whisperer, has recovered a bike worth millions - now answers for himself after DV&#39;s coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs out and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name &quot;bike whisperer&quot; as a result.
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a man published an account of his relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Vesturbæinga Facebook group, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man in Austurvelli and said that the scooter was possibly stolen.
It was only possible to read from the electric shuttle man&#39;s original writings that Bjartmar had accused him of being a thief.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the initial news about the case is not descriptive at all of what really happened yesterday at Austurvelli.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from a victim of an electric shuttle theft that it was indeed his electric shuttle.
The alleged owner got that information from someone else, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
&quot;I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, having information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to give it a shot and talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I&#39;m very good at things like this, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word away.&quot;
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
&quot;Yes, cool,&quot; said Bjartmar, &quot;let&#39;s just get this straight.&quot;
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been practicing this practice, he says he can count the number of times he&#39;s run afoul of people on the fingers of one hand.
&quot;I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík,&quot; said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
&quot;Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal,&quot; says Bjartmar.
&quot;My relations with these people are really so good that I have many of those good people on my team.
There are examples of people who have gone to treatment and taken care of themselves and then come to me and help me with what I&#39;m doing,&quot; he says.
In general, Bjartmar&#39;s relations with cyclists are polite.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, bike serial numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV&#39;s previous reporting and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he has not reached a slippery slope with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that it certainly is.
&quot;Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing this.
For example, I have watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is quite frankly powerless in these matters.&quot;
&quot;When the cops aren&#39;t doing anything about it, and it&#39;s right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can be successful in this case, why not?&quot; asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has been so successful in tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he comes across his &quot;clients&quot; on the street, and they just have the Bjartmari bikes that they had previously recovered.
The times that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police, it has happened that they simply do not show up.
&quot;It&#39;s just not working with the police, and it&#39;s not my fault and it&#39;s not the owners of the bikes,&quot; said Bjartmar, and it&#39;s a pity that the victims of bike theft have to suffer from the police&#39;s indifference in this matter.
There is no dispute about Bjartmar&#39;s success.
In many places you can find stories of people thanking Bjartmari for getting their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are of course in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles weigh heavily there, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a condominium.
His bike quest is therefore an unpaid job he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
The year 2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had received pensions from the Danish King all the way back to the 19th century, but in 1919 a civil servants&#39; pension fund was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all civil servants.
The foundation for the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid with general collective bargaining agreements in the labor market in 1969, which stipulated employment-related pension funds with mandatory membership and fully valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed based on these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The workers&#39; pension system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century forced through its struggle for wages.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also gradually won their demands for sick pay and health insurance, significant holiday rights, shorter working hours, housing reform and other important matters.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much greater and more permanent wage improvement than the increase in the number of ounces in the wage envelope, which disappeared just as hard in the heat of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until the 1990s, as many remember.
The lead-up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would in practice be the property of fund members, the trade union movement had to agree that their boards should be made up of representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the following years after the foundation of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the workers&#39; organizations, but it never came to fruition, and therefore we are still left with the unnatural arrangement that representatives of fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
In Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in number 1 that &quot;the pension fund shall have the interests of fund members as its guiding principle.&quot;
Paragraph 5 also states: &quot;A pension fund shall set ethical standards for investments.&quot;
The shareholders&#39; policy of the Shopkeepers&#39; Pension Fund includes the following provisions, in continuation of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investments (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and Europe.
The rules discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment performance of securities portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a wider context are aligned.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: maintaining good governance, working conditions, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest funds in the country, has adopted a &quot;policy on responsible investments&quot; and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all reviewed here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, &quot;shadow management&quot;.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not expected that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now &quot;the most accepted&quot;: Shadow management is when a leader in a union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the company to the board pension fund&#39;s recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position in a specific matter.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader doesn&#39;t take this to the media and doesn&#39;t talk about dismissal, it&#39;s not &quot;shadow management&quot;, because of course, this kind of communication between people always happens in the financial world, just like anywhere else.
I&#39;ll leave it up to the reader to decide which way they think is more &quot;shady.&quot;
There are two people in particular who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, journalist at Fréttablaðin and Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the central bank.
The reason for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company&#39;s contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Reykjavík Business Association, then sent out that recommendation to the company&#39;s board members The shopkeepers&#39; pension fund not to support the fund&#39;s possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Þór followed the same path with his recommendations, which of course were based on Bogi&#39;s decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to talk about the issue in the Fréttablaðinn&#39;s Friday issue with big words about shadow management, breaking the law and the great need for changes in the law.
There, a small tufa was indeed to overturn a heavy head, even though the blessed tufa had been in the mode of attachment and, moreover, had been quickly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let&#39;s consider the topic itself at the end.
I outlined above the points in the law on pension funds that pertain to this matter.
They include that fund boards must protect the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of association of both Gildis and the Shopkeepers&#39; Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and you don&#39;t have to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to unscrupulous adventurers and environmental waste, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on the edge of his seat when he thought of wiping out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he noticed and retracted it.
Time will tell if it is enough for the pension fund&#39;s investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes down to it.

One of the infected people did not use an antiseptic when they returned home
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic states on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, does not live here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions about maintaining the so-called return home hygiene after arriving in the country and taking another sample a few days after arrival.
He tested negative at the border.
&quot;But he is in Icelandic society and he should actually go to that resort,&quot; says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert in the epidemiologist at the National Health Service and deputy epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
&quot;He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second sample.&quot;
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he actually lives abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used the Icelandic one.
However, he did not realize this.
&quot;When the social security number is not registered, you have to try to come to the second sampling yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way,&quot; says Kamilla.
&quot;So it is clear that we need to strengthen the provision of information about this while we find some way to make an automatic notification system even though Icelanders do not register their social security number.
Or to somehow make it more obvious who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system,&quot; she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question had few contacts upon arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent to quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to go for sampling, but two of them have started to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says that it is likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to identify him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland and did not bring the virus with him to the country.
&quot;It is not entirely possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sports tournament. &quot;
She says that is very unlikely because of how few people socialized here.
&quot;It&#39;s really very unlikely,&quot; says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in humans.
&quot;If we get a type of virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he brought it to the country.&quot;
Pepper spray and bombs were used against protesters
Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades on the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protest in Seattle was in support of the protestors in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in a peaceful protest.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city&#39;s courthouse.
As a result, the police declared the protest to be a riot, and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and the police.
Demand justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police last August, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in formations to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who were protesting the protest and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to exaggerate the importance of today&#39;s match with Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men will finish in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
However, they would still hope to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
&quot;We have not reached the end.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven&#39;t had a bad season,&quot; said Solskjær.
&quot;But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to catch the two teams above us,&quot; said Solskjær.
It is clear that people&#39;s nerves will be tense at 15 today but Solskjær tried to pretend it was any other game.
&quot;If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on this.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it&#39;s up to us to take advantage of it,&quot; said Solskjær.
&quot;It&#39;s not the most important game of the season, it&#39;s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don&#39;t define our season, we&#39;ve already had a lot of moments that define this season.&quot;
&quot;The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season,&quot; said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per solar cycle
65,490 new infections of the corona virus were detected in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days before that, there were more than 1,000 deaths from the virus per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
It is stated in a CNN report that according to a prediction model by the United States epidemic prevention authorities, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15.
Fearing a second wave of the epidemic
The government in Spain is now desperately trying to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been diagnosed there in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to undergo quarantine upon return.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain&#39;s list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia, in the north-east of Spain, where the government has introduced wider restrictions to try to curb the growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and pubs will be forced to close at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in the county of Segria in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is doing badly after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK&#39;s largest travel agency, canceled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments in many parts of the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to a large-scale curfew that has devastated the economy in many places.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken this very seriously and compared it to nuclear weapons, which he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has also said that the nation &quot;would not survive, economically or socially,&quot; if a nationwide curfew were to be imposed again.
Many leaders hope that local measures that reach the residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to contain the virus in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestically
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, plus two more at the border.
Thus, five persons were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In the announcement of the civil defense, one of the infections is related to the infection that was reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen people who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was involved in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and, according to the announcement, &quot;only part of the sports team&quot; is in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine are related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undiscovered and infection tracing is in full swing by the National Police Commissioner&#39;s infection tracing team.
The tournament organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the instructions and rules of the epidemiologist and public safety that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures from yesterday&#39;s tournament attracted attention, where you could see a very close community celebrating the good performance of their team out on the field.
Just before 11am today, the tournament organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says &quot;NOTE: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff from school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.&quot;
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection that was reported the day before.
The announcement says: &quot;Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus has been discovered that has not been detected here before.&quot;
Work is being done on infection tracing in that case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him are in quarantine.
Two of them have already started to show symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border, and the results of further investigations are awaited, as stipulated by the procedure for cross-border infections.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Police Commissioner&#39;s Department of Public Safety and the Office of the National Medical Examiner urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infection control.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go to the nearest health center for sampling.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the shopping weekend - Directs visitors elsewhere
The campsite at Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to Vesturbyggðar&#39;s announcement.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Mentions Vesturbyggð Bíldudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
There is plenty to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the attendance at the campsite, a good turnout can be expected this year, if the weather doesn&#39;t put a damper on the calculation, but DV said earlier today about a far-fetched forecast.
However, the worst weather to the south can be expected, and hope for Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is reported first, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building decays in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking a building permit for renovations, but their case has been stuck in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavík, there is a beautiful apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building there is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house there are doors to two stairwells, each of which contains four fairly decent apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The house has quite a history.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, housed a video rental, Skóstofuna, Mjólkursamsalunn&#39;s dairy, Jóa gunsmith, a fishmonger and most recently Háskólprent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its beauty.
The house is now heavily damaged, as you can see in the attached photos.
The owner of the building is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 ehf. According to the company register, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir are among others.
Magnús led Borgun&#39;s ownership group and was the representative of Borgun&#39;s holding company.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of one third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the Stálskip shipping company.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and therefore little or nothing has been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the building has steadily worsened since then, but mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the building &quot;hasn&#39;t been very lively in recent years&quot;.
It may play a role in the fact that the owners have been looking to change the house and the plot for several years.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in order for a long time.
&quot;It&#39;s long overdue to do something proper about this spot and it&#39;s sad that it has dragged on like this.&quot;
He also says that he is mad at the building&#39;s owners for not hurrying to finish this, find some common ground with the building&#39;s neighbors and stop this &quot;legal jam&quot;.
&quot;Just do it in consultation with the surrounding community so it can be rushed and finished.&quot;
The &quot;legal quagmire&quot; the resident refers to is the plot&#39;s planning process, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Decision Committee, and the committee annulled it because the project was not supported by local planning and the neighborhood promotion was not adequate.
The City of Reykjavík then started with local planning work and finished it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That organization was also challenged and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the building&#39;s owners were at the starting line.
By this time, the house had deteriorated considerably and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reactions of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Some directed their anger at the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone.
Still others called the parking lots a problem, but neighbors have used the unused parking lots at Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One of the applicants in the case said he was tired of the administration:
&quot;That we have to go through the process in three steps is quite incredible.
It&#39;s like the city of Reykjavík doesn&#39;t know how to read.&quot;
Today the building is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A monument to the slip rope of the city&#39;s administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work, which is now at the starting line.
When a journalist was carried to a yard at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by a gaping door and piles of trash.
A Playstation computer and a recent TV lay among other rubbish on the ground — victims of the Icelandic summer wetness.
The old office of Háskólprent was opened, and there were quite a few cats judging by the smell.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of couches and beds and a few pallets of geology pages, which were no doubt meant to become a book, were thrown around.
The staircases of the apartment building were also open and alive in both of them.
A journalist was lucky enough to come across a resident of one of them.
The Romanians were there cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the temporary agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and DV&#39;s sources claim that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the building, it is not considered justifiable to collect rent.
Judging by the piles of mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there in recent seasons.
Temporary agency operations have not been spared by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a recession in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient in making use of temporary agency services.
Nevertheless, the household members at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and their work overalls and mittens hung out in the communal area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the deplorable condition of the building, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavík, there is a dilapidated 1,500 square meter property.
The owners want to change the house for the better, and the neighbors want to improve the condition, but they dispute the definition of &quot;improved&quot;.
In between, the city&#39;s planning department sits at the starting line, a victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process, and the fleeting decision of the Environmental and Natural Resources Decision Committee.
Romanian workers live in the building, perhaps the very ones who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in DV&#39;s weekend magazine on July 17.
In an effort against obesity following the corona virus epidemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate £10 million to an anti-obesity campaign, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, after he fell seriously ill, partly because of his weight.
Johnson is set to launch the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, and with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight clients and will also be launched in an effort to increase the number of cycling paths.
Then, the advertisements of fast food places on television will be banned before 9 pm, according to sources in the British media.
&quot;Covid-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become fitter, more active and eat a healthier diet,&quot; a government spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the corona virus this spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step the nation can take towards greater decentralization, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
&quot;We need to change gears a bit now, and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that is more comfortable with these values.&quot;
It&#39;s women,&quot; said Helga.
&quot;Women in Iceland are famous for their women&#39;s solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it&#39;s just our turn to lead these changes.&quot;
She said she was a little worried about the emphasis on Iceland as &quot;the best in the world&quot; in both gender equality and human rights.
&quot;Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It&#39;s a lot.
We must know where we are coming from and know the history and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don&#39;t all live by the same rules here,&quot; said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways doing well in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders live by very masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around self-interest, dominance and power which were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
&quot;Women have now started this group and come together and are just a little annoyed that Alþingi is going to ignore this referendum from 2012,&quot; she said.
&quot;It is these feminine values from which we are thinking.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table,&quot; she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the basic values in the new constitution.
&quot;We are a very rich country with natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It&#39;s ridiculous, we can switch differently,&quot; said Helga.
&quot;It is ridiculous that it is some natural law that women&#39;s jobs are always paid less.
It&#39;s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to endlessly fight for wages just to get a decent salary.&quot;
You can sign the signature list for the new constitution here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian downtown
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlíðunur, where the driver was traveling at a speed of 146 km where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been disqualified from driving.
The police in the capital area had a lot to do last night and over 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There were also a lot of noise reports due to concerts.
On Saturday night, reports were received of eleven noisy gatherings, and it was considered a lot in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise cases were brought to the attention of the police.
Six were kept in a cell last night.
In Árbæn, the police were called last night when parties set off fireworks.
However, they had already escaped when the policemen came to the yard.
Then nine drivers were stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city center last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in Vesturbærn.
One was taken to the emergency department after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver pulling a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan&#39;s equipment was, according to the police log, in &quot;very poor condition&quot; and was impounded.
You can stay overnight in Monet&#39;s house during the shopping weekend
The house in which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his career is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the building are during the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandie, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
According to Airbnb&#39;s site, it&#39;s next available in a week, on the Sunday of Bank Holiday, so it might be ideal for some holiday shoppers to hurry and book the painter&#39;s house.
The two nights over the shopping weekend cost only 964 US dollars, or just over 130 thousand Icelandic krónur, as far as Fréttablaðið can tell.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the corona virus
Five people have been diagnosed with the corona virus domestically in the last three days, and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the corona virus within the country yesterday and two during border screening.
An expert at the Office of the National Medical Examiner says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
&quot;It has been sequenced since the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now,&quot; said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the quarantine department of the Office of the National Medical Examiner.
Most of those infected have been in contact with persons who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but several people who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of the corona virus.
&quot;Right now there is no flu and other respiratory tract infections are less common, so we can be quite liberal with doing these tests on people who, during the flu season, would have found a reason to do something else first,&quot; said Kamilla.
Infection tracing is mostly over, but it is not excluded that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is defensible to hold such events.
The communications director of the public defense says that it is possible as long as people follow the norms and rules.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible for the infected to have been infected at the sports tournaments.
&quot;If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after interacting with them at these sports tournaments, we can claim that our quarantine at the tournaments has worked.
But that has not been revealed,&quot; said Kamilla.
The procedure of the Public Defense Department is under constant review.
&quot;We need to be ready to step in with further advice or restrictions if it seems warranted,&quot; Kamilla said.
In a little over a week, the number restrictions will be extended to a thousand people.
This new status could affect concessions.
&quot;Cooking is a certain meditation&quot; - See Elísa Viðar&#39;s menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished soccer player and plays with Val.
She is also a master&#39;s student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the daily grind and usually takes the time to cook good, nutritious food.
A normal day for me starts with arriving at work at eight o&#39;clock,&quot; says Elísa.
&quot;After work I go to the shop so I can prepare dinner before I pick up my girl from kindergarten at around three o&#39;clock.&quot;
Elisa finds it very nourishing to pick her daughter up early for kindergarten.
&quot;It&#39;s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After training, it&#39;s good to come home and just have to heat up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one show to clear our minds.&quot;
Elisa does not follow any specific diet.
She is putting the finishing touches on her master&#39;s thesis in nutrition and therefore knows exactly what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy for work, school, family and exercise.
&quot;What works for me is to eat a variety of foods that are well-composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or not nutritious.
It&#39;s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.&quot;
Elísa is very interested in cooking.
&quot;I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking, and therefore draw a lot from it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a decent cook.&quot;
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave to soak in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal off with what&#39;s available at any time.
Most of the time it&#39;s banana and crunchy muesli &amp; COFFEE.
I&#39;m a big coffee drinker.
In between: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that&#39;s the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of hearty salads from what&#39;s in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing are a bit of what I&#39;m working with.
If the organization gets completely out of control (which happens often), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often, and then it&#39;s 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and a boiled egg, don&#39;t worry about it anymore.
Intermediate: Get something high in carbohydrates before training, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
City officials in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of riot following mass protests in the city center.
Yesterday, the police resorted to flares and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that the protesters conquered and stretched over many blocks in the vicinity of the parliament building in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into a vandalism attack on a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that the protesters stoned the police with stones, bottles, firecrackers and other loose objects, and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were treated.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were called to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, a city that has repeatedly seen violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed forces of federal law enforcement.
There, like in other American cities, people are gathering under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding improvements.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the end of next month, will be revoked.
Electronic voting on the collective agreement of the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland on behalf of flight attendants at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the company&#39;s chairman, says she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs until the results of the vote are known.
&quot;This is clearly connected,&quot; says Guðlaug Líney.
&quot;No layoffs have been revoked, this must be established so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are impatient to find out if they will have a job after the end of the month.&quot;
The vote is on an agreement that was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously rejected in a vote.
On July 17, the board and the board of trustees of the Iceland Air Stewardess Association agreed to announce a general work stoppage at Icelandair, the members approved it in a vote.
It never happened, but this was decided following Icelandair&#39;s decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants Association, lay off all its flight attendants and seek contracts with another union.
Then the company&#39;s pilots were to temporarily take on the duties of security personnel on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it&#39;s hard to say.
&quot;People are hurt after this action by Icelandair, when all of the company&#39;s flight attendants were dismissed and informed that an agreement would be made with another union.
Now it will be seen if it has an effect,&quot; she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their notice period varies, for those with the shortest working life it is three months and ends at the end of July-August.
About 90% of Icelandair&#39;s flight attendants belong to that group.
What happens if the contract is not accepted?
&quot;Then we request continued discussions with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair&#39;s requirements.
If it is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants feel that they have gone too far.&quot;
Voting on the collective agreement is over and Icelandair will present its results for the second quarter tomorrow
Flight attendants voting on a new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair&#39;s results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company&#39;s income has dropped by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective bargaining agreement between the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those who can vote on the contract are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendant Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of Sunday, July 19, but the previous Friday, Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after flight attendants rejected the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Then, Icelandair had dismissed all the company&#39;s flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants must fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, but it has integrated provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can fly on one shift.
The contract was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many of the flight attendants interviewed by the news agency expressed their dissatisfaction with the contract.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted in order to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair&#39;s results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company&#39;s EBIT, its operating result before capital items and taxes, is negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic króna, according to preliminary operating results.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, but it said that the company&#39;s revenue amounted to about 60 million dollars in the quarter, or about 8.3 billion ISK.
Cash and cash equivalents were around 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion ISK.
Icelandair also aims to tender the company&#39;s share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to complete agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the aircraft manufacturer Boeing before the end of the month before the share offering.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
&quot;A new virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.&quot;
This is not something that has been simmering in this country,&quot; says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at Landspítal&#39;s department of infectious diseases, about the reports that a &quot;new type of virus&quot; has been detected in this country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports club during the soccer tournament Rey Cup, but the source of the infection has not been found and infection tracing is ongoing.
Infection was also detected in a person who arrived in Iceland on July 15, and two people who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then an infection was detected yesterday that is related to an infection that was reported the day before, and after sequence analysis by the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was revealed &quot;a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.&quot;
Infection tracing has been completed in relation to that infection.
Már states that it is not a new virus, but that it is the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new corona virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could indicate that a second wave of the epidemic has started, Már says that at the moment it is a single case and it could end up being nothing more.
&quot;But on the other hand, if there are domestic cases that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is premature at the moment,&quot; explains Már .
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC presenters lead the way in a fun video highlighting the country&#39;s pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique on a global scale and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal heat is its basis, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children&#39;s swimming lessons were made compulsory by law in 1940, but senior citizens are no less adept at using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming trips are described as an integral part of the country&#39;s general well-being.
In the pool, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free from their mobile phones, people talk privately about home and space or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditate and recharge the batteries of soul and body.
It&#39;s steep to get a hundred days to the elections
There are one hundred days until the Americans go to the polls and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he has an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, has a large lead over Trump nationally, according to opinion polls.
According to a new AP poll, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump&#39;s response to the new corona virus pandemic is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump&#39;s response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March that percentage was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden&#39;s approval rating is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump&#39;s approval rating is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance in the face of the epidemic to Biden, fueling so-called cultural disputes and announcing policy issues that should be about law and order.
However, Biden&#39;s candidacy is putting a lot of effort into keeping the attention on Trump and believe there is a high probability of winning if the election is really about how Trump has done his job in the last four years.
Trump&#39;s unpopularity also seems set to come down on Republican congressmen, and progressives fear that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the United States Senate, which has so far been considered very promising.
Politico reported the other day that if party and candidate support remained similar to what it is now, the Republican Party would receive its biggest defeat in decades.
Suburbs proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it looks like that trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburbanites into following him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and encourage racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has rescinded an ordinance from Barack Obama&#39;s time in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then encouraged the &quot;housewives&quot; of America&#39;s suburbs to read an article by the former deputy governor of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy America&#39;s suburbs, and Trump agreed.
&quot;Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.&quot;
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
America&#39;s suburbanites are an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who received the majority of this group&#39;s votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney got the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that, despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has shrunk significantly.
Although it varies between polls, Biden has recently been holding a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the suburbs.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have affected until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be &quot;the light at the end of the tunnel&quot;, presumably referring to the corona virus pandemic that the rest of the world is currently going through. together.
High achievers have an extra year to prepare, and Japanese authorities are picking up costs for the delay.
However, everyone keeps their heads as the stakes are high.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan would be the venue for this year&#39;s Olympic Games, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the Games in 2016, but was defeated this time by Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the world&#39;s attention.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed by a year and will instead start on July 23, 2021 and end on August 8.
If the Games cannot be held then, if the corona virus becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
However, no one really wants to think that thought through.
The Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee&#39;s assessment of the cities&#39; presentations.
The grander the presentation - the more likely it is to get the nod.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to be allowed to hold the 2016 Olympic Games, or roughly 20 billion ISK.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion ISK on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country&#39;s infrastructure to handle such tournaments, prepare for them and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be held these days but have been postponed for a year due to the corona virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
In a report from the state auditor in Japan that was published at the end of last year, however, it was stated that the cost was almost double that number.
It will probably not be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all the tax revenue of the Icelandic state would only be enough for almost half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the topic of discussion for economists, who try to scrutinize the numbers and examine the benefits and profits of the Games.
In short, quite a few people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of the cities that host them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs increases greatly in the short-term, but in the long-term, cities often end up with a tail of debt and the alarmingly high operating costs of little-used structures.
Rio, Brazil is saddled with significant debt for the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
Figures have been scrutinized after the London 2012 Games, but it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out particularly well financially from hosting the Olympics because of the steep costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, a benefit is often seen as an increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which, however, is highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to receive all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities receive from being chosen, but it is difficult to put a monetary value on it.
Because despite the huge costs, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of such a nature that you can put a price tag on it.
But even though the show is often magnificent and there is no saving anywhere, it is of course not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some achievers, putting off the games is accidentally just welcome.
The Australian pentathlon woman and gold medalist in her event at the last Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, is skinny and would have been far from good fun this summer, but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are quite happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year&#39;s Games, had they been held in time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means they will retire before the Games take place.
Just don&#39;t trust your body to go through another year of rigorous training.
Few athletes captured the hearts of viewers at the 2016 Rio Olympics as thoroughly as gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in her native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to go to the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old by then.
Although not generally considered an old age, it is on the higher side for a top-ranked gymnast.
&quot;It&#39;s a sensitive issue,&quot; says Biles, but smiles otherwise in an interview published on the Olympic Committee&#39;s Instagram page when asked if she intends to go as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll still be on top after another year of training,&quot; says Biles.
She has previously spoken about her body not being able to withstand the stress of gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop working out at the height of the pandemic and the gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles any more than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic golds could not buy any entry above the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic shape is certainly a bit better than most people&#39;s.
&quot;We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start working out again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we are back in full swing and I will gradually increase the training as the year progresses.
Of course, we don&#39;t know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still train assuming that they will be, we can&#39;t help it.
&quot;I&#39;ve put in too much effort to leave the sport now,&quot; says Biles.
With her, like many others, there is a doubt or perhaps rather an awareness that a situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation of the corona virus pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics considering that they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the corona virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
&quot;I think there are other more important things to think about right now,&quot; the actress told People.
&quot;We really want to get married someday and have the wedding of our dreams and have everyone present who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what is important right now and that is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more into world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world.&quot;
