This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reports details that could not give fossils — for example, color and three-dimensional image.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with the lower part of pale or carotenoid color.
The discovery also provides an understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed rod, known as bachelor, but there are other features of the feathers — the perverts — the researchers concluded that ranks probably evolved much later than these other features.
From the structure of feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for beauty. Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage rather than the fluff of chicken.

Uka's weapon gave a misfire as he pointed it on the head of the fifth man. Schneider suffers from constant pain, blind in one eye, lost part of the skull, and his face was restored using titanium elements.
Schneider testified through a video link from the U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
In addition to the event held on Wednesday, Karpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championship.
It was her first salpar, where she received the status of "Not finished" in the first race. 36 of the 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In the second race from the giant slalom, she finished in the tenth position in the women's sitting group with a total time of 4:41.30 - at 2:11,60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Lesh, who finished in first place and at 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gionji Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of all 117 skiers did not take up any space in the supergiant slalom race.
The Madrid-Pradesh police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy General D. K. Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss and returned her stolen mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Visne Kangjar.
Police chief Chandra Shehar Solanki said the accused had appeared before the court with a closed face.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of these people were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency workers liberated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget's Hospital in Greyt-Jarmut.
He was subsequently transferred to the Addenbrook Clinic in Cambridge.
Adekoy was taken to the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of killing her son.
She is in custody and is awaiting prosecution and trial, but the testimony of any witness may be denied because her photo has often been published.
In other provinces of the UK, this is a common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts viewed the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists are obviously turning to a dangerous path by spreading photos and other data of suspects."
The office of the prosecutor, who is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that it would not provide any additional comments, at least until the charges.
This document, according to the leakage of information, will refer to the conflict around the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of the borders that existed before the war in the Middle East of 1967.
Other topics covered are likely to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the preservation of military presence in the valley for a decade after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Hunters in the auxiliary fight against pests had to be carefully controlled by rangers, because hunting was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with the NPP and the Australian Sports Rifleguers Association (ACCA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Hunting Program of the Sports Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flinn, c. The Director of Preservation of Parks and Heritage of the NSPDP, four arrows selected for the first shooting operation, received proper safety instructions and were trained.
Yesterday, Martellie was sworn in the new Temporary Electoral Council (TVR), consisting of nine members.
It is Martellie's fifth Temporary Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TEC, as part of the package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's response to large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by failure in holding elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iidobs were reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns in four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METP) said that they are aware of the 27 emergencies associated with these devices.
Last week, the METP announced that Apple had informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "unserious."
The ministry responded, calling the delay of Apple with the report "great sorrow."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (at 09:19 p.m. on Greenwich on Friday).
The emergency management of the Northern Mariana Islands informed that the country had not reported any damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of the tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage, stealing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists from his M16 rifle.
A few hostages were rescued. At least six hostages are currently being reported.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mandoza was shot dead.
Ligging went the way of his father and took up his medical career.
He was educated as an obstetrician-gynecologist and got a job at the Okland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua said that on Wednesday, state investigators seized two flight recorders (black boxes).
The fighters-colleagues also paid tribute to Luni.
Tommy Drimer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldast" Rannels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I...maybe even more...I love her and I will miss her...hope, she's in the best place."
From 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those against Australia became a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Giulia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the reign of Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the people who took part in the survey share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
If we consider categorical responses to surveys, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and take part in three relay races in the Commonwealth Games, but, given his complaints, doubts arose in his physical shape. 
He could not use pain medications, because they are prohibited when participating in Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a math specialist and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, found the most now-known simple number.  
Some people confirmed the discovery with the help of various hedges and software until the beginning of February, and this was reported on Tuesday.
Maybe comets were a source of supply to Earth water, as well as organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets have long encountered Earth.
Kumo, 53, became governor earlier this year, and last month signed a bill legitimizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity."
He is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the more outdated technology of the ground radar, which allows air traffic controllers to single out aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is launched and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking of motors and intercepting parking will not be available on the surface.
Fears due to lack of transportation made you think about playing behind closed doors without team fans.
The study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, reported the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer through the reproduction of the endemic clerk Darwin, Geospis Fortes, and the cacti yam-migrant zopali, Geospitez Conistrisis.
Gold can be given a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms. 
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and weaved. It can be hammered or rolled into letters.
It can be made very thin and pasted on another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books, which are called "iluminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. The indicator can be created using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or the main (alkaline) is the chemical.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two powders by rotating them in a vessel, and then with clean wet hands, wrap them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will provide unusual sensations and form something like a shell.
The toilet, connected to a complex sewer network, was in almost every home in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
The remains of sewage systems were found in the homes of the Minsk cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed companies.
When you call someone thousands of miles from you, you use a companion.
The satellite in space gets a call and then almost immediately displays it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat curves the light and what we see.
We need a huge rocket with a height of at least 100 feet to deliver a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has incrediblely changed the world. The largest thing that the wheel made for us was the opportunity to carry out much easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars and many other vehicles.
Below is a larger number of medium-sized cats that feed on average prey – from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that hunt for a more small prey like insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche – a special position that each cat occupies and which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called Pride.
The pride includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion tends largely behave like flocks of wolves or dogs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not on other large cats) by behavior, and the same dangerous for their prey.
The tiger, as a fully developed athlete, can climb up (although not very skillful), swim, jump over a long distance, and also beat five times stronger than a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same group (the Panther's family) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
Tiger's rizzling is not like a full-voiced lion rhining, rather confusing exclamations.
Ocelottes like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals on which ocelote hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots pursue and track the animals on which they hunt, by smell, looking for their smell on the ground.
Thanks to night vision, they see very well in the dark, and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey, hiding in the environment, and then suddenly jump to their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they come (for example, if they cross the mountain range or river, or if they pass to another island and thus cannot easily return), they may often find themselves in a different environment than that which they were previously in.
In this new environment, other resources and other rivals, so the new species will need to develop new features or become a stronger opponent than he was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all – they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, when the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can not be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, that is, the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which a person breathes, and absorb carbon dioxide, which a person removes from the body (i.e. exhales).
Plants prepare food from the sun with photosynthesis. They also provide a shadow.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we consume is plants.
Mosaurus was a predator of the highest order of his time, so he was not afraid of anything but other Mosaurus.
His long jaws were dotted with more than 70 sharp teeth like a razor along with their additional set on the palate, which meant that anyone who was on his way could not be saved.
We don't know for sure, but maybe it had a split tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and maybe he was even cannibal.
He also attacked everything that fell into the water; even a giant dinosaur, such as Tirex, would not have been able to compare with him.
Mostly the Romans ate what was familiar to us, but they also had their strange and unusual banquet treats, including wild boar, peacock, slugs and rodents called wolves.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate, sitting on chairs, wealthy men loved to arrange joint banquets, where during the meal they rested, lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include products imported to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods the central temple, which was considered the home of this god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through the ceremonies and holidays.
In each temple was opened the temple yard, and then the inner sanctuary, which could enter only priests.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids were built, which were parts of temples and were called zicurats. 
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent in the open air.
Women were cooking in the yard; shops were ordinary open counters that went outside. The houses were built from stones.
Hanan had no large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was rarely populated. The Old Norse sagas says that Eric Rudius was expelled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But, despite its discovery, at that time Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavi', there were many differences between people, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you watched the film Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Despite the fact that on the back of the document, something is really written, this is not a map of treasures.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "The Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written. The text is at the bottom of the document and turned upside down.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it has a size of 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inch) was stored in a folded state.
Thus, it is likely that the recording was added simply as a tag.
As a result of the landing on Day D and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by French Vichy. These were the French, who concluded a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed south of France, and this landing was called "Dragun Operation".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the "Russia" movement liberated the south of France and moved to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, that is, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civilian", referring to the Latin word "civis", which means "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and this also in a certain way determines the size of society.
City-states can be considered the predecessors of nations. Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge for several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and uniform distribution. 
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving meaningful historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress was its only component, according to the Confederacy's Articles.
Congress lacked authority to set taxes, and due to the lack of national executive or judicial power, it relied on state bodies that often did not cooperate for the sake of implementing all its acts.
He also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
Articles required unanimous permission of all states before their change, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most productive team in the world and world champions in 2006.
Such sports competitions such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating hockey and Formula 1 motorcycle racing are widely known.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions where Italians compete at international games and Olympics.
Japan includes about 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as "archipepags" through the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The beginning of Taiwan lies in the 15th century, when European navigators, sailing past, recorded the name of the island as Ilha Forusa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opens a branch in the southwest of Taiwan, starting the transformation of the practice of aboriginal grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Japan-Price War (1894-1895), the Cynsh government signed the Treaty of Simonosek, under which it transfers sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: Intiguata, Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows room.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they looked at first.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of a fixed photographic image in the world is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the era of analog photographic film. 
Today it is still being produced, but more important is that its aspect ratio has adopted the formats of the image sensors of digital cameras.
The format of 35 mm is actually a little confusing, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore considered 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. EIPiesC families) are equal to or are very close to that proportion.
The frequently used and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamism, while maintaining the degree of order in the image.
According to it, the most effective place to place the main object is the intersection of lines, which divide the raster by three-thirds vertically and horizontally (see. Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has been holding European states together, despite the differences in languages and customs.
His ubiquitous power had an influence on everyone: from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian provisions: wealth must fight suffering and poverty, and the money of the church is for this purpose.
The central organ of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has prompted many to question whether the church really adhered to this postulate.
Shortly after the sudden outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective. Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms, codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries, vital military and civilian supply routes were cut off.
Britain mined fossils in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, creating danger even for neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany was waiting for a similar response to its unrestricted fighting by submarines.
During the 1920's, the predominant moods of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
Realizing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations sought to prevent this in the future.
In 1884, Nicola Tesla moved to the United States of America to apply for a vacancy at Edison in New York.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time intervals were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development is every ruling family that became an outstanding dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty was the unstable age of the divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Sango Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
In these times there were fierce wars between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three States was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China - thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the Grand Palace in Xien.
There are many social and political influences, for example, the use of a metric system, a change in absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the state is the property of the people, and not one individual ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were open to all men, giving the most ambitious and talented opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks on a class basis, they are now based on qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammet was deeply interested in the issues that went beyond this worldly life.  He often visited the cave, which became known as "Hira", on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection. 
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know about its existence. Once in the cave, you will find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. A very small part of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that exists to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many major pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of the dead are several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was erected in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives and members of the Cheops family.
The "sun up" mark looks like the letter "V", and the mark "put down" is similar to a bracket or square without a lower side.
Up, it means that you have to start with the head and push the snuff, and down means that you have to start in the pad (where your hand holds the swab) and pull the puff.
The movement of the bow up usually generates a softer sound, while the movement of the bow down is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to add your own marks with a pencil, but consider that printed marks for bow tools have a certain value, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market expelled from Versailles the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinet, two of their children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Sharle) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, and forced them to return to Paris.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of noisy and threatening king and queen.
The cub forced the king and queen to keep the windows of his carriage wide open.
At some point, a member of the gang waved in front of the stunned Queen the head of the royal guardsman killed in Versailles.
Military expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people himself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks. 
Excess profits from the protracted exploitation of the Filipinos, of course, would be the main achievement of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that served as an impetus to the creation of the order.
The era, when these events took place, is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 years A.D.).
The classical Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is considered to be about 1500 years.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually covers a wide range of ideas, from the promotion of technology or technological imperative to the idea that the fate of a person in a strict sense is dictated by the basic logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as follows the path that mainly lies beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an "influence" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone can say that the car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically inexpedient for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods in the field of health care for the treatment of bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography formed individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose related to this geography, and they, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He is known for being the epicenter of luxury, the beginning of which dates back to about 400 BC. e., and which existed until about 1100 c. e.
In the XII century, his situation deteriorated mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more expensive than in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that the title of the capital of the fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the outfit of the inhabitants of the east was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons for fastening clothes.
Non-commodity agriculture is agriculture, the purpose of which is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the owner/hospital and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic system, which uses the harvested seeds of local plants of this ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize the increase in yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in natural agriculture, and this is still maintained in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected social standards, and allow them to acquire a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be determined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
Qualities that define subculture as a separate phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often express their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of the style, including objects of fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take several stories of poor children who grew up in contempt, misery or intentional cruelty, and were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "jungl children" or wild. They are often kept in captivity by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, parents leave children to fend for themselves due to the rejection of severe mental or physical disabilities of the latter.
It may be that wild children were objects of ill-treatment or seriously injured before they were abandoned or fled.
Some were allegedly grown animals; they said that some lived in the wild on their own.
The uncivilized child, who has grown animals, behaves almost the same (within the limits of physical capabilities) as appropriate carer animals, for example, treats people with fear or indifference.
And although design technologies should make learning easier and more interesting, spaceholding is further.
Scaffolding is not a method of training, but rather a help provided to persons who study new material, for example, a new computer program, or start a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as a scaffolding, like a small person-still in Microsoft Office.
Virtual spaceworks in the software are designed to ask, prompt and explain the procedures that may be difficult for self-study by students.
Children are given to foster families for a number of reasons that may begin with negligence and reach abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up surrounded by devoid of care, attention and upbringing, but they grow. 
We feel that the system of foster families should be a security zone for these children.
Our system of foster care provides safe homes, loving educators, stable education and reliable medical care.
Raising in a foster family should provide everything they need, which they lacked in the house from which they were taken before.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The expressive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of use and pleasure. 
For example, "training" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for the use of the Internet (James, etc., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "continuing relationships" were also defined as new aspects of Aygmy and McCcord's motivation (1998) when they investigated audience's response to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements that last several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sachs in his article "The President's Speech" pointed out that people who are not able to understand the language because of brain damage, however, are able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even assumes that such abilities in the interpretation of human behavior can have animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Conducted in the twentieth century, the study showed that there are two groups of genotypic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from a set of pronounced variations.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with such a digestive system as in humans, it is difficult to ensure the satisfaction of their needs for amino acids due to the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, if not done, it will entail serious consequences: the rise of depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most affordable plant resources would be proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest with primates like us, if not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well digested, but also supplies a significant amount of proteins that contain all the basic amino acids.
Taking into account all these things, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved the "protein issue" in the same way as the chimpanzee is done today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is a process of purposeful awakening during a normal period of sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without a wakeing up completely.
If you find that you are reinstalling the clock in a dream, it can be put in the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variants based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which makes it a wakeful to urible. 
The amount of inner peace that a person has is directly opposite to the level of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone is able to achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent the achievement of this goal is our tension and negativity. 
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was supplemented by Mahayana's love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of all-encompassing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment) wakes up from yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and imaging.
The central place in Tibetan meditation is occupied by the Yoga of the deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to the fact that these countries quarreled.
Two years after the war ended, and former allies became enemies, leading to the outbreak of the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and there were real battles between the armies of countries on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope of retreating and reorganized along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost their relevance in almost one night, when more than 800 000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, which violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient means of transporting a large number of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the naval forces has traditionally ensured that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most worthy of the recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
The goats were probably first domesticated about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient crops and tribes began to breed them to easily get milk, wool, meat and leather.
Home goats were usually kept in herds that moved by hills and other pastures, and they were looked after by coops, often children or adolescents, better known as shepherds. These methods of grazing are used today.
The road was built in England in the 16 century.
And although the horse-drawn roads were essentially two parallel-separated wooden boards, they allowed the horses that worked on them, to develop higher speed and pull the heavier loads than on a slightly more bumpier ordinary roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced to keep tracks on the spot quite early. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks will be more effective if an iron mount is installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear of the wooden wheels of cars.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first all-arms rails appeared.
The first known displacement was walking, people began to walk just two million years ago, with the advent of Gomo Erectus (meaning a person walking straight)
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not go upright as usual. 
The bipeds are found in the fossil remains of Australopithecus aged 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although the sahelantrops may have started walking two legs seven million years ago.
We can start to lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it is only as a treatment for symptoms. However, if we do not seek only a temporary solution, then it is worth finding the root of problems and eliminating them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become larger due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind. 
After Congress received it on July 4, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunleap's printing house, located in several quarters.
During the night, 150-200 copies were made, now known as Danlep Bredsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy went to London on August 10.
Currently, it is known that 25 Danup posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original copy of the manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds still have a lot from the dinosaurs.
Their paws have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like tyrannosaurus.
In fact, all computers that are used today are working through the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In binary numeral system, there can be only one or two values, for example 0 or 1, and, if we say on a computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to immediately diagnose.
The first sign of poisoning can be the presence of an open jar with a medical product or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label to get specific first aid guidelines for this particular poison.
From a formal point of view, enthusiastologists describe this group of insects by the term beetle.
This term is a reflection of centuries-old acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects, which are very well adapted to parasitism in humans.
Both cone-shaped bedbugs and bed bugs are nest insects adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their owner.
In the United States of America, approximately 400 000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, which makes it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged people, as well as younger ones.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women have twice the risks of contracting MS.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interests, or not in the interests of their child.
Such parents can decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopted (in the end, biological parents are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can raise a child.
The main purpose of science is to learn by scientific methods of how the world works. This method really manages most of the scientific research.
Although it is not only experimentation, but an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; the attitude of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, in particular on the Bible in Latin. 
Aristotle's views on all issues of science, including psychology, have been recognized.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their work through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic factors recorded in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the cycle period, which is freely performed even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershi and Chase experiment became one of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershes and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, denoting the DNA of bacterioiophage with radioactive phosphorus, or a protein of bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the proportion of the genetic material and whether the cells are affected by the cells of the embryonic line.
Only mutations in embryonic cells are transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell or cancer death.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit and photograph the orangutans in Borneo, as well as to obtain new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns on cars to get to their places of work, and other people go past them, who work in places they have just left.
In this dynamic traffic there and back, everyone is somehow connected and maintains a transport system based on private cars.
Science now notes that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported the evolution of humanity over the past two million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about them.
You will rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or bridges that are falling in developed countries.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and tolerate failures every day? Maybe transport engineers are just incompetent? Is it something more fundamental?
Road flow is the determination of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, since the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave fairly in concertously; thus, traffic flows mostly have some logical sequence, and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, the relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to rise into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have an advantage to be able to fold the wings along the body.
This opens up to them a wider range of small places where you can hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can not roll their wings - dragonflies and one-days.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed in his rightness, but many people believed in the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars). 
It seems rational because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and size of a river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes its width is 6 miles.
As much as 20% of the water flowing from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon is 6.387 km (3.980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical perfection of their design.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marveling at the construction of their predecessors, which even then was much more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as a country with the lowest population.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also a language of everyday communication for most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in native form, and it is quite simple to extract them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It's earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also hypothesized that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small quantities .
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that the trillions of these particles could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, after its appearance, the pencil became a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, when new methods of writing emerged, the status and use of the pencil were reduced.
People now write messages on the computer screen without having any need to approach the planer.
We can only guess what the keyboard will become when something newer will be invented.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together the core with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling up a heavy cart. The clefting again releases some of that energy. 
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break up with or without a slight push.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The upper layer of the moon is called the bark.
The lunar bark is about 70 km in thickness on the near side and 100 km in thickness on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There can be more moons on the near side because the bark there is thinner. It was easier to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people ticks or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were taken over by them in the process of growing up.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment make or do not force them to do certain things.
Two popular meaningful theories – Maslow's theory of the Needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. On the one hand, they try to stay "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of managers has problems with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, distributing responsibility and bringing people to justice.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable personality who feels that he has to change everything that the team has done and do it in his own way.
In the end, the leader is fully responsible for the success and defeat of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Teams created virtually adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as points of contact with their direct real group.
They often have more autonomy than ordinary team members, as their teams can meet taking into account time zones, which may be incomprehensible to their local executives.
The presence of a real "invisible collective" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a management group to which all members report. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would the organization want to go through the process of introducing an educational organization that takes so much time? One goal of implementing the concepts of organizational training in practice can be innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves.
As a result, the process of joint work of the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovation process to meet the needs of the client.
Before the organization can be innovative, management should create a culture of innovation, as well as exchange of knowledge and organizational training.
The Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Thus, they narrow the search area and make it more accurate.
Scientists in their studies support the relationship between pathology in the brain and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI is shaping a very important computer science division that studies the behavior, learning and intellectual adaptation of the machine.
During AI research, machines force automation tasks that require intellectual behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on solving problems from real life.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it has been embedded in several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important thing in any class. Often the teacher would like to visit with the students places where it is impossible to get by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field activities. Students can look at museum artifacts or admire the beautiful art, sitting with their class.
A virtual tour is also a great way to think about traveling and share experiences with future classes.
For example, Bennett school students in North Carolina every year create a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but its old versions are saved online in the form of an album. 
Blogs can also help improve the student's writing skills. While students often start their experience of blogging with careless grammar and spelling, audience presence usually changes.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers are starting to try to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to better awareness of the world around them." The need to meet the interest of the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to study well outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can determine their positions in the context of articles of others, as well as outline their own points of view on individual issues (Oravets, 2002).
In Ottawa, the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, there are a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the history and modernity of Canada.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the untouched natural beauty of Muscoca and places beyond its borders.
All these and other things emphasize in Ontario what strangers consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite poorly populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildlife.
A comparison of the population that can surprise many: The U.S. has more African Americans than Canada has its own citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and is itself the continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took root greatly in Comoros and Mayotti.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the sea route around the Cape of the Good Hope of Europe in India.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All travel women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of true family status.
It will also be advisable to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what you consider a harassment, and it often happens that you are followed, grabbed by the hand, and the like.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand on your own (cultural differences or not, it is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishing in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and marinides as a strategic poor called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and named Casa Branka, and in 1755 they left him after the earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultanus rebuilt the city called Daru y-Badia, and the Spanish traders who created the shopping bases here gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shopping in all of Morocco.
Not far from old Medina it is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a number of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is quite safe, before any trips abroad, it is necessary to study the situation with the fighting that is still ongoing in the province of Pivna Kiva.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and for one of the cheapest trips in Africa to the sites of observation of mountain gorillas.
To move to Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, as well as because of the relative inaccessibility, the name "Timuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included in the list of jeopardized World Heritage sites due to the threat of the desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops during the reportage of the PBS Miracle of the African world Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities of the country, because it has more Arabic flavor than the African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodijska River.
The park occupies 19500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which holds different representatives of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the National Parks of the Republic of South Africa (SANParks). 
As in all South African national parks, visitors take a daily fee for protection and entrance.
For someone, it can also be profitable to buy a Wild Card, which gives the right to enter some parks in South Africa or all National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a place to pay special attention to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong was compared with a shiny histogram, which is manifested by the presence of water, the harbor of Victoria.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite port side of Cowlon.
The vast majority of urban development is Hong Kong's island is densely located in a wewed area along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonists have appropriated, so if you are looking for evidence of colonial past territory, it is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forests, which stretches for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inner regions of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, because they include some of the last islets of powerful jungle who once covered the Indo-Gangean Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, about a third of which are covered with water or swampy terrain.
Since 1966, Sundarban is a wildlife reserve, and it is assumed that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30 000 spotted deer are now on its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (via the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those that go east and to Jakar/Boutt, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most of the areas are served by small Japanese buses "Koster", which are comfortable and durable. 
A taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150) and Punkha (200).
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a cable-in-law bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapoc River and the city of Oyapoki in Brazil with the city of Saint-George de Lujapoc in French Guinea.
Pylons 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters. It has two lanes for driving a car width of 3.50 m each.
The vertical lumen under the bridge is 15 meters. The design was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017. 
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
Guarani was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the present eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, sometimes engaged in natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as guaycurau and piahua, which survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16 century, as a result of the clashes of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups of indigenous peoples, Paraguay was created, which was formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spaniards began a period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant part of its fundamental features and identity.
Argentina is well known for being one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December in the fields for the polo in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at the other season.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and places of ticket sales for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in a single bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are usually accepted anywhere in the islands, and in many establishments, Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although the currencies of the United Kingdom or the United States can take; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands beyond them, and therefore exchange money before you get away from the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of the equator, there is summer at a time when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature is above +30°C, the usual phenomenon.
Winter can be deceptively cool: the temperature rarely drops below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity in their combination make you feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rain" or "ridden" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to people, wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park management, keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Whatever the humble they look, bison, big deer, elk, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not stay at due diligence. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them a place.
In addition, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so take with you and do not cook the smell and keep clean in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upoul and has a little less than 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became a place of the notorious maritime confrontation in 1889, when seven vessels from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of the supreme leader of the supermasus Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the location of the Auckland between two harbors. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor) are located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bey in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by trees hurried.
Tamaki Driv beaches are in the bay of Wuitama, in the elite suburbs of Mishna Bay and Saint-Heliène in Central Auckland.
These are family, sometimes crowded beaches with lots of shops along the coast. Swimming safely.
The main local beer, "Number One" is simple, but enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines can better withstand transportation.
Local tap water is perfectly safe for drinking, however, if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of coffee "flet-wheat" is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is prepared with a slide of cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk. 
This hot chocolate meets the requirements of Belgian standards. And fruit juices are not cheap at all, but they are beautiful.
Many trips to the reef occur all year round, and the injuries caused by any of these reasons at the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay special attention to the warnings of danger.
Kuboomeduzes are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be seen in other months.
Sharks really exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main natural environment is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler a calm confidence that he will have a place to spend the night as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often collaborate with specific hotels, although you can try to book some other accommodation with them, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfer organization, or even combined packages of air travel and hotels.
They can also keep booking for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must first pass through a travel agency, and not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of visitors to music events decide to spend the night on the spot, and for most visitors this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be near the action, you will have to come early to take a place closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special places for camping families with young children. 
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, because the journey through the ice causes a rather terrible sound if you are very close to its source.
Cruises in St. Petersburg involve spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos tend to make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and watches are usually missing, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and indoors.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication negatively affects the ability to assess the situation, so all good gambling players know how important it is to stay sober. 
Anyone who plans to drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On ice and snow-covered roads, friction is small, and it is not allowed to drive like on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall out in a very short period of time to get stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited to snow falling or blowing, or by the formation of water or ice on the windows of the machines.
On the other hand, icy and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without obstacles all year round.
Safari is probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa, which attracts the attention of many visitors.
The term safaris in general use means a journey with land for admiring the incredible African wildlife, especially in a savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach car close, so standard equipment will allow them to be well considered.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are fearful, and it is better to observe them in binoculars.
A walk of the safari (also called "walking in the bushes", "derivative safari" or a journey "walking") - a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the tournaments will be held in different places throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked tickets and accommodation for 2020 before you announced a delay, you may have a difficult situation.

If you are unfamiliar with rural roads, take into account: they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths and sharp bends.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is extremely important to follow them.
Interestingly, however, mobile communication here is much better than on many other sections of the route, for example, at the "Pennsiva Wilds".
