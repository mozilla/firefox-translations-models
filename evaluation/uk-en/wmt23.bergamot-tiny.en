And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
‚Äî Acquisition letter.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we keep our best.
Feeling they fear.
Very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make it repeated several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and in the head it turns - how you, s@ki, are afraid, if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat about this greatness.
As you are not sure of yourself.
It's like, sexual intercourse with an impotent who needs to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that he succeeds, for a very long time and stubbornly try for him and at the same time think, when this painful bullying will finally end.
We repeat this in order to save us all.
Because it is very difficult to fight an unarmed person against a brainless body with an automatic machine.
Because then, when this uncleanness is driven out of our land, we will have to arrange the city.
Whoever we speak, everyone has some words.
Words that the smell of rot in the city.
We will probably need a lot of detergents to just wash the sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time.Because all that these inhumans touched have the smell of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were great.
Three healthy men undressed her and left on the street, forbade someone to approach her to help.
She stood on the street for three hours and only spoke loudly:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to me, my dear.
Don't endanger yourself.
Please!
We still have a lot of things to do with you...
Then!
And yet.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's even hard for me to think they're not stealing.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because they constantly stick out postcards in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces.
And when they are near, the chersons shall spread with their uncleanness with their heads with their hands with their teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we'll wait.
Wait.
We clutch your teeth, squee the fists to numbness in our fingers and wait.
Because we have something to expect.
To be once and for all.
And none of this evildoers remained.
And then we will wash the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."

I need communication. I am completely deoxidized. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but still do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same specialty as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar issues are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic due to the war.
The conclusions will help to get to know their situation better and plan the most effective help.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who, upon request for humanitarian aid, received a full-time e-mail, receives an invitation to a study (from the invitation@cx4survey.cz address).
The questionnaire is filled every one only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
TECHNIQUE IN PRODUCTION
MECHANICS IN PRODUCTION
We produce electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines ‚Äì nothing would have happened without these devices with Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities for both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I want to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the gathering is prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I will be grateful for the right advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we will overcome all the troubles.
Together we will win.
So please contact.
I'll listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees arriving without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required to pay first aid in 5000 kronor).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation ‚Äì to be considered unemployed, not to have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first payment of the aid will cease to be unconditional.
If the refugee is provided with free housing, daily reusable food and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to apply for a payment of 5000 kronor.
The authorities will begin to believe that the basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means the appointment of humanitarian aid is fulfilled and there is no need for money.
This event is designed to solve the problem with gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic just for the sake of financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ the right to cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth aid, as before, will be only those refugees who will prove the immediate need (lack of work, etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who have not been provided with free housing, daily reusable food and hygiene products will be able to receive assistance in monetary form;
üìå The applicant must actually live in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "tourism for help" when a refugee lives in the same country, and comes to the Czech Republic for several days exclusively for money.
According to the law, each foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after the relocation.
If the address in the application form does not coincide with the address specified in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of the aid will be refused.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion on the payment of humanitarian aid. crown.
And today I was engaged all day in the trenching of defensive structures, but the whole city is trenching, something not very joyful forecast for the near future.
Honestly tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army to dig trenches and trenches, for this you need to deal with the organization of equipment and people, and I am the head of the village is my responsibilities
All utilities are involved, and we also turn to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We need to unite, otherwise we will not defeat the katsaps
Very big propaganda for people to despair and weaken resistance
Honestly, I still did not take a shovel in my hands today, I hope that I will not have to
I have pasted on the phone cover girls stickers so that I did not forget that I am feminine
What happens if the bill is passed?
A Government Commission will be formed from representatives of the President's Office, some ministries and business associations that will accelerate the tools of state regulation of economic activity.
The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permitting business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will offer which permits or procedures need to be removed.
The Cabinet of Ministers will in an accelerated mode remove all ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, in the skull mode!
It will not matter whether the Cabinet of Ministers will be contrary to the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of doing business, which may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
Business regulation by the state will take place on the principle of ‚Äúone new resolution ‚Äì minus two old ones‚Äù.
Whether it has any meaning.
How does this relate to the environment?
In the behind-the-scenes regime, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on permits or procedures in the field of the environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be under threat!
Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We will not even know how and who changes the bylaws, until the final decisions are made.
The only ones who have access to information and the possibility of influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Brief deadlines for reviewing permits, non-transparent procedure, lack of any decision-making criteria are moving somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we urge environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal
They told her ‚Äì babo, the Russians came to the village; Grab your cat and climb into the bus.
But I refused ‚Äì that I, mare old... Save children and girls, I will already break here... The grandmother goes down to the cellar, she sews cucumbers, rolls out a tub of a trough, a pile of troughs; there the door ‚Äì iron stocks and silver castles.
And behind the door, someone thunders in chains.
I didn't think - says the grandmother - that I will live.
Seventy years ‚Äì and again a curl.
Go ‚Äì only not in the gardens, because I curse, you will bring us closer "Putin kaput".
The baubin cat is studded, the glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks roar and shin between the houses.
The Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Hello, go to the post office and confirm your identity through "check-in" then, when confirming, you will be given a code, and this code must again be specified in registration on the Internet and you should be ready.
There must be a bank card registered for the person who wants to receive financial assistance another is not suitable.
I did so familiar, so I indicated that I needed some key, but when she survived, I waited for the government there she was told why she came because she had already been registered.
She also showed, in this application, that you need some key, but in fact it is already the registration of the already
help me, the application was issued online on May 5, but something is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the government of work or wait
it is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but writes that the person is not confirmed, through the bank, the system gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelino!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" the word "Ukraine".
The use of this period in recent decades has evolved into a serious political issue.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We especially thank you for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which made it possible to understand what was sometimes not learned at the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will become even more fruitful!
We wish all creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions he popularizes the world classics in the Ukrainian language, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfume" (P. S√ºskind), "Sin" by M. Kotsyubynsky, "Letter of Unfamiliar" and "Wild" S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works that he culminates are difficult to perceive, require the attachment of the soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep experiences and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, it is the way to the recovery of modern man.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005 he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine. Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mikhail's talent hope that at the end of the war they will again hear his game on the saxophone, see his unsurpassed ability to reincarnate, will be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to the high arts
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals that are mined in our country include: coal and lignite, oil, natural gas, peat, combustible shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own coal and brown coal needs.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, an acute shortage can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissya.
Since the mid-1990s it was used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farming, glass, porcelain-faience, food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
There are considerable deposits of combustible shale in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is associated with the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as to the regional foothill deflections.
Coal.
94.3% of coal deposits of our state are coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to the high content of carbon in it, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine there are deposits of the best grade of coal - anthracite, the carbon content in which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of the coal is coking.
After special treatment, it is used during the smelting of cast iron and steel.
According to the explored coal reserves, Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and first place in Europe, and in terms of production - respectively XI place and III place.
explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Forecast stocks are about 120 billion tons.
The Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dumped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äì and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #on Azovstal."
On April 8, 2022, the russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk, was written "For children".
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, among them 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to the enemies.
Then it helped the soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions that are left on shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine only because they do not like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia needs to be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly into any other country!
The transition Vy≈°n√© Nemekc√© met us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We take insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it can not heat up.
Is it possible to pass control in an accelerated mode?"
The border guard allowed us to start the queue, even the trucks we warmly gave way.
Lviv
The city of Lion lives.
It is like an aorta of the Ukrainian body ‚Äì an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictated windows of the cathedrals.
It envelops monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war is not heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices sound at the same time, not to hear it in coffee shops and in the bars where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier ‚Äì at 11 p.m., life is hidden from the curfew.
But it is: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 p.m. and an alarmed, it was only heard from a warning to someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities ‚Äì through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities in which the air smells of hope.
People, despite the pain, return and rebuild life.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Kotings of shells or automatic bursts?..)
On the smashed balcony ‚Äì a Ukrainian flag stretched.
At the front door there are holes, such that the living room gradually becomes the street.
And three break near these front doors.
Clean up, repair, build a wall and new life with it.
And the car two quarters below is walking mother and a child.
I can't help but ask myself, "Did their dad survive the executions of men in Bucha?
Does it still stroll with them?‚Äù
On the way out of Irpin ‚Äì the cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars on which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become the object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand surrounded by auto skeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slowed air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks from the death of passengers...
If you look through the holes in the hulls of cars, you can see hundreds of the same shots.
And in one of the cars ‚Äì an abandoned bicycle, in the other ‚Äì a warm children's overalls.
Somewhere an unburned book with instructions for using the airbag.
The remains of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We go further, look back at the city for the last time ‚Äì and come across the same bridge, under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the most overturned bus, but it is on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This child in the white overalls probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wored clothes is abandoned in one of the cars?
On the broken bridge sits a man, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sits and looks at the abyss between Kiev and Bucha.
Does not take pictures, but only watches.
Perhaps he also imagines that he stands under the bridge, and he thinks: how is it?
"Happy Holiday!" ‚Äì a man shouts to us joyfully. "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Nikolaev
The hero city, the outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
The frontline city, which the occupiers cannot take in any way.
And we believe that they will not be captured ‚Äì the city is fighting and living.
On the corner of the streets, at every second intersection ‚Äì neatly folded tires and Bandera smoothies.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet ‚Äì the noise against which the city lived, subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for security.
People live "with candles", or rather, with flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we turn on the light only in the kitchen ‚Äì quickly and if necessary.
The grandmother hung the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light does not break through.
Near my sister's children's bed there is a hunting rifle.
"On hand from the 24th," says the father.
With air alarms and explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in constant anxiety mode.
When then to live?
The Russian army ‚Äì 30 kilometers from the city, shots from ‚Äúpions‚Äù fly to the Zhovtnevy district, cover Kulbakine.
Several times it comes close to my relatives.
On the next quarter, across the road from us.
To the neighbors of the grandmother ‚Äì the grandmother took windows, the children took them to their home, to the safer district.
And we are on the verge of Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
On the main Soborna street, a siren is howling, and an elderly couple sits on the bench, they will talk about something, calmly discuss it.
A cyclist passes by them.
Looking at Dad ‚Äì What Do We Do?
"Well, let's drink... Let's drink coffee?"
So we sit on Soborna Street (formerly Soviet, by the way) in a square near the monument to St. Nicholas.
What else to do?
To be honest, when the siren catches you by surprise on the street, often and there is no place to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident ‚Äì once from the decorated RSA.
Now in the place where the trident flaunted, there is an empty "nothing".
Just like on the site of the office of the head of the regional state administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed clearly on the table of Kim.
The war is gaining completely different outlines when it is not in the news, but under its feet.
I go through the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step to hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor ‚Äì someone has submitted requests and statements, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices ‚Äì dusty cosmetic bag.
On the bedside table there is a flower.
They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lives.
Met a bodyguard who was at the post on March 29.
Survived.
"They shuffled, sewn," he points to his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already at work.‚Äù
Only journalists can get to the RSA.
Together with us is a pair of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photo, direct inclusions, interviews.
According to official data, 36 dead.
This is "September 11 in Mykolayiv," a "monument to the Russian world," comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is only one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see a terrible void in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, Russia has reduced more than a third of gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, in May ‚Äì to Finland.
In June, the russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to block the supply of natural gas this way in July.
Russia used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation turned off gas supplies to Ukrainians within two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the primary desire is to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing the Russian economy is to donate to the third world war.
The coming winter will be difficult, but will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to diversify gas and oil supplies quickly.
But in order to become energy-independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime intimidates Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and the lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will win when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort should be experienced so that the next generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia burns the harvest in the Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy ripening crops of grain and oilseeds.
Russia is causing the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world who are suffering from food shortages could rise by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian harvests, the russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block sea exports.
Destruction of the agrarian potential of Ukraine is another manifestation of the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it could not continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation launches an innovative hotline format ‚Äî the virtual center of Diia.Business.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registration of their own stay, business registration, employment and assistance.
Therefore, the virtual center Diia.Business is launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how to be afraid of every important day, and as you never know a day or a minute that can come
Hello, Anna, can I ask you to call back to the pediatrician and ask when the next time you can come for vaccination for Darusya.
Should be tomorrow, I can't come because you need to replace the battery in the car, it will be until the end of the week.
The neighbor brought the cable and we charged Marina's car.
But in the car panel writes, you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia should bring it from Ukraine, and here it will be replaced by me
Tomorrow I will try to start a car, if it works, we will go by ourselves, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I do not start, then I will write to you and you will come after us
I am not very comfortable to disturb you, distract you from work.
Well, let's go with you at 11:45, so as not to take risks.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories about escaping to a safe place, stories of mothers who tell their children about the great adventure journey into which they go together to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and fear of all adults who still do not quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
The stories of children, for whom the only memory of the house is a toy for which they could cling during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, sad people are not clear, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip is a return to a safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Home returns are expected.
The theme of the war is ubiquitous, so our gait may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of the growth of antipathies and hostile moods in society, which are inflated and exploited by populists, we want to note that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic form and thus apply for participation in this holiday of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it.‚Äù
Despite such a painful topic, the parade was still made light and encouraging.
To this hand, masters and craftswomen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, motankas, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade was held from Campa to Vaclavak, and at each stop he played a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time to show what they are faced, Ukrainians are now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects the normal life that interrupts the air attack.
On the salvation first comes the birds that glow - they cover their wings in the first place, children.
And after a recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of the wings that protects becomes even more active.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads in a column.
And all the creatures were returning to life: sunflowers, and motankas, and toys and even docks.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who helped and help Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and security will reign in the houses."
His wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, a man meets friends and for three days gets into a binge, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He thinks to tell his wife why he was not so long.
Calls at the door, pours snails on the floor, his wife opens, he, adjusting them with his hands, says:
"Well, we've come!"
We go, let's go, let's go...
Our editorial office talked with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in her native Nikopol in the field of architecture of buildings and structures.
"Now I try to realize myself as an artist," the Ukrainian woman said.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, experiences for relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is a confusion regarding the adaptation to the new conditions in which she found herself with the children.
But the woman believes in her strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without leaving her mind to return to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is from Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk region.
That's where she met her husband and gave birth to two children - her son and daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol institution.
"By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in "artist-designer"," Maryna said.
And everything was fine, but on February 24 her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Maryna, without hesitation, left Ukraine with her children.
The shelter for the woman was Prague.
"Of course, a new city, a large, crowded... New language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I am not ashamed to seek help from the Czechs and never felt any aggression from them.
Thank you for it," Marina shared.
According to her, in solving issues related to the search for housing, visa and insurance, submission of documents for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
Having received a visa of a torbotage stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they are spreading their hands..." she said.
"We were not taken to the kindergarten, because there are no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one knows exactly.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She wanted to help me with the search for a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different instances, but..." Maryna continues.
"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and naughty.
I can't say that children interfere with me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech courses.
Once I went with the little ones to classes from the Czech, so they played a little, and then began to behave restlessly.
I, as a normal mom, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with little ones someone was during my studies...But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with the children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which a special thanks to the Czech Republic," Maryna added.
When children sleep, Marina is engaged in self-education, teaches Czech online, because she understands that it will help her find a job and somehow self-organize in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Marina looked through vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: "As part of the initiative of the Association "Sporek Zaedno", with the support of the EC representative office in the Czech Republic "12 stars for Ukraine", we organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only creative imagination is required from the participants...‚Äù
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
‚ÄúI got the courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
I didn't sleep before that, I was worried.
In addition, I did not take the brush in my hands for six years," the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format paintings with acrylic on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works - as a basis of the palette, we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue and yellow colors," added Marina.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic will be held in Prague with their participation.
‚ÄúThis is how it happens in life.
All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Maryna said.
"And now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is the fight against your fears and yourself.
But you have to do something," the woman said.
Marina owes the Czech Republic for hospitality and cordiality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to travel to safer territories.
On September 1, the academic year began in Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will take a long time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia began.
However, Ukrainians do not expect better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages from Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took a blow back in the first days of the full-scale war, when the russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital in a few days and capture it.
These cities and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, sometimes the occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, shot immediately after active hostilities and a few weeks later to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia launched a new stage of this war ‚Äì information.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce Ukraine's support from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, and so become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, the well-known human rights organization noted in its report: the Ukrainian military is equipping positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from which the civilian population is fully evacuated.
Do not succumb to the information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia has attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures the civilian population, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war, it has no right to any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and knock the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine to stand against Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.

In addition, in my perfect house would be an attic where we can make a home theater or an entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a swimming pool with several hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just engage in various team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, and more.

In FC "Minaj" claim that this is a fresh photo of the latest trainings after a fight with the Russians
In the Turkish Antalya at the meeting there was a conflict between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minaj" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik".
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of the local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, the Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
Then the fight was confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC "Minaj", the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
It seems that one of them was drunk and clung to the hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight really happened, but already on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal warehouses.
The number of victims from the side of Shynnyk only confirms the fact that the Russians also as "throw," the statement said.
The club says that after the end of the clash, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, the local police had to intervene.
"Before the meeting, the main requirement of FC "Minaj" to the organizers was the lack of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle "Shinnik", - said in a statement.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that the fight was, but assures that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Telegram channel Baza writes that representatives of "Minai" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The best advantage was on their side.
A few people attacked our boyfriend.
Yaroslavtsy stood up for him and defended.
Ours were five or six people, there are many more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told the report "Kommersant".
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"Yaroslav football players were examined by a doctor, among the damage - dissecting the lip, a fracture of the finger on the leg and suspicion of the slaughter of the ribs," Kommersant writes.
"I do not understand where the Ukrainians could get to the hotel, because when we booked a hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," Shinnyk CEO Serhiy Kulakov said in a comment to journalists.
Subsequently, Kulakov told the Russian agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not evicted, they decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what is the medicine for diabetics
7 minutes (s) ago
Injections that are gaining popularity help to lose up to 15% of the weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell injections for weight loss Wegovy, which are used by some famous people, in particular, Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is the semiglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
In its application admitted Elon Musk and Kim Kardashyan, who have a large audience in social networks.
The drug is also popular among well-known Hollywood bloggers and stars.
Semaglutids and other treatments for type 2 diabetes can really contribute to weight loss.
Influencing specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to feel hungry, saturated faster and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick solution and not a miracle medicine that helps to lose weight without any effort.
Treatment is carried out under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical exertion.
Like any medication, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating and gases.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of fat on the face, and in some people - to the subsidence of the cheeks and the appearance of a new wrinkle.
This effect was called "face Ozeropy", from the name of another drug to treat diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise to take Wegovy for no more than two years.

In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to restore previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny during a conversation with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Maryinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Armed Forces of Ukraine reliably hold the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhnyi said.
In a conversation with General Milli Zaluzhny shared his concern over Russia's use of sea surface drones, which poses a threat to civil shipping in the Black Sea.
Russian troops, after the capture of Soledar, continue to squeeze the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main goal of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian defense ministry, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut for his troops was "developing successfully."
On February 11, the evening report of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night of 11, the Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, only from six o'clock in the evening of Friday and until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen "shaheghs" that the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Azov Sea.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile attack on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to strengthen sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine will impose new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (Olaf Scholz), speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of the EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "for as long as necessary."
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the most financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public auctions under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, aircraft - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German Chancellor once again stressed that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties in the military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to coordinate the supply of weapons to Kyiv with partners.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022, of support for European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the EU countries intend to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he stressed.

President of the European Parliament Roberta Mezzola during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke, called for providing Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons.
"EU Member States should quickly consider as the next step, providing long-range systems and fighter jets needed for you to protect the freedom that many take for granted," Mezzola said.
According to her, the answer should be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelensky.

Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
Ukraine, which wins, is a member of the European Union, which is winning," Zelensky said in his speech to MEPs.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against the "most anti-European power of the modern world."
"The Ukrainian European way of life is being destroyed by total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European pathway after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of all 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 EU countries.
We will not allow this," the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the supply of weapons

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, according to analysts' report for February 8.
It also notes that geolocation footage of hostilities confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of the Two-Year-Northwest of Svatove.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have not yet given Russian troops to achieve significant success.
ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet taken full pace, the Russian command has not yet put into operation parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after its deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region are now initiating (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the conditions for the battle ending with the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final climax on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts, this climax can probably create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces, which they can use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on leading offensive operations in five directions: Kupyansk, Lymansky, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Mar"

SpaceX limited the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones through Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he responded to information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to manage drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies must decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then they do not invent how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its "right" to murder, seizure of territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink should not be a weapon
On the eve of the main operating officer of SpaceX Gwynn Schotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using in countering Russian aggression, "has never been intended for use in the form of weapons."
"However, Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any transaction.
We know that the military is using it to communicate, and that's OK.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," the director of Reuters quoted him as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to drive drones, Shotull noted that SpaceX could "restrict their ability to do so."
"There is something we can do and have already done," she added.
What measures the company took, it refuted to clarify.
SpaceX "barged" with U.S. defense ministry for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX handed over Starlink systems to Kyiv for free to provide the population with the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX reported the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue to finance Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take the issue on himself.
Then she estimated the necessary funding by the end of 2022 at $ 120 million, and over the next 12 months - at about $ 400 million.
The issue of financing was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US defense ministry to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

With Germany, relations develop undulatingly - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv against the background of Russian aggression are developing "excitedly" - they have "lifts and downturns".
This position he voiced in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, released on Thursday, February 9.
‚ÄúBy nature, I am a quick man.
Others act more slowly, which can also be associated with their bureaucracy," Zelensky said, adding that in the conditions of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every second.
Revitalization with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at some stage, Germany's "conservative attitude" had changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier) - Ed.), with whom I previously had difficulties, especially because of the so-called "Steinmeier formula,"" Zelensky said.
He stressed that a "good job" was carried out, which allowed to change the relationship.
‚ÄúWe received IRIS-T Air Defense Systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky's estimates, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate around the supply of Leopard combat tanks to Kiev returned relations with Germany "in a difficult phase," the President of Ukraine said.
He called the discussions on this "emotional and complex."
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this assistance is needed not by us, but by the Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorical attitude to fighters
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kyiv with combat tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighters, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will in no case pass warplanes.
At the same time, the Chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as necessary."
He made the corresponding statements after a meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of the leaders of the European Union on Thursday.

According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform duties until the oath of the new government.
In the replacement of Gabrilycsa Sandu has already offered its security adviser, current Secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Interior Minister Dorin Rechan.
His candidacy should be approved by the parliament in which the majority has the party "Action and Solidarity".

Rechan has already said that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.

The country has twice experienced a complete power outage across the country as a result of Russia's strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to stop them completely.
Chisinau called the decline in supply volumes to political decisions not related to payment issues.

According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization "White Helmets", who carry out a rescue mission in the regiment-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the White Helmets said that only two small international teams of volunteers who do not have rescue equipment arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN is received in the region.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Human Rights Monitoring Centre, which operates in London and reports on events from rebel-held areas of Syria, noted that one UN aid party has arrived in the region the day before, but it lacks tents for shelter and equipment to dismantle the rubble.
About three thousand White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.

The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
Early in the morning of February 6, in southeastern Turkey, as well as in northern Syria, there was a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8.

Turkey survived the last tremors of such force in 1939, when about 33 thousand people were killed.
For less than 12 hours, Turkey's southeast has been rocked by a second powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus hosts a decisive round of presidential elections - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12, is the second, decisive round of presidential elections.
It was made by ex-Foreign Minister Nicos Christodudilidis and former Prison Permanent Representative to the United Nations Andreas Mavroyanis.
Conservative politician Christodulidis received 32 percent of the vote, his rival in the second round of Mavroyanis, who is supported by left-wing forces, gained 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Union (DISY) party Avera Pophyte.
The DISY party after the defeat of her candidate in the first round failed to decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP news agency notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been in the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal vote.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current elections will hold the post of head of state within five years and will become the eighth President of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island occupied by the Turks proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which Ankara recognized only.
Recent negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots take part in the elections - about 560 thousand people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote on them.

Energoatom announced a new threat to the ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of NNEGC Energoatom Petro Kotin called the decline of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats to the ZNPP.
Reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir - this is a new one added to the threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station received fertilizing for its generators, for turbine capacitors and for safety systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and slightly increased, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Cotina was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovka HPP, began to lose less water, while the influx at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The President of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling ponds at the ZNPP are sufficiently filled and so far there is enough water, but in the event of a decrease in the level of the reservoir to a critical point, this, according to him, "there will be a big problem for the ZNPP."
Kotin stressed that the level of 12 meters would be critical, an emergency level of 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would not allow a critical situation.

Greek Foreign Minister visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-term opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of two states, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu held an unexpected meeting, at which, as the cameras of Greek television were recorded, even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for becoming one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after a natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to start the dialogue again and solve their problems.
"The help of Greece to the Turkish people does not end there," the Greek Foreign Minister stressed.
According to him, Athens "will do everything" - at the bilateral level, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antachi and Hatai regions.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as "miracglas's diphomas," helped to achieve some discharge.
Conflict through the Islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for the forties of sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara casts doubt on the sovereignty of Greece over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to violate international treaties while maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the location of troops on the islands with the threat of numerous landing vessels on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
READ MORE: Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims with the flight of fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened an invasion of the Greek islands.
Ankara's warming with Armenia
Against the backdrop of the tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened the crossing closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia reported the dispatch of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake, which occurred on February 6 and claimed the lives of more than 33 thousand people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense for historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.
As the successor of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey recognizes that it has exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define this as genocide.
Meanwhile, the genocide of the Armenian condemned, in particular, the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation was only complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun in Brussels, within the framework of which a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format is also held in the so-called Ramstein format.
The agenda of the event is further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said to meet that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons necessary for it "to win this war."
"We do not see any indication that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks," he was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft.
The head of the Munich conference opposes the ‚Äúred lines‚Äù in helping Ukraine
During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long-term guidelines for the Alliance‚Äôs defence planning.
"Allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Stoltenberg was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.
What to expect from the ninth "Ramstein"
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group will meet at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, in which Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov takes part in.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join the special session of the NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 countries participating in the Contact Group are united with you in this struggle for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of a meeting with a Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership had previously expressed hope that at the regular meeting of Ramstein, partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine or work in institutions and organizations financed from the state budget of the Russian Federation to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was announced in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Hryhorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it waged in Ukraine.
‚ÄúCulture is a strategic weapon of Russia.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Museum, the Hermitage, very clearly says that the exhibition projects of the museum abroad are their special operation," Grigorenko says.
In her opinion, now dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, often Ukrainian artists refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Recently, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough for those representatives of the culture of the Russian Federation who support Putin's policy, still manage to tour in Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, it is necessary to have names in the European sanctions lists," Grigorenko says and adds: "We are working to ensure that the figures of culture of the Russian Federation, who promote Russian narratives outside Russia, become part of the next sanctions package.
This will enable the EU to officially ban their economic activities, in particular, concerts."
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he at the summit in Kiev asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of figures of culture and media sphere of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

U.S. ready to sell to Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment worth $ 10 billion
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of Poland's military equipment and services worth about $ 10 billion.
This was announced by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Celdin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
First of all, we are talking about the launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility missile system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the United States' foreign and national security objectives by increasing the security of a NATO member who is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In general, Poland has requested the purchase of such equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS bootable device module;
- 45 army tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of guided multiple rocket launcher GMLRS (M30A2, M312, XM403);
The agreement also includes rockets, communication equipment, spare parts and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and staff equipment, support for system integration, engineering and logistics services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of logistics and software.
According to Bloomberg, new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland in the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also requested missile launchers from South Korea, the newspaper informs.
NATO Secretary General urges U.S. to be ready for Russia's long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to protect in the war against the Russian Federation is not removed from the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is the presence of soldiers or aviators who are able to use them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today," Sunak said about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing is removed from the agenda, and our leadership in this matter is what we all have to be proud of together."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine as ‚Äúnext month‚Äù and said that Ukraine "should never be vulnerable to attack," and also called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but to strengthen Ukraine in the long run."
According to him, the UK agreed to expand its training program, according to which 10 thousand troops have been trained over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, "to accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During the press conference, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of the UK.
Thank you to all the people of the United Kingdom, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call to grant Western fighters to Ukraine and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kiev.
The Russian embassy in London has already stated that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military and political consequences" for the whole world.
Foreign Secretary Dmitry Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk to Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with the Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia's full-scale invasion is approaching the annual mark.
I thanked for the last decision on the tanks.
I also raised the question of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation."
Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the expected new offensive of Russia in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine from early January.

"Politics and profits" are in the way of vaccination
The Director General of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not use effectively existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be possible to do away.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective health care products and effective medical instruments.
But the world badly used these tools," Tedros said, addressing the participants from 100 countries.
Obstacles to achieving the WHO goal of vaccination 40% of the population of each country from the coronavirus is "policy and profits," said the head of the WHO, "not production."
"Countries that have already achieved the goal of 40%, including all G-20 countries, should give their place in the queue for the delivery of vaccines in favor of COVAX and the African vaccine acquisition fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international cooperation initiative created to fairly divide the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people, without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!" - noted Ghebreyesus on the social network Twitter.
The WHO official representative also called on vaccine manufacturers to "make priority and implement their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African vaccine acquisition fund]" and become "much more transparent about where it is directed."
AVAT is an African Union initiative to provide access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "exchange know-how, technology and licenses and abandon intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Carren Attita, a contributor to The Washington Post called on the US administration to share with the world the "recipient" of the Moderna vaccine.
‚ÄúThe U.S. administration has ripped up on the vaccines it has donated in the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it is not a good-hearted philanthropy; it is arrogance.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they initially asked for a fair opportunity," the viewer said.
"We are not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we call for a reasonable investment in global recovery."
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration urged to abandon patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
This refusal has, according to the plan of the US administration, to allow poorer countries to produce drugs-analogues of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, etc.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced an increase in prices for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Resource Center for Coronavirus at Johns Hopkins University reported on Monday that it recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been introduced.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft for Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that "not easy to accept."
This was stated by one of the closest allies of Ukraine in an interview with CNN amid discussions of new arms supplies of Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura K√ºnsberg, in Warsaw in an exclusive interview that will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 aircraft would create a "serious problem" for Poland, because the Polish air force has fewer than 50 aircraft, and the Poles themselves "there are not enough... We'll need a lot more."
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it's not enough just to send a few aircraft."
These comments of President Duda came amid discussions of new arms supplies of Ukraine, including Western tanks and anti-missile installations for a longer time.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has persistently persuaded its NATO allies to send Patriot installations and Western-made tanks to Kyiv, such as the German Leopard tanks.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy carried out an undeclared European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aviation "wings of freedom" to Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to the members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hopes that the next negotiations on the provision of aviation to Ukraine would also be successful.
‚ÄúI have heard from some European leaders about the willingness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a number of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelensky said.
As Voice of America reported, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to hand over its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra said that his government would consider Kyiv's request for F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could reach Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that the previously handed the weapons that the United States refused to supply, eventually fell into Ukraine, if it was agreed to be handed over by European NATO allies.

CHISINIV, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the President of Moldova announced Moscow's conspires to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, transfer the country "to the disposal of Russia" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Mai Sandu's briefing took place a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted Russian intelligence plans to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by representatives of Moldovan intelligence.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, which will resort to force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power of Chisinau to the illegitimate one," Sandu said, "that would transfer our country to the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials have not responded to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million people, has been trying to establish closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organising criminal elements and stopped attempting to commit violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
Among them, a serious energy crisis after Moscow has sharply reduced gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents in recent months, related to missiles that have crossed airspace and the debris that have been found on its territory.
The Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information received by the special services contained what it called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said the Moldovan parliament should adopt bills to ensure the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office "necessary tools for more effective fight against risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely rely on several internal forces, but especially criminal groups," and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shore and Volodymyr Plakhotnyuk, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, US and UK sanctions were imposed on both men.
Last autumn, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shore party, also shook Moldova in an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing took place on Monday after Moldova's prime minister, Natalia Gavrilita, resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, a successor to Gabriel.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department's deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has been supporting campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of weapons in the form of weapons to achieve its goals."

And in the aggressor country, her motives were twisted, because of which she now feels like a "traitor".
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
The military is urged not to despise the old woman.
"Now that Anna Ivanovna from the Russians received a mine in the yard, and from Ukrainians help, her grandson is escaping in Poland, when she learned about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away," says the compass with the pseudonym "Cadet"

Literally: "To increase the pace of the offensive, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
To the border areas with Ukraine by rail are transferred to the railway lines removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and the northern fleet.
Details: In the Volyn and Polissya directions, the enemy did not conduct active actions.
There have been no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
The identified units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
The enemy is threatening to launch missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure throughout the territory of Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy's provocations on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We refuse Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models ‚Äì Zaluzhny
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny held a telephone conversation with the head of the joint committee of US chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.

Direct speech of Zaluzhny: "We also discussed with my American colleague a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we finish.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our state, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, maintain the occupied frontiers and positions."
"The one who came up with this hellish summer was clearly inconscious!" "I complained to Dikorosla and stretched out her hands, as if she wanted to reach the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," said Varta indifferently, stirring the ice in a cocktail. "In autumn, because it's raining and drizzling, grasses rot.
In winter, because it is cold and the potion freezes.
In the spring, because it is raining again...
‚Äî I would sit in the Carpathians, ‚Äî The guard indifferently pulled her shoulders.
Although the city did not like it.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quiet and green, as a hundred years ago or before.
But there is no magic that would allow you to return to the past.
"Phah!
Say that! ‚Äî Wild peeked her palm on the table ‚Äî and the vases with flowers timidly turned. ‚Äî You would have sat for a week in the meadow of my grandmother Rutmera with her colleagues, I would pray for every road truck, so that you would only be taken from there to any city.
Unless you loved from morning to night of wandering beds, sorting out herbs, hanging them under the ceiling and at the same time singing old men.
For the grandmother was rested by the horn, that without words, no my potion will be as it should.
And wait, it's not yet I remembered about picking up all over the night!...
But where there, our white-handed, you would die, a week would not have passed!
Through such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like such a "work" that it is their conscious choice, and the like.
But if you start really to understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Now the problem with the involvement of Ukrainian women in the prostitution is especially acute.
The problem is.
Our current president even had the idea to legitimize prostitution... Because of that, I didn't treat him very well.
I think you need to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model".
This is not a woman, but a client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business", and make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is nothing more hope.
Men should also think about what they buy - "pleasure " or violence...
There is a need for another... you can see me where the nearest optics with the doctor is to prescribe a prescription for glasses.
And the frame must be bought, high-quality... I looked at some sites with frames, it was pleasantly impressed - it is cheaper than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $ 300 for them, the frame was of average level (or even lower).
I do not know what frames are in stores, but the prices in online stores are quite normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Still much.
We have multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive (this is comparable to our average salaries).
Given the budget of our family (especially the fact that it is necessary to hire housing), then $ 300 per goggles, then a fairly high amount.
Did doctors not offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then the intolerance of the lenses began, another year after that I wore hard lenses, a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
For 4 years I wear glasses constantly, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that Covid affects vision.
Also after 40 years, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $ 1000, is very expensive.
Yes, the glasses are now fashionable.
I asked one doctor why he does not wear lenses or not make himself a laser correction, so he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH - this is an unreal amount
I now have glasses mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mother has little working experience.
She worked little: at first, small children who often get sick, then cared for her grandmother... So the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnia and all these funds had to be paid for renting a home.
In good times (there were prizes before the Covid), but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide a family or buy a card, but then communication with their family is lost...
Yes, there are pluses.
But my husband, as it has a day off, then goes to the apiary)

According to the order from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over these seaports.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to service ships and passengers, to ensure the proper level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during the conduct of hostilities in these regions in these regions, which pose a threat to the life and health of people.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, this is reported by Reuters, citing a statement by the British Foreign Ministry.
‚ÄúThe UK Foreign Office on Sunday said that Russia uses a troll factory to spread disinformation on social networks about the war in Ukraine and politicians of certain countries, including the United Kingdom and South Africa,‚Äù the article says.
It is noted that these conclusions were reached by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of expert research.
‚ÄúThe department said that this study revealed how the Kremlin‚Äôs disinformation campaign is in force, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers,‚Äù writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory ‚Äúused Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who subsequently acted against the Kremlin‚Äôs critics, throwing their comments in support of President Putin and his war.‚Äù
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
‚ÄúTraces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok‚Äù, ‚Äì stated in the message.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Trus said on this issue that its government had already ‚Äúwarned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to destroy Russian information operations.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to break into our online spaces with lies about Putin‚Äôs illegal war,‚Äù Trus concluded.
Ivanna, now I'll explain to you.
You have such a hair structure that all hair is almost the same length.
Very few short slauses.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either do hair philating.
But it will greatly affect the density of the hair.
So I didn't.
Or make coloring of the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I did not paint the roots either.
Therefore, the transition may be a bit sharp.
I can flirte the transition, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows back the difference you will not notice.
About the quality of hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become drier, this is normal, because it is a blond.
Without loss of quality, such blonds cannot be done.
If you do the right hair care, and the condition of the hair will come to normal.
Please write what care from Matrix you use.
Maybe for blond he's weak.
We can sign up for a free tonnish to make a smoother transition.
This photo also has a rather sharp transition.
Because the large percentage of the blond in the basal zone.
Please write when you could drive so that I could watch.
If we do tone, it will take about three hours.
A lot of positive things from what I do in my job.
I help people - that's the most important thing and I wanted it.
In this way, but this is a help to people who almost no one in the world at all helps and will not say with a smile of the heart "good day".
I found today on the Internet wonderful basic lessons of learning the Czech language.
I'm here in the morning in the morning, where the homeless sleep, at this time I'm one and the door to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons in my headphones and repeat by the lecturer.
From the outside, I speak with myself, but it is good that at this time no one sees me and does not hear üòÖ I think an hour a day I will be able to learn the language.
So another huge positive of this work - learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
The longest peace period lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
10 of them were attacked.
Most of the modern territory of Russia at one time occupied nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural basis of the Russians.
The cult of conquest and raids was successful throughout the history of Russia: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then ‚Äì 20 years of the Putin regime.
These cultural features have formed state institutions that cultivate the policy of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of the war of conquest, because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
The standard of living in them has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand the tightening of sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from the inside!
Russia poses a threat to the new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
De-energized Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
Shelled from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over the South Ukrainian NPP in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits the attacking of nuclear power plants.
A rocket, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to power failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
It is not necessary to press the ‚Äúred button‚Äù to cause a planetary catastrophe.
Support Ukraine ‚Äì the Russian threat can be overcome only together!
The Russians are looting Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate surpluses of the surplus of the harvest of the past and this year" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take away the sowing material from the farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully carry out sowing, in order to then send new crops to Russia.
It prohibits to pay taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens physical violence.
Russia repeats the policy of the USSR from the mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920's.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property in the Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of the "liberation war with the Nazis", Russia in particular provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Don't buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country abandon any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children hostage.
They force their mothers to explore the locations of the Ukrainian military, for refusing they threaten to kill children.
People are pushed to a tough choice: to lose children or to become traitors to the Motherland and to be punished for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your government and the international community not to allow the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to enter NATO, but I do not like their indecision.
Due to the fact that Nato does not cover the sky over Ukraine, thousands are dead.
More than 50000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I have to say that it comes in insufficient quantity and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that it is beneficial to the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience of the war against russia, our army is the most capable army of Europe
Did you know that the Ukrainian was invented how to recharge the "one-time" anti-tank complex nlaw?
I think the Americans will knock down these warheads at the launch
The Russians deserve the worst and most gracious thing that can be imagined.
To some extent, I am glad that what is happening.
Because this war is not going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I definitely do not remember now.
But all these hundreds of years there is an attempt to make us their slaves.
One generation does not have time to die, as another is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already taken place, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
It is generally wild to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the transience of events, I did not even have time to comprehend, to reflect the very fact that there is a war and what it means to me
Here is super,but you need to learn the language and go to work I will not be able to sit on the maintenance of the Czech state,but the problem is that my husband does not want me to sew to work constant quarrels.and it will be necessary to return to Ukraine and could remain but he will do everything in order for us to go back.a very difficult situation
Doesn't want us to live here his answer
So he's happy that we are here, but so that I sit at home I myself took the children to school and go swimming , I ask that we stay here after the war and he says that we will immediately go home , he will not make us documents
I probably will not be able to leave if he has a long time, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Long slender
I want to start the war to study at the hairdresser and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he does not want then, for sure, it will be necessary to go to a lawyer.Now it is too early to do something.but here he clearly told us that after the war we are going home immediately.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when they lived in Ukraine, he said that he would take away)))I now know the truth
So .thank you.we will proceed from the situation ,the main thing is that the war is over!!!everything will be fine.!!!
No, at present he has no one for sure.I think the reason is that the children want a lot in the Czech Republic ask him to have toys then in the poppy donals to go, shout , runs throughout the house.and he is attracted to peace that no one bothers him and the lower does not ask.and here we came and everything irritates him and we need to spend money on us and he is very economical.
Behind the window of the train flew, dusted with small gray rain, Marchers and Christmas trees, sprinkled with black and white confetti forty, sad water and commodity.
Comrade operative Orlv was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from a narrow Spartan bed in his home.
He deployed a simple set of the seconded ‚Äì rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he has long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simple, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
He then leaned over the old reddish snacs and carefully took out the crystal dome with two palms, glittering in the gray light of the medium strip.
- What is it for you, comrade? ‚Äì terrifiedly asked the young cadet, his neighbor.
- Rareity, - with tenderness, unexpected for himself, said Comrade Orlov, reliably containing the skull on the compartment table - such, see, the thing... A very interesting and inflated thing.
This, we can say, my friend...
Yes, I watch the work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately I find a job for men, for special education.
I don't know the Czech language, I'm a young children's teacher, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And also a big question of housing to find.
I am for the first time abroad and just do not know what to do and how to act.
I can't find a job for a month, just cleaned in one house.
I understand that Prague has a very difficult situation, so I do not even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I am for the first time abroad, I don't know the language and I'm completely alone.
Me and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find any more work.
I ask people, look at the sites - nothing
I am going to attend this village.
One lesson on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is that I have to stay for free housing while it is.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit because the housing won't be free long.
I understand
I don't want to take the money from you.
I do not want to think about the lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a living room in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
A difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a large city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I can sew, I have to sew on a sewing machine.
I sewed bed linen and some clothes to order.
Maybe that work will be.
I can do that!
I hug and send congratulations to everyone!! üôèüèªroom posed by üíê
I am very happy to read you!
We have an air alarm again (((
Today more than 100 missiles üò° arrived in Ukraine
I worked with the wounded today, it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were near the child.
Jan at home studied...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We give this evil spirit!
In the surgical department, I and my colleagues volunteer
Sometimes it covers of course))))
Then I clean, cook, communicate))))
For this is my home, my land!
Congratulation to everyone - everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªupheld about it
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of removing or not removing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main one.
I'll give an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes a toy from another child, then most likely adults who look after children will try children to reconcile and for some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to shovel on the face of another, then such a child is isolated for a long time, and no one will play with it.
I liked the analogy of one Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from the next apartment kills someone, the whole apartment building is not put in prison.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there is a lot of discussion on the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain that they cannot withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to cooperate with several psychologists from Russia, whom I know, and share knowledge in order to treat the traumas of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who are trying to do many things at their level for the development of universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am exactly for a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia the war is supported by 5-10% of the population, and other figures in polls are drawn by propaganda.
My wife left Ukraine's homeland because there is a war going on.
His wife had a good job and no matter how war she never left her home.
In order not to sit in the Czech Republic around the neck, my wife tries to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate in Ukraine about the completion of the masseuse.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money who can.
Now the problem is just one thing to learn the Czech language.
The wife teaches and works and earns himself and the child for food, for a kindergarten, on a bus ticket, for mobile communication services for clothes.
And at this time I defend my homeland.
Thank you for supporting the people who understand this.
I thank the Czech Republic that in difficult times I provided shelter to women and children from Ukraine. üá∫üá¶‚ù§üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
I want to thank you for providing advertising to my wife for the provision of massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live for the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you
Thank you very much.
It really helps my wife to earn money for his family.
Well, I'll give my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at the announcement of my wife, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money, and not expects help from your republic.

I really need a person who could act as a translator in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were traveling in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance invited a person who, during the technical inspection of the car, can translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific work based on a statistical analysis of the parameters of the body of lizards of different ages and genders in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Center for the Rehabilitation of Bats as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor the populations of bats of the Kharkiv region, as well as to organize a winter for bats, which people disturbed in the cold season.
In the autumn of 2021, I also worked as a guide to the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in an important topic of biodiversity conservation for me.
At the Ukrainian University, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works about the quieters, to observe their livelihoods under a microscope and to communicate with scientists who study them.
Therefore, the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms is also of interest to me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees ‚Äì an analyst from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU ‚Äì this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has undertaken to solve many problems.
She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from neighbors ‚Äì Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äì and will be tirelessly grateful!
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and a financial burden, the ProUkraianiun editorial office asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland Helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.
In the governments of labor are long queues, a significant increase in prices in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government was organized exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
It was predicted.
In Poland, they have been said in recent months that there would be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, less prepared for what will happen, and in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine before the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine will be placed.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that I was smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare before the war for all these events.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics is movement through the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, among them medical, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that move through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience in cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is the size of the world is similar to Lutsk, not millions, as someone can think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians was canceled.
They can ride on trains and public transport for free.
In addition, Poland negotiated with German carriers that organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay for free.
The second issue is the residence of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes, where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
There is a free meal, free medical first aid.
Refugees have the opportunity to relax and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
Large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw, have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they have achieved from the Russian Embassy to take over the objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes for decades stood in a neglected state, but the Russians did not let anyone go there.
The Polish local government has nationalized this, let's say.
I took away Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings where 200-300 families can accommodate at once.
Water, electricity, they will be insulated.
Within a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step ‚Äì the Sejm adopted, and the Senate approved the law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS, get the code on the phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias free to get medicines in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys that are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various funds are common, including Caritas, Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemistry, clothing.
As the Poles say, "Niespotykana skala."
That is, "an event that has no analogues."
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, these are huge expenditures.
The European Union has not yet allocated any euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Linguistic problem.
Questions begin from clinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools where students, especially high school students, also at the beginning, do not give themselves a choice at all, can not understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the appropriate class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children have knowledge not only good at English, but also in general their level is higher than the class they enter.
It's interesting too.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are evaluated so high here.
Language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer in Ukraine, it is much harder to master this work here.
A lawyer or an accountant, I do not know such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing at certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
A language problem is often the cause that encourages families to go back home a few weeks later, to go back home.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the past few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees fleeing in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.
They did not get used to it, they did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, they will be more comfortable to return home.
This is also one of those problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, there were significant changes.
If earlier the Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively to be labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, along with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then there could be Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic countries, it can reach Poland.
That is, he if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians now defend Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and Poles appreciate it properly, so they open their homes, help so selflessly to Ukrainian refugees.
The threat in Poland is seen.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases, there is a certain fear that the war can also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to the positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is now not a ‚Äúsong of nationalists‚Äù or some enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are small groups among the population that did not change their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society are now thinking quite different about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about the nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that in Ukraine nationalists who need to be eliminated.
This in Poland is perceived simply with laughter, because these so-called ‚Äúnationalists‚Äù turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.
And this is probably impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in the public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in this way, as is happening in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talking here.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for a worse scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia is frightening that it will strike with nuclear weapons in punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How does the government and the Polish society react?
If you want peace, get ready for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States, other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, there is an additional recruitment in the territorial defense troops in Poland.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios takes place.
It is felt for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this and the recently adopted new law on the defense of the fatherland, where the budget is significantly increased by the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for the recruitment of the military, many points that are actually associated with a possible military threat have been changed.
I know you as a professional expert on the analysis of the future.
Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you have warned of an attack by Russia.
What do you say from the analysis of the situation: when is the victory of Ukraine and will the world be able to prevent nuclear war?
This is the worst scenario.
As for the nuclear strike, I don't believe much.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could have happened, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
I don't want that, but that's the worst-case scenario.
Shock of small power, but to show all the TV channels to show this ‚Äúfungus‚Äù.
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are associated with the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now very suffering from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of the fire of the hydroelectric power plant in Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to be indignant in prices.
Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia will split into 19 small countries.
We also have trends in the peaceful settling of war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
This will last as much as possible until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing the possible cessation of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is dependent on Russian gas by almost 100%.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I'm an analyst, I predicted it.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there are a huge number, millions of Polish families who will feel rising prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely the prices for all resources will begin to rise up.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there will be a ransom of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe had abandoned Russian energy carriers, it would be a loss of the source of Russia's financing of its troops.
Even the student understands, without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in the Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave interviews to the Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about it?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased a lot.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, speaks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in a war zone.
That is, the actions of the president are assessed by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities, as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are targeted as much as possible to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide refugees leaving Ukraine.
These topics are discussed in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media regarding some sabotage or regional problems.
This is not heard here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, the ability to fight the enemy has increased significantly.
He does not fade and does not fall.
This is the most important, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine is based, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to worry about my problems again.
I am not comfortable and ashamed to complain.
Yesterday they tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
The conflict was joined by the girlfriend of the mother-in-law who helped to find this apartment.
She said that she was looking for her not for us, and if something does not suit us and should leave and she will make it so that she would like my mother-in-law, and not us, to live here.
Unfortunately, none of them thinks for a child who is accustomed to this place, considers him his home, and in 3 months there are already 6 homes.
I'm very sorry, I couldn't guess that this situation would happen
Once again, sorry that I give you the trouble.
And as for the bed, the situation looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote that the bed was not needed.
He went here to me and to the child and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and spit she wanted in his opinion and desire.
I am very ashamed of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so for us
Understand.
I thought she was going on for some long term .
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and treatment Andrew to do it at least until the end of summer?
You may need a certificate for Andrew that he is sick .
In Ukraine with such a diagnosis would be prescribed disability..
And as Inna doesn't go to kindergarten yet, I don't have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
I understood, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow .
I'll make a bar code for myself and Andrew
I worry that they will stop giving humanitarian aid to him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a lot of time.
Can you advise anything?
I also wanted to ask if you received the money for the medicines that you bought for Andrew?
The handle grip falls out.
It's short, so you need to be very careful and not lose it.
Today, only 2 servings were sold.
The apricot is over.
Folded mango.
Mango is not going very much.
Most of the apricots wanted.
Now they take more vanilla because they do not like mango.
Norm, the mango went.
But began to creak again üò≠
Actively began to take ice cream and it does not copeüò≠
Tomorrow will be black currant
Today will definitely end mango , and black steno
I'm all shaken
He freezes again, creaks.
Hadnes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it does not let ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Just just the queue becomes behind the ice cream, it begins to give out such nuances and people go further.
Freezes .
If there is no ice cream, it will creak and rub the piston.
And the vanilla in the mango can not be poured.
Magdalena can come tomorrow at 8.00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today, the ice cream is over, and tomorrow a different taste.
