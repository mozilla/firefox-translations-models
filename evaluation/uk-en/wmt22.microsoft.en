I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that through the translator my thoughts in Czech differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Hello, I agree to the course.
However, tell me please, is there a time earlier?
Since I do not live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no options, then I still agree.
Thanks in advance.
In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived at the place to disperse.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders are also kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city ‚Äì ed.) are people who have pulled back a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it, too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... Every family has lost something ‚Äì and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing anymore, there's no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts became necessary to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows us to come to the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
"Everyone Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," reads the message.
The DIU notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders' troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and aerial bombs.

I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I learned from each situation for myself in order not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives shall be introduced in the form of numbered written supplements forming part of this Regulation.
I am sure that there will be no problems with this.

It depends on the religion.
Whether the person is a Greek Catholic or a Catholic.

In my daily prayers, I thank God and Our Lady for you.

My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come immediately after the war?
place, day and time will be specified in accordance with interests and opportunities
We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse of civilians north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century? How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was sadly waiting for is happening...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and have never doubted that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU allowed to remove a copy from the execution file of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-yard" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was sufficient to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even learn about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give false testimony were killed.
In the criminal case, there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
An apple from an apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls...
The firing squad that doomed the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like "Immortal Barak", qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Allegedly, files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and there he quickly died.
KGB officers are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
On top of the thousand-year-old Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then they did a brutal genetic experiment on what happened, slaughtering the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what can I buy for cough.
I'm sorry because I have no one to ask
I also wanted to ask, maybe you know where the children went, because Galya cannot find them
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (He's off and can go because the car hasn't been looked at at the station yet.)
We are very uncomfortable bothering you so much.
You help us a lot, thank you!!

I wanted more if I had time to look at the cake for Karina somewhere
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shakhova introduced me as a Fpoint employee, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
They asked you to convey congratulations and say that it is very interesting for them to read on the news.
We also talked about people of Roma nationality, what privileges they have in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if a child comes and parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.
I need to change bed linen, 2 sets.

On General ƒåapek, the turn is very slow there.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I do not know about Europe, but in our country people marry for various reasons, mostly for selfish, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with this, if I do not love a person, nothing will happen.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She was very thankful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said, if possible, maybe there would still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary . Only if there is. I am also very grateful to you .
I certainly felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions to God why there were situations in my life that just made me despair of everything.
Are small grocery stores open? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go, and you did a meeting
This is true, but we are not yet oriented in the area and do not know where everything is.We were looking for a supermarket today for an hour and returned on foot.Two blankets are not suitable,so two are needed in large sizes
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to communicate in Russian or someone else from the family?
You can have children come to Valya and play in the lobby
Oh well, let's take a chance then :)
I'm also glad I met you
I talked to Volodymyr about housing, consulted whether they would find me until they found me or look for it myself, the ladies living with us were told here that we need to go to the metro station, the museum station, there is an institution that helps to find housing;
For the sake of the little one, I will cross the barrier üòÇüôÉüòÇ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions
So it would be good for Thursday ,if you can
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license examination yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money in my account.
I can't top up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking, and my Ukrainian bank card can't be recharged.
In the vodafone application, I can neither change the tariff so that I have normal calls and the Internet, nor top up the number.
I'm already like crazy

I'm ashamed to sit without a job
Just wrote that at school in class
Sorry to bother, just worried a lot
But this is closer to leaving Ukraine to know for sure that they will arrive.
Because there now everyone has a question of life.
Yes. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not match. Everything must be measured
I am looking for everything for home and for children.
Thanks to people, they accepted me, I live in a chapel, they always thirst or need a shoto, and I'm ashamed to say, I ask myself to find it.
I just got home, now I have breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, please do that I'm not there
cannot be answered without a CV sent
I can't tell my mother this :)
And I really feel a little uneasy now that I could not keep myself from feeling before we left the apartment.... Like tonight....
God willing, Yura will fall asleep, maybe I will üôè immediately lie down, sleep a little.
I will write to you anyway.

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the version on the Boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles, citing the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

Tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman themselves solve issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are around.
Why not try this way for now
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

I was upset that Kolya and I didn't start translating the test well.
I will ask whether Hryhoriy Denysenko or maybe Jonashek)) that they help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up the mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope for this
And so she is very happy about any gift
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stand aside.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance

I didn't go. Yes, she baked herself. This is what I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews at Babyn Yar by German soldiers.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the foundation we must defend ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility linked to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities it has blockaded to death, and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" doesn't just mean speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens ‚Äì more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member countries ‚Äì for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership because of Russia's position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast "Damn Questions", together with the editor of European Pravda, we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia,  may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here

Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he proposed marriage to me, and died two days later.
Therefore, God Himself decided our destinies.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "they have never done this before"
According to Konashenkov: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles shot down by Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Pozniaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower in Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the occupiers' downed missile destroyed a house and a trolleybus at Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reiterated on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, there are many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on Russian territory in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the town.
Clearly, elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing cold sweats at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the skies of Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and before crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European nations who elect those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of power, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered fraudsters.
It is better to give the funds that you collect to people more in need.

These are heroic guides who go to the war zone without fear, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are communal services that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits to the front.

So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or not far from it.

The Foreign Constituency of Ukraine (HEI) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises at embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.

Only national voting is held in the Foreign constituency: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in higher education institutions are not held.

Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia was launching a "fake operation" regarding weapons provided to us by allies.
According to Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can spread fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from allies, and they are massively switching to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the next world.
Excuse me, please, forgot to ask how much a kindergarten would cost per month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage as evidence emerges that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are reprehensible," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The comments came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in Kyiv's Bucha suburb by Russian troops withdrawing from the area after occupying for weeks.
The photos, purporting to show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were indications that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "commissioned" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubt about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the U.N. Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
Russia's Investigative Committee issued a statement on April 4 announcing an "investigation" into allegations of Ukraine spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video address switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service saw bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people, all in civilian clothes, were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was being used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kyiv area, which until last week was controlled by Russian forces.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupiers viciously took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually put under the Russian military training ground.
Ukrayinska Pravda found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" takes place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their family.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under severe duress.
Thus, in Melitopol, Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Oleksandr got a job at the Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true scouts, Denys and Maryna packed their alarming bags in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Who is there?" ‚Äì I say yes. ‚Äì "Come out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "The Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war ‚Äì UP), helped us in the war, now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, with it was a big problem.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext "all equally Russian will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So after looting the store, they brought sausages and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought the chickens themselves, one tied a St. George ribbon to one leg and his white tape to the other and called it "militia".
They arrived at Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take away the killed, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had combined detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk paratroopers.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly hit it from Bayraktars.
But they came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exist, but there is Azov, and, according to them, there are 100 thousand Azov in Ukraine.
The "Kyiv already surrendered" narrative has been promoted since early March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an airborne officer or an FSB representative ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then feel sorry for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äì either Grad rockets or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to their homeland ‚Äì they say, "they will shoot you there, they will sell you for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, destroyed equipment, although Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the equipment directly to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A missile is firing, and you can see the trace ‚Äì it was Iskander working on Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His manager came, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, said: "Wot, I'm a crest, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stay until these of your crows are achieved.
Poor people suffer!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
As he says, he will."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "But you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread disinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the railway station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were accommodated in Minsk and escorted by us.
They did not hold them by force in the sanatorium.
The migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozyr said that Russians there were constantly shooting from training grounds.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was drafted.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their training grounds are used to shell Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian ones."
Maryna lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center you will not be able ?
Thank you, we have everything.And we are always waiting for you!
Thanks for the arrangement, bloodworms are good
And in this small apartment does not catch Wi-Fi, basically I answer all your questions, and now I don't know how to be?And children have online classes since Monday, but there is no Internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Or is it a family ready to welcome us?

Can we agree on how best to do it?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture, they found the elder of the village of Motyzhyn Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor and son Oleksandr, who were abducted on March 23.
The bodies of Olha and Oleksandr were in a mass grave, Ihor's ‚Äì in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I leave, there will be no one at home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and the package was not delivered, and the DHL website says that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the parcel was sent to the post office and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I pick it up?

She is very inattentive and somewhat irresponsible.
Either she will pass her stop, then she will forget her phone, or as she does not take the phone now and did not write to me that she is at school and that everything is ok :)

The charitable organization Archeparchial Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be of interest to Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, Russians rape women, their children are forced to watch it.

Hello, my thoughts are talking to you - you need to learn Czech, and I can not tear myself away from the news.
I communicate with you very often with thinking. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes European Pravda.
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it's done too late.
Because when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have looked different.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war," he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and return home

A woman from DameYidlo just called me and said that they sent me email information about further actions, but I did not give an answer.

But I don't have an email from Dameidlo

He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my own point of view on life I met him, then left him.
He was a very rich man, After a while he called and said that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and believed that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me
"There was a car in my yard, it looked like a crocodile, and hailstones.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And what about housing,that you dropped photos
I really haven't gotten there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already denied this fake.

"I tell her that the 'TV and radio repair' was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to blurt out too much when they call."
"For a whole month we hide information about the war from my mother-in-law.
So far, it succeeds.
However, Spotka (cat ‚Äì UP) has peeled off fur on his belly and hind legs ‚Äì this may be due to stress, changes in food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The speck, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga hears poorly and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived incognito in an apartment with her for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid both the war from her and the fact that I was nearby ‚Äì formally, as usual, I came for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always at the bedside.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She hears badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. That's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from beginning to end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaned :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)
Hello,if tomorrow more help is needed we can come

I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I will look for now.
I tell you the embassy is only here,
A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' marine brigade taking part in the defence of Mariupol, told his friends and family they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC, citing family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke with him
According to Eislin's Twitter: "We received news from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is taking part in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the soldier's mother, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brenan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone conversation, Aislin said about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called Kadyrovites without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Aislin allegedly speaks with an American friend he knows, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and on social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know you're having a hard time. But I would also like to know. Whether we are together or not.

One brother is at war in Mariupol, another is in Zaporizhzhia, and my husband was transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call every day saying that everything is fine, and who knows, they still will not tell the truth
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to settle some more things.
I will ask my husband in the morning if he will make it tomorrow.
When you get home, email me, please, I would need to communicate with Daniil.
The Bolshevik attackers recouped to the fullest for their losses in battle.
They shot teacher Dmytro Pavlitsky, his unknown relative, young man Borys Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep washing pit, which was covered with earth."
According to the memoirs, "there was some dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house.
On the streets there were always bodies tortured by the Bolsheviks:
And maybe I'll really go get you. I need you. I can't do it without you.
3. What activities would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you will not get there, because here is the reconstruction of the railway and the entrance is closed.
You will reach the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me that you have arrived and I will approach you
A better future awaits us

If I understand correctly, they will send us a letter from school to enter to persuade the menu

Okay, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we settle down tomorrow night, I'll pick it up on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, right.
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
It is strange that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere was... the place at which the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we are not aware of any company that needs to physically hold a supervisory board meeting at the address of location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
One that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then others may take off tomorrow ‚Äì for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, let us examine the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
MP, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned defense enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
There is only a supervisory board at UKROBORONPROM, which, in fact, manages almost all state-owned defense enterprises.
But even at UKROBORONPROM, according to the law, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in UKROBORONROM belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocate one or another defense enterprise, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because Draft Law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense enterprises.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the first word "war" leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war."
Firstly, it is manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically come here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims against members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

In the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
According to Pavliuk: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts that were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clean up and demine the territories.
Omelianiuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a word-for-word translation from that document into Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. I did it in another bank. Because you had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing its army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that a diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians, 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichy, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Rady Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Hennadiy Kazakevych, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the forceful support of SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to Viasna, during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was wounded and is in a medical facility.
Others were treated on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of BZhD and the administrator of the thematic resources of BZhD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The BYpol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to commit sabotage at Belarusian railway transport facilities and infrastructure within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, Russia is transferring manpower and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions on President Putin's daughters, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and banning all new investment in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is Russia's largest government-owned financial institution and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions would freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in US jurisdiction.
The detailed list will be published by the Ministry of Finance the next day on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of Russia's Security Council, including former Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the passage is closed and I will approach you
Vera, can we already wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant at SkyUp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to kindergarten.
We lived well, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because there is no longer strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that for the first time someone will come to us) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if we can afford it.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.

We will be grateful for such help at such a difficult time for us.
I had one lecture of English in the afternoon, and after that I went to work in the nursery.

Today is not my day. Blinds in the living room broke. In the morning alone. It's different tonight
Something came from you ,I do not see that
I am also very sad
Let me remind you of the texture later
Do you only have a father who speaks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Natalia Nahorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, published a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says they have no weapons left to fight and a mountain of wounded.
They said "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not contacted the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azov leader Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we stay here
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
That's not an important thing
She had forgotten what she would do here
A squadron ofüá®üáø Czech drones began flights over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve for detection, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to the Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones to their intended destination: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of copters, their locations will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian invader and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything was fine. I love sweets, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
Soon I will return to Ukraine, continue to work
Well. If all goes well, I agree
I will try myself , but if there are any problems I will write to you, if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally with the lady headman in the village in Jobov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will be delighted and her mood will rise
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I am also frozen outside.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I don't care what kind of musical overcoming üòä you have
Mom and Dad need to obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and rainy. Tomorrow should be warm.
But do not feel sorry for the destroyed houses, pity the people who are tortured by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was torn down.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, they gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given

If you still need help, write:
If I'm not mistaken, then you are celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't really want you to raise funds from the beginning, so people wouldn't think we were speculating on that!
But two points were not enough for me to fill out online:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good evening
üòÑüòçWhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will draw.

My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
Collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
Would love to be your backup designer.
How will I be credited with the day that I was not at work, there is a pass
Summary of headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "We cannot exclude provocative actions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen from this brigade are being recruited.
The enemy is experiencing a particular problem when recruiting drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovhenske and Dmytrivka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk sector, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the area of Zolote, was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The enemy carried out artillery shelling of positions of Ukrainian troops near the settlements of Vysokopillia, Trudoliubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of motor vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt it
And how can you sleep, and I hold you
Do you really mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thanks. We didn't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to set up :)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package expires today:)
Can we do it today by phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
My father and I will meet later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook ,then apparently Google wroteüèµÔ∏è something in its own way. , I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we took the things you brought, but there are things that are small on us, you can bring them in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then from next week I can start going to work, because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the labor office, submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues), and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working on Teva
Friends are old and not so much, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you, too.
Over the past month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why they are subjecting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, ‚Äì as usual, Sasha laconically replied. ‚Äì Now, after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äì those who have worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Meduza, Navalny's organization, and elsewhere ‚Äì have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except perhaps for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstractions?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent ‚Äì messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the tsar, be his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and making public the KGB archives, as the Stasi Germans did, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.
When faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option, and meekly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you either voted for it anyway or chose not to vote at all.
When he began to raze Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at that time, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Delusion, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the mid-zero economic recovery, driven by soaring oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices were rising, but is it trouble?
Moscow shone festively and shone with chic.
When several opposition figures ‚Äì Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others ‚Äì were killed, many of you were shocked and horrified by what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in subsequent years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you came out en masse to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified that it was losing ground beneath its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I heard it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who had deceived their European hopes, they captured the Maidan once ‚Äì and never abandoned it again.
They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they did not do their job well.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly a new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped communicating right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, like new ones since the restoration started by Moscow's mayor in 2012, with their binbags, public wi-fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I supposedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting in cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited it, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I kept silent because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent because I am not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done so.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äì as, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zygar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from inside the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians ‚Äî or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed ‚Äî he'll take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but for the most part, went out alone to protest and still held a short term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social media (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or spoke privately with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for a joke are not in such a distant past ‚Äì and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak out for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more so than in 2014, frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority may be on paper.
All things considered, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You understand where everything is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a hochma, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to leave somehow or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not ignite from you: because of the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is likely to ignite in provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle classes of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies by itself, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this great magical tool ‚Äì the Internet, which the mode can restrict, but which still works and that can be fixed under almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization has been crushed, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.
There are a lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand come out, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; Those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online ‚Äì and be arrested; Your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a damp cell under police clubs.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home
That you perceive me as a press secretary
Vico, how often do you go to dinner at an expensive restaurant?
once a rtik I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant
I'll try to explain everything to her)
Yes, we liked the very beautiful one and we wanted something closer, so this is the best option;
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. Tired energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, voice disappeared, weakness and my head is spinning
I have to go for that labor government
We have already done this, but we said who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
A pass is required for Thursday, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I was texted by a lady who liked your work and would like something from you in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform you.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought that I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity for lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am monogamous and take marriage issues seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
So far, I have not seen this.
Hello. Where in Jihlava can you buy Easter cake baking dishes (paper or silicone)?
Okay, thanks for the advice, then I will now add a certificate for Valya to the questionnaire
She has cerebral palsy in the supine state, her leg is now broken in a cast, the stroller is in a supine position, and the eda is all ground in a blender
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to bother you after hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I walked into Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child because she said that she had come to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
Can this really be so?
The working hours of the room are until 16:00.
And ultimately, it is our responsibility.
