And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
‚ÄîLetter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It is felt that they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our heads spin - how are you, s@ki, afraid if, for your greatness, you need someone to repeat about this greatness.
As you are not sure of yourself.
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent, who needs to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that everything works out for him, try very long and stubbornly for him and at the same time think when this painful abuse will finally end.
We repeat this in order to preserve us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because later, when these evil spirits are expelled from our land, we will need to put the city in order.
Whoever we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
Words that there is a smell of rot in the city.
We will probably need a lot of detergents to just wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they are big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood undressed on the street and only said loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dear.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We will still have a lot of things to do with you...
Then!
And one more thing.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's even hard for me to come up with the idea that they don't steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because postcards are constantly put up in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
And when they are close, the people of Kherson will deal with evil spirits with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
Let's wait.
Let's clench our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers are numb and wait.
Because we have something to look forward to.
To be once and for all.
And none of this evil spirits remained.
And then we will wash the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
The author of the written for obvious reasons is not indicated.
And I need communication. I completely soured something. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but still I do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with the accommodation?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help you better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who has provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian aid receives an invitation to research (from the invitation@click4survey.cz address).
The questionnaire is filled out by everyone only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will help a lot to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN

We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and seasoned professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but meetings are prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I will be grateful for practical advice and any help in my quest to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are strong.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So contact us.
I'll listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first aid payment of 5000 CZK, without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation ‚Äì to be considered unemployed, not to have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first payment of benefits will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies, then he will not be able to claim the payment of 5000 crowns.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This measure is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Only those refugees who prove immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will still be entitled to the payment of second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth benefits.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå As in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who have not been provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive cash assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "tourism for help", when a refugee lives in one country, and comes to the Czech Republic for several days exclusively for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application form for the payment of benefits does not match the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of assistance will be denied.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent UAH 2.626 billion on the payment of humanitarian aid. CZK.
And today I was engaged in the whole day digging defensive structures, and the whole city is digging in, something not very joyful forecasts for the near future.
To be honest, I'm tired, it's very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this we need someone to organize equipment and people, and I am the head of the village, so these are my duties
All utilities are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, otherwise we will not defeat the katsaps
Very big propaganda so that people despair and weaken the resistance
To be honest, I haven't picked up a shovel yet, I hope I don't have to.
My children stuck girls' stickers on my phone case so that I would not forget that I am feminine
What happens if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A government Commission will be formed from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will accelerate the revision of the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which of the permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will remove all "unnecessary" permits and procedures in an accelerated mode.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter whether the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è Business regulation by the state will be carried out on the principle of "one new permit minus two old ones".
Regardless of whether it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è In the behind-the-scenes mode, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the field of the environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be at risk!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We don't even know how and who changes the bylaws until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the opportunity to influence are business associations.
Draft law No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Tight deadlines for reviewing permits, an opaque procedure, and the absence of any decision-making criteria are a movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the
They told her ‚Äì grandmother, the Russians have approached the village; Grab your cat and climb into the bus.
But she refused ‚Äì what am I, an old mare... Save the children and girls, I'll be dead here... A woman goes down to the cellar, picks up cucumbers, rolls away a tub of trash, a pile of troughs; There are doors with iron bolts and silver locks.
And someone is rattling chains outside the door.
I didn't think, says the old woman, that I would live.
More than seventy years - and again the rod is broken.
Go - only not through the gardens, because I will curse you, You will bring us closer to "putin kaput".
A woman's cat hisses, glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and push between houses.
The Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Hello, go to the mail and confirm your identity through "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code must again be indicated in the registration on the Internet and you are done.
A bank card must be registered for the person who wants to receive financial assistance, another one is not suitable.
I did this, a friend also indicated that some kind of key was needed, but when she survived, waited in the government, they told her why she came, since she was already registered.
It was also shown, in this application, that some kind of key is needed, but in fact it is already being registered without it
Help me too, the application was made online on May 5, but something is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the government of labor or wait
It is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but it says that the identity is not confirmed, through the banking system gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelina!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of this term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Today's Russian war against Ukraine has been prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of the training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what was sometimes not learned during the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation for our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfumer" (P. S√ºskind), "Sin" by M. Kotsiubynskyi, "Letter from a Stranger" and "Wild" by S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works that he incense are not easy to perceive, they require the investment of soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, they are the way to recovery of modern man.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine. Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate him.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that at the end of the war they will again hear his playing on the saxophone, see his unsurpassed skill of reincarnation, and will be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals that are mined in our country include: hard and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we create a rational economy, an acute shortage can occur in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s. It was used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, glass, porcelain and faience, food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
There are considerable deposits of oil shale in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the marginal foothill troughs.
Coal.
94.3% of the coal deposits of our country are coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal ‚Äî anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used in the smelting of cast iron and steel.
In terms of explored coal reserves, Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and I place in Europe, and in terms of production ‚Äî XI and III place, respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Forecast reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the stage of Eurovision to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äì and the very next day, the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #–Ω–∞ Azovstal".
On the missiles that the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, it was written "For the children".
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to enemies.
At that time, it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like Ukraine's political course.
Russia must be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing met us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We bring insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot heat up.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode?"
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks warmly gave way.
Lviv
The city of Lviv lives.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body ‚Äì an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the windows of cathedrals boarded up with dictation.
It envelops monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war is not heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it is not heard in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier ‚Äì at 11 p.m., life hides from the curfew.
But it exists: when we were sitting in a caf√© at 9 p.m. and sounded the alarm, it could only be heard from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities ‚Äì through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people return and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Fragments of shells or machine gun bursts?..)
On the shattered balcony, the Ukrainian flag is stretched.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And three people are rummaging at this front door.
They clean, repair, build a wall and a new life with it.
And a mother and child are walking in the park two blocks below.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their dad survive the shootings of men in Bucha?
Will he walk with them again?"
At the exit from Irpin, there is a cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were mercilessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can smell a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow-motion air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.
And it's already been weeks since the death of passengers...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds of the same shots.
And in one of the cars there was an abandoned bicycle, in the other there was a warm children's overalls.
Somewhere there is a half-burnt booklet with instructions for using the airbag.
The remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, look back for the last look at the city ‚Äì and I come across the same bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried the baby in white.
This child in a white jumpsuit must have survived.
But is there a chance that a child who wore clothes abandoned in one of the cars also lives?
A man sits on a broken bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
He just sits and looks at the abyss between Kyiv and Bucha.
He does not take pictures, but only looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how is it?
"Happy holiday!" the man exclaims to us joyfully. ‚Äì "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, wartime Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not capture - the city is at war and lives.
At the corner of the streets, at every second intersection, there are neatly folded tires and Bandera stripes.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet ‚Äì the noise against which the city lived has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety.
People live "by candlelight", more precisely, by mobile phone flashlights.
At home, we only turn on the lights in the kitchen - quickly and as needed.
Grandmother covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light does not penetrate.
There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's bed.
"At hand from the 24th," says the father.
In case of air raids and explosion sounds, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a constant alarm mode.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "peonies" reach the Zhovtnevyi district, covering Kulbakyne.
Several times it flies close to my relatives.
To the next block, across the street from us.
Grandmother's neighbors - grandmother's windows were taken out, the children took them to themselves, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of the Ingulsky and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren wails on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple sits on a bench, chatting about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes by them.
We see each other with dad - what will we do?
"Well... Let's go have coffee?"
So we sit on Soborna Street (former Sovetskaya, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you off guard on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.
On the lawn at the entrance there is a huge trident - once from the Regional State Administration.
Nowadays, in the place where the trident flaunted, there is an empty "nothing".
Just like on the site of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed clearly on Kim's desk.
War takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under your feet.
I walk along the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor ‚Äì someone submitted requests and applications, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, let her live.
We met a guard who was at the post on March 29.
Survived.
"They darned it, sewed it up," he points to his head. "Already at work."
Only journalists can get into the Regional State Administration.
Together with us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.
According to official data, 36 people were killed.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv", "a monument to the Russian world", comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see it as a terrible emptiness.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transmission system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies in this way as early as July.
Russia used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been not just a commodity for Russia, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West is paramount.
Financing of the Russian economy is donations to the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent from Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime is intimidating Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience a shortage of fuel.
But this crisis will stimulate a more economical attitude to natural resources and increased energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as geopolitical weapons.
Temporary discomfort should be experienced so that the next generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
By this, Russia causes the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages may increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians are stealing already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroying agricultural infrastructure, and blocking sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the global economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation is launching an innovative hotline format ‚Äî the Diia.Business virtual center.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own stay, registering a business, finding a job, and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the Diia.Business virtual center is being launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you should be afraid of every important day, and how you never know a day or a minute that may come
Good afternoon, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time you can come for vaccination for Darusya.
It was supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come, because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged from Marina's car.
But the car panel says that you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia should bring it from Ukraine, and then it will be replaced for me
Tomorrow I will try to start the car, if it works, we will go alone, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I don't start, then I'll write to you and you'll come for us
It is very inconvenient for me to disturb you, distract you from work.
Okay, let's go with you at 11:45 so as not to take any risks.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they embark on together to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
The stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy that they could cling to during the many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people - emphasize the organizers.
At the end of each trip, you return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Returning home is expected.
The theme of war is ubiquitous, so our gait may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of growing antipathies and hostile moods in society, which are incited and exploited by the populists, we want to point out that unwitting travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic way and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Now they are part of it."
Despite such a painful theme, the parade still managed to make bright and encouraging.
Craftswomen and craftswomen had a hand in this, who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, motankas, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Kampa to Wenceslavak, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to the rescue - they cover children with their wings in the first place.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protecting wings is becoming even more active.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads in a column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, motankas, toys and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who have helped and are helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we can overcome this difficult path and security will reign in homes."
The wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He thinks to tell his wife why he has been gone for so long.
He rang the doorbell, poured the snails on the floor, his wife opened it, he, urging them with his hands, said:
"Well, here we come!"
We come in, we go in, we come in...
Our editors talked to a Ukrainian refugee Maryna, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
"Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist," the Ukrainian said.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries about relatives.
In a conversation with Maryna, a refugee from Ukraine, there is confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she finds herself with her children.
But the woman believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, not abandoning the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Maryna is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
"I am an architect of buildings and structures by education, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with honors.
Before that, I studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in design," Maryna said.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Maryna, without hesitation, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a shelter for the woman.
"Of course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what Czechs tell me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I am not ashamed to ask for help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
I thank them for this," Maryna shared.
According to her, in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, applying for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
Having received a visa of tolerated stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands...," she said.
"They didn't take us to the kindergarten because there were no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and no one knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but...," Maryna continues.
"In general, I am very worried about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses in peace.
Once I went to Czech classes with the kids, so they played a little, and then they began to behave restlessly.
I, as a normal mother, was distracted, I could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with small children, someone was there while studying... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Maryna added.
When the children are sleeping, Maryna is engaged in self-education, learning Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Maryna was browsing vacancies on the Internet and saw an ad: "As part of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC Representation in the Czech Republic "12 Stars for Ukraine", we are organizing a one-day art workshop at the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes and paints.
Only creative imagination is required from the participants..."
Marina couldn't help but take advantage of this opportunity.
"I plucked up the courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting, where we drew all day.
Before that, I didn't sleep, I was worried.
In addition, I haven't picked up a brush for six years," the Ukrainian said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works ‚Äì we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings," Maryna added.
30 applicants took part in the event, of which only 12 were chosen.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
"This is how life happens.
All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Maryna said.
"And now I am trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But something needs to be done...," the woman said.
Maryna owes the Czech Republic for hospitality and hospitality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to leave for safer territories.
On September 1, the school year began in Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war started by Russia.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took a blow in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These cities and villages have experienced active hostilities, atrocities by the Russian army, and in some places ‚Äî occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country from the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war ‚Äì the information war.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations assess the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from where the civilian population was completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks by the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is to blame for the war, it has no right to take any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and knock the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine withstand Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey

FC Minaj claims that this is a fresh photo from the last training sessions after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, at a training camp, there was a conflict between players of the Ukrainian football club "Minaj" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik".
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
The fight was then confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minaj, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
It seems that one of them was drunk and found fault with a hotel employee, and a Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but already on the floor where the Russians were staying, and in equal compositions.
The number of victims on the part of Shinnik only confirms the fact that the Russians are also "abandoning their own," the statement said.
The club claims that after the end of the fight, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the training camp, the main requirement of FC Minaj to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to accommodate Shinnik," the statement said.
Football journalist Roman Bebekh, who was one of the first to report on the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending an employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that representatives of "Minaj" approached the players of Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The quantitative advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boyfriend.
Yaroslavl stood up for him and defended himself.
There were five or six of us, there were many more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries are a dissection of the lip, a fracture of a toe and a suspected bruise of the ribs," writes Kommersant.
"I don't understand where Ukrainians could come from in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," Shinnik CEO Serhiy Kulakov was indignant in a comment to journalists.
Later, Kulakov told the Russian agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what does medicine for diabetics have to do with it
7 minutes ago
Injections, which are gaining popularity, help you lose up to 15% of your weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy slimming injections, which are used by some famous people, including Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social networks, admitted to using it.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type two diabetes can indeed promote weight loss.
Acting on specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to feel hungry, satiated faster, and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix or a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medicine, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating and gas.
In addition, losing weight quickly can lead to loss of facial fat and, in some people, to sunken cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
This effect was called "Ozempic face" by doctors, from the name of another diabetes drug that is also taken to lose weight.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine regained some lost positions

In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to restore previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhnyi, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce battles continue in the area of Vuhledar and Maryinka, where, according to Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are reliably holding the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and are taking measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhnyi said.
In a conversation with General Millie, Zaluzhnyi shared his concern about Russia's use of naval surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut after capturing Soledar.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut was "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, the evening summary of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night of February 11, the Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock on Friday evening until midnight, Ukrainian air defense destroyed two dozen Shaheds that the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile attack on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

The EU will strengthen sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
On the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the European Union will impose new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an emergency EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "for as long as necessary."
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, planes - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German chancellor once again stressed that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties to the military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to closely coordinate with partners the supply of weapons to Kyiv.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022 of support on the path to European integration.
At the upcoming emergency summit, the EU countries intend to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he stressed.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future is part of the European Union, the chancellor added.
The emergency summit of the European Union will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will take part in the EU leaders' summit.

Metsola called for giving Kyiv fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke, called for the provision of aircraft and long-range weapons to Ukraine.
"EU member states should quickly consider, as a next step, the provision of long-range systems and fighter jets that you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted," Metsola said.
According to her, the response should be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelenskyy, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the way to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
Winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union," Zelenskyy said in his speech to European parliamentarians.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself from "the most anti-European force in the modern world."
"They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with total war.
But for what?
In order to destroy the European way of life as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of all 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this," the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelenskyy will ask to speed up the supply of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelenskyy arrived in Brussels to get the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the publication's source from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelenskyy's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress."
"Therefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals," the interlocutor said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not a matter for the European Council, but for the decisions of the member states."
Zelenskyy is expected to voice Ukraine's weapons needs during the European Council summit and talk personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs, first of all, long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, analysts said in a February 8 report.
It also notes that geolocated footage of hostilities confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichne, northwest of Svatove.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are not yet allowing Russian troops to achieve significant successes.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after being deployed to Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the terms of battle, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative since August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts, this climax is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces that they can use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Maryinka and Vuhledar.

"There will certainly be offensive attempts in both the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia directions," he said in an interview with Reuters.
"How successful they will be will depend on us."

SpaceX limited the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
On Thursday, February 9, Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies must decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to a free life and Ukraine - and then they do not figure out how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its 'right' to kill, seize territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink shouldn't be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army actively uses to counter Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon."
"However, Ukrainians are using it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and this is normal.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," Reuters quoted the director as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX may "limit their ability to do this."
"There is something we can do, and we have already done," she added.
She refused to specify what measures the company took.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX handed over Starlink systems to Kyiv for free to provide the population with the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over this issue.
At the time, she estimated the funding needed by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at around $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company, Musk, said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US defense department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv against the backdrop of Russian aggression are developing "in waves" - they have "ups and downs".
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast person.
Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy," Zelenskyy said, adding that in the conditions of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Revival with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage, Germany's "conservative attitude" had changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had previously had difficulties, especially because of the so-called "Steinmeier formula," Zelenskyy said.
He emphasized that "good work" was done that made it possible to change the relationship.
"We received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky, Berlin has managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the President of Ukraine said.
He called the discussions on this matter "emotional and difficult".
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is needed not by us, but by Europeans," Zelenskyy explained.
Categorical about fighters
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began about the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here, Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will not transfer combat aircraft in any case.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as necessary."
He made the corresponding statements after a meeting with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

have already nominated a new prime minister - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, together with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrili»õa, resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the country's President Maia Sandu, Gavrilita said on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half of work in the government, it's time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, the fight against corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
According to her, during its work, the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought that we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed the national interest, but this was not the case. We worked in a continuous crisis mode," Gavrilita stressed.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to quit, citing only the lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for her enormous sacrifice and efforts", also noting that Gavrilita headed the government during the crisis.
"Despite the unprecedented challenges, the country was governed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcies," the Moldovan president said.

The Secretary of the Security Council may become the new Prime Minister
According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform duties until the new government is sworn in.
To replace Gavrilita, Sandu has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of Internal Affairs of the country, Dorin Recean.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Gavrili»õa was her representative, so voting for Recean should not be a problematic issue, AFP notes.
Recean has already stated that he plans to continue seeking Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, a breath of new life in the economy, as well as peace and stability," Reuters writes.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a complete blackout throughout the country as a result of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to stop them completely.
Chisinau called the reduction in supplies a political decision not related to payment issues.

What are the dangers of aftershocks?
Despite the fact that due to sub-zero temperatures in the region, there is less and less hope for saving people, rescue operations continue.
So, 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey, a family of six people was freed from the rubble, according to the state news agency Anadolu.
A total of 166 thousand Turkish and foreign rescuers, police officers, doctors and volunteers are involved in rescue operations.
Of these, more than eight thousand rescuers are from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
"White helmets" in Syria criticize UN for lack of aid
The United Nations (UN) estimates that about 5.4 million people were left homeless as a result of the earthquake.

In Turkey, almost 171 thousand tents have been set up in the region affected by tremors.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization White Helmets, who are carrying out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the White Helmets said that only two small international teams of volunteers who do not have rescue equipment arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, the region does not receive any humanitarian aid from the UN.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which works in London and reports on events from the rebel-held northern regions of Syria, noted that one shipment of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it lacks shelter tents and debris removal equipment.
About three thousand White Helmet volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey, as well as in northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced tremors of such strength was in 1939, when about 33 thousand people died.
In less than 12 hours, southeastern Turkey was shaken by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Decisive round of presidential elections takes place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus, on Sunday, February 12, the second, decisive round of presidential elections is taking place.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country, Nikos Christodoulides, and the former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN, Andreas Mavroyiannis, came out of it.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, his rival in the second round Mavroyiannis, who is supported by left-wing forces, scored 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Rally (DISY) party, Averof Neophyta.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, AFP notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current elections will serve as head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island, occupied by the Turks, proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots are participating in the elections - about 560 thousand people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote on them.

Energoatom reported a new threat to the ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
Petro Kotin, President of Energoatom, called the reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats at the ZNPP.
The decrease in water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level is 13.8 meters with a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives recharge for its generators, for turbine condensers and for security systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is rising slightly, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, began to discharge less water, at the same time the inflow at the top of the Dnipro increased.
The President of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at the ZNPP is sufficiently filled and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, according to him, "will be a big problem for the ZNPP."
Kotin stressed that the critical level will be 12 meters, the emergency level will be 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

Israel will step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader counteraction to those who carry out terrorism," Reuters quoted Netanyahu as saying.
This statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
The police shot the man dead at the scene, and arrested and interrogated members of the Palestinian family.
Israeli law enforcement officers welded the doors and windows in the house of the Palestinian family.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, writes AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was killed by gunfire during a standoff with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said that the rocket was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which has led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported to have died during them or during their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making this the deadliest year in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people died during Palestinian attacks on Israelis, AP writes.
Israel conquered the West Bank of the Jordan River and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600 thousand Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-time opponents, dpa writes on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two states, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu, held an unexpected meeting, at which, as Greek television cameras recorded, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu thanked Dendias for becoming one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to start dialogue again and solve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry stressed.
According to him, Athens "will do everything" - bilaterally, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay region.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara can be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as "earthquake diplomacy," helped to achieve a certain d√©tente then.
Conflict over islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for decades for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes,, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Are Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims with the flight of fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Ankara's warming with Armenia
Against the backdrop of the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing, closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for victims of the elements passed.
In addition, Armenia announced the sending of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and claimed the lives of more than 33 thousand people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.
As the successor of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, among others, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the backdrop of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation has only become more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers began in Brussels, during which a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format is also held on Tuesday, February 14.
On the agenda of the event is a further increase in support for Ukraine in the war and an increase in the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks," Reuters quoted him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long-term guidelines for the Alliance's defence planning.
"Allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Stoltenberg as saying.
What to expect from the ninth Ramstein
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group meets at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, in which Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov is participating.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join a special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 countries participating in the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide to provide Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that following this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations financed from the state budget of the Russian Federation to include them in the new package of EU sanctions.
This was announced in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
As Hryhorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is a strategic weapon of Russia.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum says very clearly that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation," says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, now a dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
For example, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough, and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on the European sanctions lists," says Hryhorenko and adds: "We are working to ensure that cultural figures of the Russian Federation who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, on the territory of the EU."
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels on February 9, noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

The United States is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland for $10 billion
The US State Department has approved a possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland worth about $ 10 billion.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
First of all, we are talking about launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility artillery rocket system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security goals of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In total, Poland has submitted a request for the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loading device module;
- 45 army tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipment for personnel, system integration support, engineering and logistics services for the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related elements of logistics and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also requested missile launchers from South Korea, the newspaper informs.
NATO Secretary General called on the United States to be prepared for Russia's long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to defend itself in the war against Russia is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
"The first step in securing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators who are capable of using them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We have started this process today," Sunak said of the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing has been removed from the agenda, and our leadership in this issue is something we should all be proud of."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine "next month" and said that Ukraine "must never again remain vulnerable to attack" and also called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term."
According to him, the UK agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10 thousand troops over the past six months, and promised, according to CNN, to "speed up the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's reach on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During a press conference, President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for Ukraine's support: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call for the provision of Western fighters to Ukraine and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already stated that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military-political consequences" for the whole world.
Currently, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia's full-scale invasion approaches its one-year mark.
I thanked you for the latest decision on tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others regarding combat aviation."
Yuriy Ihnat, spokesman for the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of Russia's expected new offensive in spring or even February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has already been trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

"Politics and profits" stand in the way of vaccination
The director general of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it will not be able to be ended.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective health care tools and effective medical tools.
But the world has not used these tools well," Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to achieving the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against the coronavirus are "politics and profits," the WHO chief said, "not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, must give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African Vaccine Purchase Fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created for the equitable distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people, without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!" - Ghebreyesus noted on the social network Twitter.
The WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and honor their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]" and become "much more transparent about what is going where."
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "exchange know-how, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
"The US administration trumpeted the vaccines it donated to the world.
But, when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it is not good-hearted philanthropy; This is supremacy.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; They asked for a fair opportunity from the beginning," the columnist said.
"We're not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we're calling for smart investment in the global recovery."
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce drugs analogues of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical companies, the EU, etc. opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported on Monday that it had recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that was "not easy to make."
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with CNN amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura K√ºnsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 aircraft would create a "serious problem" for Poland because, the Polish Air Force has less than 50 aircraft, and the Poles themselves "do not have enough of them... and we will need much more."
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it is not enough just to send a few aircraft."
These remarks by President Duda came amid discussions of new arms deliveries to Ukraine, including Western tanks and anti-missile launchers from a long time ago.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been urging its NATO allies to send Western-made Patriot installations and Western-made tanks such as German Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarked on an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelenskyy called combat aviation the "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelenskyy repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelenskyy said that he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on the provision of aviation to Ukraine would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders about the readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a number of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighter jets and other aviation.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelenskyy said.
As Voice of America reported, last week, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for the F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft may arrive in Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that weapons that the United States refused to supply ended up ending up in Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.

CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the Moldovan president announced Moscow's conspiracy to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, transfer the country "to Russia's disposal" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to forceful actions, attack some state buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not react to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has struggled to forge closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received the status of a candidate for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
Among them is a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply reduced gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents in recent months related to missiles that crossed the airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules for entering Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said that the Moldovan parliament should adopt bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office, "with the necessary tools to more effectively combat risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on a few internal forces, but especially criminal groups," and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile.
Last year, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions against both men.
Last fall, a series of massive anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, as Gavrilita's successor.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve its goals."

Stories from the war: "Grandmother with a red flag" threw him away when she learned about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª A living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine", a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, "bravely resisted the nationalists", is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her with products, but also protected ordinary Kharkiv residents from the wrath.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she came out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military so that they "do not crush Ukraine."
And in the aggressor country, her motives were distorted, which is why she now feels like a "traitor".
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military urges not to despise the old woman.
"Now, when Anna Ivanovna received a mine in the yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is fleeing in Poland, when she learned about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away," says the platoon commander with the pseudonym "Cadet"
The enemy creates conditions for an offensive on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih ‚Äì summary
The Russian military is conducting hostilities to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for an offensive on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.

Quote: "To increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern Military Districts and the Northern Fleet are transferred by rail to the areas bordering Ukraine."
Details: On the Volyn and Polissya fronts, the enemy did not conduct active actions.
There have been no significant changes in the situation in these directions.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There is still a threat of missile strikes by the enemy on military and civilian infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We are abandoning Soviet weapons and switching to NATO models ‚Äì Zaluzhnyi
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, had a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Quote from Zaluzhnyi: "We also discussed with my American counterpart a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, hold the occupied lines and positions."
"The one who invented this hellish summer was clearly out of his mind! Wild complained and stretched out her arms in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," Varta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice into the cocktail. "In autumn, because it rains and drizzle, the grasses rot.
In winter, because it is cold and the potion freezes.
In the spring ‚Äî because it rains again...
"I would sit in my own Carpathians," Varta shrugged her shoulders indifferently.
Although she did not particularly like the city.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, like a hundred years ago or earlier.
But there is no magic that would allow you to return to the past.
"Phew!"
You will say this! The wild woman slapped her palm on the table, and the vases of flowers timidly greened. "You would sit for a week in the meadow with my grandmother Rutmera with her colleagues, pray for every passing truck, that you would only be taken from there away to any city.
Unless you liked to weed the beds from morning to night, sort out the herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old orders.
Because the grandmother rested her horn that without words, none of my potions will be as it should be.
And wait, I haven't mentioned picking up all sorts of at night..
But where there, our white-handed, you would have died, even a week would not have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like this kind of "work", that it is their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you start really understanding this topic, it becomes scary...
Now the problem of involving Ukrainian women in prostitution is especially acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... Because of this, I did not treat him very well.
I think that we need to learn from the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model".
In this case, it is not the woman who is ordered, but the client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business", and not to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no more hope for anything.
Men should also consider whether they are buying "pleasure" or violence...
There is a need for something else... You can see where the nearest optician is with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a frame, high-quality... I looked at some sites with frames, I was pleasantly surprised - it is cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $ 300 for them, the frame was of an average level (or even lower).
I don't know what frames are in stores, but prices in online stores are quite normal.
But, as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Cabbage soup a lot.
In our country, multifocal lenses with glasses are very expensive (this is when compared with our average salaries).
Given the budget of our family (especially the fact that we need to rent housing), then $ 300 for glasses, then a rather high amount.
Did the doctors offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, I began to have a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics.
For 4 years I have been wearing glasses all the time, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that covid affects vision.
Also, after the age of 40, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $ 1000, which is very, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or do laser correction for himself, so he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH, this amount is unrealistic
My glasses now mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mother has little work experience.
She didn't work much: first small children who were often sick, then she took care of her grandmother... So the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias and all these funds had to be paid for rent.
In good times (before covid), there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy a car, but then they lose contact with their family...
Yes, there are pluses.
But my husband has a day off, so he goes to the apiary)
Good night
According to the order from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until control over these seaports is restored.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, ensuring the proper level of navigation safety and environmental protection during Russia's hostilities in these regions that pose a threat to human life and health.
The russian federation is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, Reuters writes about this, citing a statement by the British Foreign Office.
"The British Foreign Office said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and politicians of certain countries on social networks, including: the UK and South Africa," the article says.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came to these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
"The department said that this study exposed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers," Reuters writes.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters, who subsequently acted against Kremlin critics, bombarding them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok," the report says.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in this regard that her government has already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," Truss concluded.
Johnny, I'm going to explain it to you.
You have such a hair structure that all the hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or do root dyeing to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a little abrupt.
I can fuse the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be colored to match your color, so when the hair grows back, you will not notice the difference.
About hair quality.
Unfortunately, any bleaching affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become drier , this is normal because it is blonde.
Without loss of quality, such a blonde cannot be made.
If you do proper hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what kind of care from Matrix you use.
Perhaps it is too weak for a blonde.
We can sign up for free tinting to make a smoother transition.
This photo also shows a rather abrupt transition.
Because there is a large percentage of blonde in the root zone.
Please write when you could drive up so that I could look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
There is a lot of positive from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but this is help to people whom almost no one in the world helps and will not say "good day" with a smile of their hearts.
Today I found great basic lessons in learning Czech on the Internet.
I clean the rooms where homeless people sleep here in the morning, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons in headphones and repeat them after the lecturer.
From the outside, I talk to myself, but it's good that no one sees or hears üòÖ me at this time I think an hour a day I will be able to learn the language like this.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language with headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
The longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of invasion and raids has been successful throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural characteristics have shaped state institutions that cultivate policies of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of the war of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
The standard of living in them has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses a threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants.
A missile hit, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine ‚Äì the Russian threat can only be defeated together!
The Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and the first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate the surplus harvest of last year and this year" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take away seeds from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully carry out the sowing campaign in order to send new crops to Russia later.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens with physical violence.
Russia repeats the USSR's policy of mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
This is how the Holodomor began in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "liberation war with the Nazis", Russia, in particular, provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Don't buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
Their mothers are forced to scout the locations of the Ukrainian military, and for refusal, they threaten to kill their children.
People are forced to make a tough choice: to lose their children or become traitors to the Motherland and be punished for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine, Lyudmila Denisova, has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated an amendment to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Due to the fact that NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands are dying.
More than 50000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I must say that they come in insufficient quantities and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that the Ukrainian was invented how to reload the "disposable" nlaw anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
Russians deserve all the worst and most terrible things imaginable.
Therefore, to some extent, I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I don't remember for sure now.
But all these hundreds of years there has been an attempt to make us their slaves.
Before one generation has time to die, another is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have come back to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But due to the transience of events, I didn't even have time to comprehend, reflect on the very fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me
It's super here, but you need to learn the language and go to work, I won't be able to sit for the maintenance of the Czech state,but the problem is that my husband doesn't want me to sew constant quarrels to work.and I will have to return to Ukraine, but we could stay, but he will do everything so that we go back.very difficult situation
He doesn't want us to live here, that's his answer
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but in order for them to stay at home all the time, I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will go home immediately, he will not make documents for us
I probably won't be able to leave myself if he has a long job, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Prolonged beating
I want to study to be a hairdresser when the war is over, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he doesn't want to, then he will probably have to go to a lawyer.it's too early to do anything.but here he clearly told us that after the war we are going home immediately.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine, he said that he would)))well, now I know the truth
Yes, thank you.we will proceed from the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!! everything will be fine.!!
No, at the moment he has no one, that's for sure.I think the reason is that the children want a lot of things in the Czech Republic, they ask him for toys, then to go to macdonalds, they shout, they run all over the house.and he is used to the calmness that no one bothers him and does not ask for a lower one.and here we came and everything annoys him and you have to spend money on us, and he is very economical.so it is better for him that we live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train, birch forests and spruce forests sprinkled with black and white confetti, mournful water-tows and freight trucks, fluttered with fine gray rain, sprinkled with black and white confetti.
Comrade Operative Orlrv was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed in his house.
He unfolded a simple set of the business trip - rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old red-red bag and carefully took out the crystal dome with two palms, which sparkled dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
- What is it with you, comrade? The young cadet, his neighbor, asked in fright.
"A rarity," said Comrade Orlov with tenderness, unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, "such a thing, you see... A very interesting and flammable thing.
This, you might say, is my friend...
Yes, I watch the work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find a job for men, for special education.
I don't know Czech, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And also the big question is finding housing.
This is my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do and how to act.
I have not been able to find a job for a month, I only cleaned in one house.
I understand that Prague has a very difficult situation, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠, I am abroad for the first time, I do not know the language and I am all alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, I look at websites - nothing
In this village, I attend a course.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit around because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to affect others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
A difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a large city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
But to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of the children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have a learning to sew on a sewing machine.
I sewed bedding and some clothes to order.
Perhaps there will be such work.
I can do it!
I hug and send congratulations to everyone!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
I'm so glad to read you!
We now have an air raid siren again(((
More than 100 missiles üò° landed on Ukraine today
Today I worked with the wounded, so it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were with the child.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We will serve this evil spirit!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes it covers, of course))))
Then I clean, cook, communicate))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Congratulations to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of removing or not removing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
Let me give you an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, then most likely the adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after a while the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another in the face with a shovel, then such a child is isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the entire apartment building is not imprisoned.
There are many discussions among Ukrainian psychologists on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain they cannot withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to collaborate with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to treat the traumas of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who, at their level, are trying to do many things for the development of universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that 5-10% of the population supports the war in Russia, and propaganda completes the rest of the figures in opinion polls.
My wife left her homeland, Ukraine, because the war is going on there.
My wife had a good job and no matter how bad the war, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on the neck of my wife in the Czech Republic, she is trying to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as best they can.
Now there is only one problem: to learn the Czech language.
The wife learns and works and earns for herself and the child for food, for kindergarten, for a bus ticket, for mobile communication services for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
I am grateful to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in difficult times. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thanks
I am sincerely grateful to you.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
Okay, I'll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money instead of waiting for help from your republic.

Supervision of students in lessons, during breaks and at school activities school staff.
Safety conditions during your stay in the gym, playground and in professional classes
Distance learning rules
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
Personal presence of students at school, the school provides distance education to interested students.
If a distance learning method is ordered at school (class), students are required to do so in this way.
The most important safety rules
For school and school events, in particular, it is forbidden to bring things that threaten health and safety
weapons (including knives), drugs (drugs), cigarettes and alcohol.
Smoking and drinking alcohol or other drugs are prohibited at school and at events.
I really need a person who could act as an interpreter in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company invited a person who, during the technical inspection of the car, can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Tell me, can you help me with an interpreter?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works about tardigrades, observe their vital activity under a microscope and communicate with scientists who study them.
So the option of studying these and other microscopic organisms in depth is also of interest to me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees ‚Äì analytics from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from their neighbors ‚Äì Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äì and will tirelessly thank you!
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden, the editors of ProUkra—ónu asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has received up to half a million Ukrainians, and this has significantly affected the life of Czechs.
There are long queues in labor governments, a significant increase in prices in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
This was foreseen.
In Poland, they have been saying in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what would happen, and in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare for all these events even before the start of the war.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics - movement around the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that move through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had experience with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as one might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, travel fees for Ukrainians have been canceled.
They can travel on trains and public transport for free.
In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay for free.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to relax and stay for a few days, and already there, on the spot, they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created, have become very active.
The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they got the Russian embassy to take away the objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in.
Polish local authorities nationalized this, let's say.
She took it away in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water, electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted, and the Senate approved a law on refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines for Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS, get a code on your phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, get medicines in Poland for free.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are irrevocably provided to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various foundations are widespread, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, clothes.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is, "an event that has no analogues".
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.
The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
The questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems and diseases.
The second problem is schools, where students, especially high school students, also do not cope at all, cannot understand the terminology.
I would like to note that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children have knowledge not only of good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class they fall into.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master here.
A lawyer or an accountant, I don't know of such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians legally.
A language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks of being here, to return home.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active hostilities.
Here they did not get used to it, did not find a job.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it is more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one of those problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, he was in Tbilisi with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic countries, it can also reach Poland.
That is, he seemed to foresee it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, and their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this properly, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
Poland sees a threat.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to the positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is no longer a "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly insist that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is perceived simply with laughter in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is happening now in Ukraine.
They are constantly talking about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia is afraid that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How do the authorities and society in Poland react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent increased.
Currently, additional recruitment to the territorial defense forces is taking place in Poland.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this, a new law on the defense of the homeland was recently adopted, where the budget was significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for the recruitment of military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in analytics of the future.
Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you have warned of a Russian attack.
What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine's victory and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
Note, I wouldn't want that, but this is the worst-case scenario.
A blow of low power, but so that all television channels show this "fungus".
So that he could be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are associated with the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of the hydroelectric power plant on Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to be indignant at prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of the war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine due to their needs for Russian energy resources.
This will take as long as possible until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible suspension of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia has completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families who will feel the rise in prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe were to abandon Russian energy, it would be a loss of the source of funding for the Russian Federation's army.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its opportunity to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased significantly.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for his help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.
That is, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused on receiving military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity, which sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear it here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, and the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine is maintained, and this is very important.
Good morning.
I'm sorry to bother with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday we tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's girlfriend also joined the conflict, who helped to find this apartment.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, it is we who must leave, and she will make sure that it is the mother-in-law, and not us, who stays here.
Unfortunately, none of them thinks for the child who is used to this place, considers it their home, and in 3 months of shift, there are already 6 homes.
I am very sorry, I could not even guess that such a situation would happen
Once again, I'm sorry to cause you trouble.
And with regard to the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that a bed is not needed.
He went here to me and the child and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinion and desire.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, ≈†√°rka and Jan, the landlady.
You've tried so hard for us
Realized.
I thought that it was extended for some long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrei's treatment, to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Perhaps you need a certificate for Andrei that he is sick .
In Ukraine, with such a diagnosis, a disability would be prescribed..
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
Understood, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow .
I'll make a barcode for myself and Andrew
I am worried that they will stop giving humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a lot of time.
Can you advise anything?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicines you bought for Andriy?
The handle mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 servings were sold today.
The apricot is over.
I poured the mango.
Mango doesn't go very well.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla, because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, mango went.
But it started to creak againüò≠
They actively began to take ice cream and he can't copeüò≠
Tomorrow will be blackcurrant
Today will definitely end the mango , and the black smorot
I'm shakingüò≠ all over
He freezes again, creaks.
Hannes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take, he does not let ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
It's just that as soon as there is a queue for ice cream, he begins to give out such nuances and people move on.
Freezes .
If there is no one ice cream, then it will creak and rub the piston.
And vanilla cannot be poured into mangoes.
Can Magdalena come tomorrow at 8.00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over, and tomorrow it tastes different.

Maidan is a place where people protest
Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text independent Ukraine in 1990
He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine
Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and could not yet really understand whether they like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
when Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv, but there was still the city of Kharkiv in the Soviet Union from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if there was democracy in the beginning, it was much better, and probably now we were in the European Union
