In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
According to the participants of the event, the Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the russian military with equipment.
‚ÄúWe managed to hold a rally. Now the russian technician has arrived there," one of the participants of the event said.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered at protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This area is currently, like the building, controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against protesters and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents in the Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military is using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnapping the residents of the region.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, it will stop fighting ‚Äì we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
"Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It beats ‚Äì we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city's defenders ‚Äì ed.) ‚Äì people who pulled a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are more durable, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak in all these directions, we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...‚Äù
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity to a diplomatic solution if they are with us."
‚ÄúPeople will accept peace anyway because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something ‚Äì and I do not think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we're not talking emotionally, war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the sake of dust, when there's nothing else, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become necessary to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in the city. Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports on Facebook.
‚ÄúEvery Ukrainian should know their names!
The DIU received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Kyiv. Bucha," the message says.
The DIU notes that for the crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and will be prosecuted.
You can see the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages recorded massacres of civilians by the Russian military.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken out of the liberated from the Russian invaders of the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Bubble is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal bullying of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. It happens exactly what I was with sadness and waiting for...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that my family would not be spared in case of occupation of Kyiv's suburbs.
Because I was and I am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-red" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on hamlets and had several cows was sufficient to doom the pachar and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false evidence.
In the criminal case there is the name of the Knuckle Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far from, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio, which was doomed to the execution of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources on Russia like "The Immortal Barracks", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD players have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers ‚Äì the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that on the computer found files with child pornography, for it was put in prison, and there he quickly died.
KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Over the one-year-old Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16-19th centuries were imposed.
And then over what happened, made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.

According to "European Pravda", it is reported by Welt with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
How are also offered howitzers in the version of the Boxer BTR for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in the battle have to be drawn relatively close to the enemy's goals, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr in the shortest possible time will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full delivery will not be completed by 2027.
And this is we in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?

So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "a common basis for international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this basis ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúfor us, the Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The struggle has to continue.‚Äù
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of the cities blocked by it and lets them die from diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that not so long ago it was impossible to imagine.
Germany delays the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" It means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you night
We agree, negotiate for the tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of the Crimea and the beginning of the war of Donbas, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO carries out in the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and members of the countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Gathered Issues" podcast, together with the editor of "European Pravda", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at the talks with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think here

I had a sincere feeling to this man, but he did not do very decently and I left him.

I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to him, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started problems at work.
His support helped me in the time.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "previously did not do such a thing"
Direct speech of Konashenkov: "We see attempts at sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army was previously abstained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that shot down the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building on the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valeria Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the russians hit a TV tower on Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying over the South Railway Station, flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the occupiers smashed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a russian missile hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person, 19 others were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vynohradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early for the residents of the capital who evacuated from the city.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unbroken ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to carry out a number of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin throw in a cold sweat from the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to none of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of force, touching and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" against weapons, which the allies are handed over to us.
Quotes Yermak: "They understand that they lose the war, see their backwardness and seek to "kill" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense station transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will call one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it is massively moving to the Russian army.
I want to warn such fakes immediately.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the appearance of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of murdered, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are guarded by convicts," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The claims came after the appearance of reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dropped into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photos showing the bodies of executed civilians with hands tied up were shocked by many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "military crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far that they had committed "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected the accusations as a "provocation."
She said, without evidence, the United States and NATO "ordered" an image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also without evidence stated that the image of Bucha is "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provoke of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement in which he announced a "investigation" on charges of spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a "genocide" in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being enforced," Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with hands tied behind our backs and beheaded, I do not understand," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of allegedly civilians.
In one place alone, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The casualties were killed from close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupiers vilely took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
This list contains another item, which is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the enemy territory.
Around mid-March, the russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainska Pravda" found the Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text adhered to the voluntary-compulsory evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keeping in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children from there without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Valie moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civil.
As true scouts, Denys and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses did not take anyone.
At about 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke both not in Russian and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They say, "Afluence that?" I say yes. ‚Äì "Walking!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot, not even troops, young boys of 25-35 years.
They said: "Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi helped us in the war (commanded by the nationalist movement of UNA-UNSO "Viking", who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we lack.
We say that the water, it was a big problem.
They smashed the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all Russian wandering" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one particularly wanted to speak, but they did a beautiful slicing.
Our child says there, "You have 7 days to give our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They were constantly separated from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, they support Ukrainians and generally good ones: "Putin is a genus, Kadyrov, too, but we can not do anything, because there are our families there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looting.
The kurai was brought to himself, one was tied to one leg by St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äì its white tape and called it "militia".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked passwords to find out whether their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by Omsk troops.
They supplied 30-40 units of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktars.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces are no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, "Azov" so thousand 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an paratrooper officer or a FSB representative ‚Äì and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they answered, "Pretend the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from the house ‚Äì either by Grads or mortars.
And then flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer them to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland ‚Äì they say, "you will be shot there, to the authorities to be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were ashes, broken equipment, although Belarusians told that the russians immediately took out the equipment to them.
A lot of capori, turban equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, gave tea.
And here we hear the shots! The missile is being fired, and you can see a trace ‚Äì Iskander worked on Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonka" near Gomel.
Its leader came, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, says: "Vot, I'm Khohol, I'm Chernigov.
But I remember that Putyn and Lukashenko should not be found, why do not forget your wreaths.
Bedny people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
"Here'll tell me, so it will be."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called so) spread disinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate, they did not help us anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
In the sanatorium was not kept by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the missile first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly shooting from the training grounds there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their landfills are used to shell Ukraine.
Friends who took us to Estonia were waiting in Poland.
Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are so many Ukrainian flags now, probably as Estonian."
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of the next house.
Mary herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center you can not?

On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said good news ‚Äì the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from the Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment wasted by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied arms and shot at the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
The starosta of the village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor's husband and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were killed and with tracks.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor ‚Äì in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians were trying to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Pravda".
"All the equipment, all they are already sending, for some types of equipment, is done too late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed the position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked that Ukraine received enough weapons to make the difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have had a different look.
"She would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war," he added.
Earlier, EcoPolitic wrote, that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine a new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

I asked me to talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and believed that I could be his toy and maybe I needed my money.
And then he made me an offer

"I tell her that "repair of the TV and radio" was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to mow the excess when they call."
"We have been hiding from the mother-in-law of the info about the war for the whole month.
So far, it succeeds.
However, in the Spot (cat ‚Äì UP) on the lower and hind legs, fur was cut off ‚Äì it can be from stress, a change in food and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The starfish, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment for a month with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, like a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
From it, they hid both the war and the fact that I am near ‚Äì formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver ‚Äì she listened to 4 hours, then she sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time her mother-in-law spends in her room.
He hears badly ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", hid in my room.
First of all, she hid a receiver and a TV from her.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
Asked to talk to her about anything, just not about war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow did not think about it :)

The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter-page Aidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to members of Eislin's family and friends, Atlas News, citing the words of Aislin's friend, who spoke to him
Literally, Eislin's twitter: "We received the news from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We don't have food and ammunition left.
Thank you to everyone, I hope that the war will end soon.‚Äù
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of a serviceman En Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they planned to surrender.
Military Brinan Phillips's friend also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Islyn said about the plans of their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Reporters atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the detachments of the so-called "Kadyrovites".
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed in social networks, in which Eislin allegedly speaks to his friend's American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eislin said they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nominimum Cossack Gundi.

Very interesting tradition, we go so for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... the place for which the meeting is held by the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making of the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about the large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that needed to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì this is a great basis in order to "destroy" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why should state-owned companies supervisory boards and who should enter them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans one malicious bill "flying", then tomorrow they can take off and others ‚Äì for example, you can demolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and draft law 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another circulates among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to resolve the issue of management of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation with the risks of Internet loss and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the move of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Thus, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the possibility of making decisions from the loss of the supervisory board, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (OPC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the law, the Supervisory Board has a fairly limited authority, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronnom is the general director, who, by the way, will decide on the need for relocation of a particular enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro also cites arguments on his Facebook page that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respectful foreign experts at the first word "war", in 2021, leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, it is manipulation ‚Äì most such members of the supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, unfairly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express any any claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a reinforced curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Direct speech of Pavlyuk: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew is strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional service, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move around transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to the shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clean up and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last every day from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously accepted the prediction of possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling unit near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyy—ë Svaboda", human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "Belta"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of SOBR special forces, three residents of Babrusko were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Appoint", during the arrest, the men resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovyvtsi branch of "BJD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BJD" in "VKontakte and Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime, continues to urge Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferred to fight, to Ukraine, manpower and equipment.

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, imposes new sanctions against Russian President Putin's daughters, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their whereabouts.
‚ÄúThis step is based on the decision made by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was to limit against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including ex-president and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.
You can get to this place only, then the passage is closed and I will come to you
Wera, can we already wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war, I worked as a flight attendant of SkyAp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to the kindergarten.

Something came from you, I do not see what
I'm also very sad
Let me remind you of the texture to you later
Do you only have a dad and understand the Russian language?
What day does a colleague want to make cleaning the house and how many houses have windows?
I'm embarrassed that distract you from your business
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is a news from Mariupol for a son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published on the morning of April 12 video, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they did not have weapons to participate in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that "an account goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that on April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi assured that there is a connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin to Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is being held by the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, so far, we are here
2 driving time )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important thing
She forgot what she would do here
The squadron of the Czech üá® pereisignera drons from today has begun flights over Ukraineüá∫üá¶.
Almost 50 professional copsers will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invadersüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountainous friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
For the purpose of the most effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment is currently left to be secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what was done, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.
I return to Ukraine soon, then work
Good. If it's all right, I agree
I will try it myself, but if there are problems, I will write to you, if you can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally to the lady of the starosta in the village of Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there is no home
Perhaps she will be happy and she will rise in the mood
I was repaired the phone today.
And I think that today I also froze on the street.

I'm interested in what you have musical overcoming üòä
Mom and Dad Should Be Listened to
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It was cooler and rain today. Tomorrow should be warm.
But it is not a pity that destroyed houses, the harm of the people over whom the occupiers are mocked
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons ripped off the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers thwarted portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we do not have this custom therefore, we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given

Since I repel from the days and time in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for April for a month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For May - I can roughly say in late April or early May.

From the very beginning, we did not really want you to collect funds so that people do not think that we are speculating on this!
But for online filling, I did not have enough of two points:

Collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How I will be counted the day that I was not at work there is a pass
Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of the personnel of the battalion tactical group from the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory), 29 combined military army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the specified brigade are recruited.
The enemy feels a special problem when completing positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disabling them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the northern fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By forces, to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, was unsuccessful and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the area of Zolote, was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to have time, but I doubt
And how can you sleep want and I will keep you
Don't you mind that I'm coming?
maybe you just no desire to see you today, tell me, I understand everything)
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, and even more so 1+1. We do not need to adjust :)
I turn on the TV here exclusively to listen to the Czech language
I have an end today's tariff package for a month :)
Can we do it today by phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare the material in this area.
I will ask her. I am a bit ashamed to ask, she gives us so much cakes.
Only then we will meet with my father, be sure üôèüèª
I read the announcement on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in his own way. , I think the phone numbers are enough
Good afternoon, what things you brought took, but there are things that are small on us in 10 minutes you can bring them to you?
I thought about the work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start working next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the labor bureau until lunch (if it comes, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study the Czech language to know perfectly, I dream of working in Teve
Friends are old and not very, friends, with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you also have hard times.
I have been talking to many of you in the last month.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have confessed to being guilty and ashamed because of the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of why they are subjected to Ukraine on your behalf.
Over some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha replied laconicly. ‚Äì Now after the search, we go through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äì those who worked at the Memorial, in Novaya Gazeta, on "Echo of Moscow", in "Medus", the organization of Navalny and in a number of other places ‚Äì have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except for participation in rallies, when they still took place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, to be silent late"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a big burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you to some extent possessed freedom and democracy ‚Äì a messed even bloody but real one.
But 1991 was not the best in 1917.
Why do you ever have a revolution, you eventually come across such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king, let his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think that it is safer next to him. Why so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the staff, you took your soul away at the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option ‚Äì and humbly resigned to robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to equalize Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned his eyes.
I remember those years well.
I worked in Chechnya at the time, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and with my own eyes saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes at the weekend I returned to Moscow and cheered fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the murdered children, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Bred, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of the zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found a better job.
Prices are rising, but it's a trouble?
Moscow shone and shrilled with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
But then it was not.
When, after two terms, Putin passed the post of President Medvedev, and he took the seat of the prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's reign, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored this or were silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in a cafe and in Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we did a lot in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what is the reason that Russia is blatantly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was fine.
After the tough 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency as before, many of you decided that it was too much and you were massively protesting.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't walk from the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under your feet.
After that, he struck in response.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received a huge time.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and still hear.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
They were angry with the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan ‚Äì and never left it again.
They completely erected a tent camp and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of fingers, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against, but there is little benefit from this.
And how much of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From someday suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shaki suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adored him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were new to hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely like new after the restoration, which was started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 ‚Äì with their binges, the public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so good ‚Äì and it becomes only better.
You've barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or what is there... Even the Moscow editor, who released my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview then, because I supposedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself how on the streets of Homs the state snipers of the cold-blooded people of my children.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are known to the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, but I was silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came to the members of the unions, but I was silent ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense.
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really speak now ‚Äì as, for example, Dmitry Glukhov, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new Gulag or making a company to Navalny.
As for others, you know best in which country you live.
Therefore, I am sure, you understand that when Putin deal with the Ukrainians ‚Äì or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed, he will take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly went out to the protests and still took place in a small term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for an anecdote, remained not in such a distant past ‚Äì and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more than in 2014, ‚Äì frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that the mind, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how oppressive his superiority may be on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.
But you, my friends, know well what's going on now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on the alert.
You know what everything is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your election is just a hohma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still there.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see some other option.
And yet there is another one.
Which will eventually collapse this regime.
And maybe in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: because of the economic collapse that is looming on Russia, it will most likely light up in the province, in small towns.
When prices will soar, and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will go to the streets.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of intellectuals and middle-classes of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies by itself, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äì the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be established under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You are a lot, you are millions.
Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300 thousand, it will be stunned.
Will we have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he make them in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel the understandable fear; those who have children will fear them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would be afraid in your place, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dares not only to demand freedom, but is really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet ‚Äì and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a raw camera under police tansy.
That's what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's over.
Act in a cold blood, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were on Friday in the class, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home
What you see me as a press secretary
Wiki, how often do you go to dinner in an expensive restaurant?
once on the nit I go to dinner in an expensive restaurant

On Thursday, you need a pass, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I wrote to a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and I will definitely inform.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity for lost time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I am a person and I take the issues of marriage seriously.
There was one man for whom I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family people should love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't met that now.
Good day. Where in Yigava can I buy baking molds (paper or silicone)?
Well, thank you for the advice, I will now make a certificate to Valya in the questionnaire

Mr. Reyharde, I'm sorry that I am bothering you in idle time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the playroom to Natalie today, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valeriy yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
Can it really be so?
Working hours of the room until 16:00.
And finally it is our responsibility.
But I do not have a sinker does not open the page very weak Internet
