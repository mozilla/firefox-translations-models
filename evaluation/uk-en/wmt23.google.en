Criteria for admission of children to preschool education do Kindergarten, Prague 8, U Kindergarten 8 - for the academic year 2022/2023
The decisive factor for admission to preschool education is the applicant&#39;s actual place of residence, in the case of foreigners - the place of residence, in the relevant school district of the Ministry of Health, at the time of submitting an application for preschool education at the Kindergarten, Prague 8, at School Garden 8.
Another criterion evaluated is the child&#39;s age.
Children are accepted in stages according to the criteria below until the kindergarten capacity is filled.
And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names...&quot;
‚ÄîLetter from the occupation.
Kherson.
‚ÄúNatasha, we are holding on as hard as we can.
It feels like they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are great, that they are strong, and that we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our heads spin - how can you, s@ks, be afraid if, for your greatness, you need someone to repeat this greatness.
How insecure you are.
It&#39;s like having sex with an impotent man who has to repeat endlessly that he is strong, that he can do anything, it&#39;s a very long and stubborn time for him to try and at the same time wonder when this painful torture will finally end.
We repeat this to preserve us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because later, when this evil spirit is driven out of our land, we will need to put the city in order.
No matter who we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
Words that the city smells of rot.
We&#39;ll probably need a lot of detergent just to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time. Because everything these rascals touched smells of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone from approaching her to help.
For three hours she stood naked on the street and just said loudly:
&quot;Don&#39;t come near me, my dear ones.&quot;
Don&#39;t put yourself in danger.
Please!
We will still have a lot of business with you...
Then!
And more.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It&#39;s even hard for me to imagine that they don&#39;t steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children&#39;s toys and ending with a box of rotting vegetables.
They are afraid because leaflets are constantly being posted in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
And when they are close, the people of Kherson will deal with the uncleanliness with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they hurry.
And we will wait.
Let&#39;s wait.
We&#39;ll grit our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers go numb, and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And none of this filth remained.
And then we&#39;ll clean up the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names...&quot;
The author of the writing is not indicated for obvious reasons.
and I need communication. I&#39;m really upset. I know that few people want to communicate with upset people, but I still don&#39;t lose hope.
How satisfied are you with your housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar issues are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help us better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who provided a functional email address when requesting humanitarian aid will receive an invitation to participate in the survey (from the address invitation@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled out by each person only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
,PRODUCTION MECHANIC
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics, or modern medicines ‚Äì none of this would exist without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to join our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology, and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with residents to discuss important, pressing issues, but gatherings are prohibited by law because the country is at war.
I would be grateful for any good advice and any help in my quest to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are strong.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So please contact us.
I&#39;ll listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the conditions for paying humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first aid payment of 5,000 CZK, without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation - being considered unemployed, not having any property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first payment of assistance will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily multiple meals, and hygiene items, he will not be able to claim the 5,000 kroons payment.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food, and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This event is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The right to receive cash payments of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth assistance, as before, will be reserved for only those refugees who prove immediate need (lack of work, etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first point, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily multiple meals, and hygiene supplies will be able to receive cash assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of &quot;aid tourism&quot;, when a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs of a change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address on the application for benefits does not match the address listed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she actually lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of assistance will be denied.
To date, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion CZK on humanitarian aid.
And today I spent the whole day digging in defensive structures, and the whole city is digging in, so the predictions for the near future are not very encouraging.
Honestly, I&#39;m tired, it&#39;s very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this someone needs to organize the equipment and people, and I am the village headman, so these are my duties.
All utility companies are involved, and we are also contacting farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We need to unite, otherwise we won&#39;t be able to defeat the katsaps.
Very big propaganda to make people lose faith and weaken resistance
To be honest, I haven&#39;t picked up a shovel yet today, I hope I don&#39;t have to.
My kids put girly stickers on my phone case so I wouldn&#39;t forget I&#39;m female.
What will happen if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A government commission will be formed consisting of representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries, and business associations, which will urgently review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will quickly remove all &quot;unnecessary&quot; permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter whether the Cabinet&#39;s decisions contradict current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è Business regulation by the state will be carried out according to the principle of ‚Äúone new permit ‚Äì minus two old ones‚Äù.
Regardless of whether it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è Behind the scenes, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the environmental sector.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be under threat!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We don&#39;t even know how and who changes the bylaws until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the ability to influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short deadlines for reviewing permits, an opaque procedure, and the absence of any criteria for making decisions are a move somewhere east, not towards the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the reverse
They told her ‚Äì grandmother, the Russians have approached the village; Grab your cat and climb into the hut.
But she refused ‚Äì what am I, an old mare‚Ä¶ Save the children and girls, I‚Äôll be killed right here‚Ä¶ The old woman goes down to the cellar, shoves cucumbers in, Rolls out a barrel of junk, a pile of troughs; There the door ‚Äì iron bolts and silver locks.
And behind the door someone is rattling chains.
&quot;I didn&#39;t think,&quot; says the old woman, &quot;that I would live to see this.&quot;
Seventy-odd years - and again the rod.
Go - just don&#39;t go to the cities, because I&#39;ll curse you, You&#39;ll bring &quot;Putin kaput&quot; closer to us.
The house cat hisses, the glass in the windows cracks.
Tanks rumble and slide between houses.
The Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads emerges from the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your identity through &quot;check-in&quot;, then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and you must enter this code again during online registration and you are ready.
The bank card must be registered to the person who wants to receive cash assistance; another one is not suitable.
I did this to a friend, and she was also told that she needed some kind of key, but when she persevered, she waited at the government office, where they told her why she had come because she was already registered.
It also showed her, in this application, that some kind of key was needed, but in fact the registration was already taking place without it.
Help me too, I applied online on May 5th, but I can&#39;t figure out whether to go to the labor office or wait.
It says that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but it says that your identity has not been confirmed, the banking system gives an error.
Good afternoon, dear Ms. Angelina!
I would like to express my point of view regarding the use of &quot;in&quot; / &quot;on&quot; in relation to the word &quot;Ukraine&quot;.
The use of this term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
Russia&#39;s current war against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy.
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for the clear explanation of grammar, and for the pleasant communication.
We would like to thank you especially for the technical support of the training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what we sometimes did not learn in lectures.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in the Ukrainian language, including &quot;Lolita&quot; (V. Nabokov), &quot;Perfumer&quot; (P. S√ºskind), &quot;Sin&quot; by M. Kotsiubynsky, &quot;Letter from a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Wild&quot; by S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works he presents are not easy to perceive, requiring the investment of soul and heart.
The author intentionally brings the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, a path to recovery for modern man.
Has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of &quot;People&#39;s Artist of Ukraine&quot;, Laureate of the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mikhail&#39;s talent hope that after the war they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his unsurpassed ability to transform, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art.
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
Therefore, their location is closely related to the structure of the earth&#39;s crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals mined in our country include: hard and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, and oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully satisfies its own needs in hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we create a rational economy, acute shortages can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissya.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, and at enterprises in the glass, porcelain, and faience, and food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, feed, and yeast.
There are significant deposits of oil shale in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in marginal foothill depressions.
Coal.
94.3% of our country&#39;s coal deposits are hard coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
Ukraine has deposits of the best grade of coal ‚Äî anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking coal.
After special processing, it is used in the smelting of iron and steel.
In terms of explored reserves of hard coal, Ukraine ranks 8th in the world and 1st in Europe, and in terms of production, 11th and 3rd place, respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
The Russians like to write &quot;messages&quot; on the shells they drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
For example, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to rescue the soldiers blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äì and the very next day the Russians wrote on the shells ‚ÄúKalush, as you asked! #toAzovstal‚Äù.
The missiles with which the Russian military fired at the train station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, had the words &quot;For Children&quot; written on them.
Then, 61 people died from shells with cynical inscriptions, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared during the First World War.
During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
Back then, this helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on shells by Russian soldiers are a cynical and cruel gesture by the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don&#39;t like Ukraine&#39;s political course.
Russia must be stopped so that similar &quot;messages&quot; do not reach any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
&quot;We&#39;re carrying insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it can&#39;t heat up.&quot;
&quot;Is it possible to go through the control in an accelerated mode?&quot;
The border guard allowed us to stand at the front of the line, even the trucks kindly gave up their seats.
Lviv
The city of Lion lives.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body ‚Äì an endless flow of people.
People from all regions of the country found shelter and a sense of security here.
Some go further to Europe, some return home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the boarded-up windows of cathedrals.
She wraps monuments and sculptures in white cloths.
But the war cannot be heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices sound simultaneously, nor can it be heard in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life quiets down earlier ‚Äì at 11 pm, life hides from the curfew.
But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 pm and raised the alarm, it could only be heard from a warning on someone&#39;s phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities ‚Äì Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
People return and rebuild their lives despite the pain.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shot fragments or machine gun bursts?..)
A Ukrainian flag is stretched on a shattered balcony.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And there are three people milling around near this front door.
They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And a mother and child are walking in the park two blocks down.
I can&#39;t help but ask myself: &quot;Did their dad survive the shooting of the men in Bucha?&quot;
&quot;Will he still walk with them?&quot;
On the way out of Irpin, there is a car cemetery.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were mercilessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of &quot;patriotic tourism.&quot;
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can smell a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow-moving air, it feels like it could be cut with a knife.
And it&#39;s been weeks since the passengers died...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds of other similar shots.
And in one of the cars there is an abandoned bicycle, in the other there is a warm child&#39;s overalls.
Somewhere, a booklet with instructions for using the airbag has burned out.
The remains of someone&#39;s everyday stories and someone&#39;s lives.
We drive on, I look back for one last look at the city ‚Äì and my eyes come across the same bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, and here, right on these broken slabs, a Ukrainian soldier was carrying a baby in white.
This child in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wore the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
A man sits on a broken bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sits and looks at the abyss between Kyiv and Bucha.
He doesn&#39;t take pictures, he just watches.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge and thinks: how is that?
‚ÄúHappy holiday!‚Äù ‚Äì the man shouts to us joyfully. ‚Äì ‚ÄúHappy City Day!‚Äù
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1,540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South, and my hometown.
A frontline city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not be captured ‚Äì the city is fighting and living.
On street corners, at every other intersection, there are neatly stacked tires and Bandera stripes.
Evening Mykolaiv is incredibly quiet now ‚Äì the noise against which the city used to live has died down.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And it is extremely dark at night.
Camouflage for safety.
People live &quot;by candlelight&quot;, or rather, by the flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we only turn on the lights in the kitchen ‚Äì quickly and when needed.
Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets that kept out the light.
There is a hunting rifle next to my sister&#39;s crib.
&quot;On hand since the 24th,&quot; says the father.
When we hear air raid sirens and explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time anymore.
Even in a frontline city, living in a state of constant anxiety is very difficult.
When then should we live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from the &quot;Peonies&quot; reach the Zhovtnevy district, covering Kulbakyne.
It flies close to my family several times.
To the next block, across the street from us.
To the grandmother&#39;s neighbors - the grandmother&#39;s windows were blown out, the children took them to their place, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren is wailing on the central Sobornaya Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, chatting about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes by them.
We&#39;re looking at Dad - what are we going to do?
&quot;So... Let&#39;s go get some coffee?&quot;
So we are sitting on Sobornaya Street (formerly Sovetskaya Street, by the way) in a park near the monument to Saint Nicholas.
What else can I do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there&#39;s often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I&#39;m looking at the regional state administration building, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Nikolaev resident.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident ‚Äì once decorated by the Regional State Administration.
Now, in the place where the trident once stood, there is nothing left.
Just like at the location of the office of the head of the regional state administration and a dozen offices around it.
The missile landed squarely on Kim&#39;s desk.
War takes on a completely different shape when it&#39;s not in the news, but under your feet.
I walk through the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone submitted requests and applications, but now it doesn&#39;t matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, let her live.
We met a guard who was on duty on March 29.
Survivor.
&quot;Mended, sewn up,&quot; he points to his head. &quot;Already at work.&quot;
Only journalists can enter the Regional State Administration.
With us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.
According to official data, 36 people died.
This is &quot;September 11 in Mykolaiv style&quot;, &quot;a monument to the Russian peace,&quot; comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even if Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, the people of Mykolaiv will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has started a new &quot;gas war.&quot;
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May, to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to block natural gas supplies via this route as early as July.
Russia used this kind of blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the primary goal is to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing the Russian economy is like donating to World War III.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But the EU needs time to become energy independent from Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is intimidating Europe with an imminent energy crisis and a lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience fuel shortages.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude towards natural resources and increased energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort is worth enduring so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy mature crops of grain and oilseeds.
By doing this, Russia is causing hunger to spread throughout the world.
The Russian war could increase the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages by more than 40 million.
At the same time as destroying Ukrainian crops, the Russians are stealing already harvested grain from Ukrainian grain elevators, destroying agricultural infrastructure, and blocking sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine&#39;s agricultural potential is another manifestation of the Russian Federation&#39;s military aggression.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the global economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it can&#39;t continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Affairs is launching an innovative hotline format ‚Äî the virtual center Diya.Business.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their stay, registering a business, finding employment, and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the virtual center Diya.Business is being launched to provide all the necessary answers remotely until Ukrainians can return home.
It&#39;s scary how you have to fear every important day, and how you never know the day or the minute that might come.
Good afternoon, Hanna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when Darusia can come for vaccination next time?
They were supposed to be there tomorrow, but I can&#39;t come because I need to replace the battery in my car, it will be there by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged it from Marina&#39;s car.
But the car dashboard says the battery needs to be replaced.
My husband bought a battery and Anastasia is supposed to bring it from Ukraine on Wednesday, and they will replace it for me here.
I&#39;ll try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we&#39;ll go ourselves, I&#39;ll leave my grandmother in the car and won&#39;t turn off the engine.
If I don&#39;t start, then I&#39;ll write to you and you&#39;ll come pick us up.
I am very uncomfortable bothering you, distracting you from work.
Okay, we&#39;ll go with you at 11:45 so as not to take any risks.
&quot;The war is not over yet, and the fates of our new neighbors are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure they are going on together, only to be put into hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults, who still don&#39;t quite understand why their parents stayed home.
The stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy they could cling to during the many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip, return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip hasn&#39;t ended even after more than eight months.
Returning home is expected.
The theme of war is omnipresent, so our walk may seem redundant.
On the contrary, in the face of growing antipathies and hostile sentiments in society, which are being incited and exploited by populists, we want to point out that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and, thus, apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it.&quot;
Despite such a painful topic, the parade still managed to be bright and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, skeins, houses, and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Kampa to Wenceslas Square, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
&quot;It was very important to me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now,&quot; says the playwright. &quot;Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.&quot;
The luminous birds are the first to come to the rescue - they cover the children with their wings first.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protective wings becomes even more relevant.
Children&#39;s voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spreading like wildfire.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, and bobbins, and toys, and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and safety will reign in our homes.&quot;
A wife sends her husband to the market to get snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and goes on a drinking binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers the snails, goes to the market, buys snails, and comes home.
He thinks about telling his wife why he has been gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, pours snails out onto the floor, his wife opens it, he, urging them on with his hands, says:
‚Äî Well, they&#39;ve arrived!
Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go...
Our editorial team spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
‚ÄúNow I am trying to realize myself as an artist,‚Äù the Ukrainian woman said.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries about loved ones.
In a conversation with Maryna, a refugee from Ukraine, there is a sense of confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she and her children find themselves.
But the woman believes in her abilities and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without abandoning the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is originally from Nikopol, in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children ‚Äì a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
‚ÄúBy education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with honors.
&quot;Before that, I studied at an art school, graduated from a lyceum with a degree in &quot;design artist,&quot;&quot; said Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without hesitation, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a refuge for the woman.
‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs a new city, big, crowded‚Ä¶ A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what Czechs say to me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
Besides, I am not ashamed to ask Czechs for help and have never felt any aggression from them.
&quot;Thank you to them for that,&quot; shared Marina.
According to her, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time in resolving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, and submitting documents for benefits.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
After receiving a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
&quot;Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.&quot;
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands‚Ä¶‚Äù, she said.
&quot;They didn&#39;t take us to kindergarten because there were no places.&quot;
They say that we need to look for adaptation groups for children, but no one knows specifically where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in kindergarten, calling a number of different agencies, but‚Ä¶‚Äù, continues Marina.
&quot;In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can&#39;t say that the children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses without any worries.
One day I went to Czech class with the kids, they played for a bit, and then they started acting restless.
&quot;Like a normal mom, I was distracted, I couldn&#39;t study properly... If only there were language courses for adults with children or if someone was there with little ones during the lessons... But my daughter is so attached to me,&quot; the woman sighs.
&quot;Of course, together with the children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which a big special thanks to the Czech Republic,&quot; added Maryna.
When the children are sleeping, Marina is engaged in self-education, learning Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day, Marina was browsing vacancies on the Internet and saw an ad: ‚ÄúAs part of the initiative of the Association ‚ÄúSpolek Zaedno‚Äù with the support of the EC Representation in the Czech Republic ‚Äú12 Stars for Ukraine‚Äù, we are organizing a one-day art workshop at the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes and paints.
All that is required from participants is their creative imagination...&quot;
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
‚ÄúI gathered courage and applied to participate.
Everyone was invited to a meeting, where we drew all day.
Before that, I couldn&#39;t sleep, I was worried.
&quot;Besides, I haven&#39;t picked up a paintbrush in six years,&quot; the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings were created on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
‚ÄúThe subject of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works ‚Äì we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
&quot;That&#39;s why the collection of paintings is dominated by blue and yellow colors,&quot; added Marina.
30 applicants participated in the event, of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation, supported by the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
&quot;That&#39;s how life goes.&quot;
&quot;All your previously acquired knowledge and skills can come in handy, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic,&quot; Maryna noted.
&quot;And now I&#39;m trying to realize myself as an artist.&quot;
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we have to do something...&quot;, the woman said.
Marina is grateful to the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end soon, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in southern Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to leave for safer territories.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, rebuilding their infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took the brunt of the attack in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These cities and villages have experienced active hostilities, atrocities by the Russian army, and in some places, occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after active fighting and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are rebuilding their homes and public spaces.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new phase of this war - information.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report: Ukrainian military personnel are setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, it ignored the fact that it only refers to facilities from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks from the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, is seizing its territories, killing and torturing civilians, and destroying cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war; it has no right to take any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and drive the enemy out of occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand against Russia on all fronts!
I&#39;m sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe me or not, I am no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be right next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I would definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a wonderful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees.
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I will be able to go to work, go shopping, or just travel with my family, wherever our eyes take us.
My ideal house would have at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workspace, and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and dressers.
There will be many interesting books in the bookcases in the office.
The living room would become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could gather together, share news, or just have fun.
That&#39;s why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, a few armchairs, a dresser, a huge TV, and a long built-in aquarium.
Also, my ideal house would have an attic where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
There would be a pool behind my house with a few hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just play different team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal house would be big and cozy, beautiful and lovely.
I would really like to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hello, how many people should there be so that I know which room to prepare? Is it the only one?
I handed the letters over to you by my secretary.
Yes, of course, I&#39;m asking how many of them there are so I know where to put them.
Sure, tell me right away so I can know.
To have time to clean the room
Also, tell me how to send a parcel to Ukraine. My daughter-in-law is due to give birth on the 6th and probably needs our help. She is now left alone. At a time like this, I cannot leave her without support. She is my only granddaughter.
Products, diapers.
I&#39;m just going to bed on June 6th.
I was released from the maternity hospital for only 10 days.
I didn&#39;t have time to buy everything for the child.
There&#39;s no bedding yet, just a blanket.
Yes, they should know. I hope they find it. The main thing is not to panic because right now I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m ready to go and search on my own, but they won&#39;t let me into Donetsk. There&#39;s heavy fighting there right now and I don&#39;t know how the search will go. It&#39;s hard.
So the last words I heard from him were that I was a hard worker and it was good that I took my sisters and brothers and that they were safe.
I have to hold on to my children, they are what keeps me going. They are my hope and support. I have nothing else but them. They are everything to me. I am happy that I have them.
My whole body is numb, I don&#39;t feel anything at all, I can&#39;t even walk, I&#39;ve never had anything like this before.
Yes, thank you, I can&#39;t go there today, another time, I need to calm down and collect my thoughts, I have a lot of thoughts.
&quot;A fight of equals.&quot;
How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey
31 minute(s) ago

Photo caption,
FC &quot;Mynai&quot; claims that this is a recent photo from the last training session after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, a conflict occurred during a training camp between players from the Ukrainian football club &quot;Mynai&quot; from the Premier League and the Russian &quot;Shinnyk&quot;.
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams happened to be staying.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict, which occurred on February 13.
The fight was later confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC &quot;Mynai&quot;, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Apparently, one of them was drunk and was picking on a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
&quot;The fight did indeed take place, but on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal numbers.
The number of casualties on the Shinnyk side only confirms the fact that the Russians are also &quot;throwing&quot; their own people, the statement says.
The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued fighting among themselves, and local police had to intervene.
&quot;Before the start of the training camp, the main requirement of FC &quot;Minai&quot; to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
&quot;The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to accommodate &quot;Shinnyk,&quot; the statement says.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player protecting a female employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but claims that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza Telegram channel writes that representatives of &quot;Mynai&quot; approached the players of Yaroslavl &quot;Shynnyk&quot; and demanded to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
&quot;The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boy.
The people of Yaroslavl stood up for him and defended him.
&quot;There were five or six of us, there were many more Ukrainians,&quot; a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
&quot;The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, and among the injuries were a split lip, a fractured toe, and suspected bruised ribs,&quot; Kommersant writes.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand where the Ukrainians could have come from in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine there,&quot; said Shinnik CEO Serhiy Kulakov in an indignant comment to journalists.
Kulakov later told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what is the point of diabetic medicine?
7 minutes ago
Injections that are gaining popularity help lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, including Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social media, have admitted to using it.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type 2 diabetes can indeed promote weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person feels hungry less often, feels full faster, and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix or a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment is carried out under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and exercise.
Like any medicine, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating, and gas.
Additionally, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of facial fat, and in some people, to sagging cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors have called this effect &quot;Ozempic face,&quot; after the name of another diabetes drug that is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine regained some lost positions

In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to regain previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, during a conversation with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians are carrying out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vugledar and Marinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are reliably holding their defenses.
&quot;Despite constant enemy pressure, we continue to control Bakhmut and are taking measures to stabilize the front line around this city,&quot; Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with General Milley, Zaluzhny shared his concerns about Russia&#39;s use of naval surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
After capturing Soledar, Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut for his troops was &quot;developing successfully.&quot;
On February 11, the evening report of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and the night of the 11th, the Russians attacked critical Ukrainian infrastructure in several regions.
As reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o&#39;clock on Friday evening until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen &quot;shaheeds&quot; that the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to tighten sanctions against Russia on anniversary of invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union will impose new sanctions on Russia on the anniversary of Russia&#39;s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, in a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an emergency EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine &quot;for as long as necessary.&quot;
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provides Kyiv with the greatest financial support.
&quot;In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe,&quot; he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized &quot;public bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, aircraft - who will demand even more.&quot;
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German Chancellor once again emphasized that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties to a military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to closely coordinate with partners on the supply of weapons to Kyiv.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022, about support on the path to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the European Union countries intend to confirm their commitment to Ukraine&#39;s European path, he emphasized.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future lies within the European Union, the Chancellor added.
An extraordinary EU summit will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will participate in the EU leaders&#39; summit.

Metsola called for giving Kiev fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 02/09/2023
European Parliament President Roberta Metzola called for providing Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke.
&quot;EU member states should quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter jets you need to defend the freedom that many take for granted,&quot; Metsola said.
According to her, the response must be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
&quot;Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union,&quot; she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the path to EU membership.
&quot;We are approaching the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
&quot;A winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union,&quot; Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European parliamentarians.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against &quot;the most anti-European force in the modern world.&quot;
&quot;They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with a total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European path as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, the 27 countries of the European Union.
&quot;We will not allow this,&quot; the President of Ukraine emphasized.
Zelensky will ask to speed up weapons deliveries
The day before, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to gain the support of the European Council and accelerate the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As a source from Zelensky&#39;s front-line diplomatic team reminded the publication, during Zelensky&#39;s visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received &quot;an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally travels to other capitals,&quot; the source said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, &quot;of course, such decisions are not the business of the European Council, but of the member states.&quot;
Zelensky is expected to voice Ukraine&#39;s needs for weapons during the European Council summit and speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union&#39;s member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine primarily needs long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 02/09/2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatovo-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased noticeably over the past week, according to an analyst report dated February 8.
It also notes that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the Dvorichny area northwest of Svatove.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preventing the Russian Federation from achieving significant successes
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are so far preventing Russian troops from achieving significant successes.
ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet put into operation parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
&quot;Although Russian forces in Luhansk Oblast currently hold the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces set the terms of engagement, ending the Ukrainian initiative period from August 2022), the full engagement of these forces could lead to their eventual culmination at the Svatovo-Kreminna line without achieving the objectives of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts,&quot; the report says.
Analysts predict that this climax could likely create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces that they could use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning briefing, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupyansk, Lymansk, Bakhmutsk, Avdiivka and Novopavlovsk in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Marinka and Vugledar.

The day before, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, suggested that a new Russian offensive, predicted in February, could take place not only in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but also in other directions.
&quot;There will, of course, be attempts to attack both in the Kharkiv and Zaporizhia directions,&quot; he said in an interview with Reuters.
&quot;How successful they are will depend on us.&quot;

SpaceX has limited the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones via Starlink - DW - 02/09/2023
Advisor to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podoliak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war unleashed by Russia.
In this way, he reacted to information that Elon Musk&#39;s company had limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
&quot;Companies must decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to a free life and Ukraine - and then they will not think of how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its &quot;right&quot; to murder and seize territories,&quot; Podoliak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink should not be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using to counter Russian aggression, &quot;was never intended to be used as a weapon.&quot;
&quot;However, the Ukrainians are using it in an unforeseen way that is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and that&#39;s normal.
&quot;But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes,&quot; Reuters quoted the director as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could &quot;limit their ability to do this.&quot;
&quot;There is something we can do, and we have already done,&quot; she added.
She refused to specify what specific measures the company had taken.
SpaceX &quot;bargained&quot; with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX provided Kyiv with free Starlink systems to provide the population with internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked it to take over the matter.
At the time, it estimated the required funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, as well as in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company, Musk, announced that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to cover the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv are developing &quot;wave-like&quot; against the backdrop of Russian aggression - they have &quot;ups and downs.&quot;
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
&quot;By nature, I am a fast person.
&quot;Others are acting more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy,&quot; Zelenskyy noted, adding that in a war situation, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people&#39;s lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Air defense revival
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage, Germany&#39;s &quot;conservative attitude&quot; changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
&quot;Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had previously had difficulties, especially because of the so-called &quot;Steinmeier formula,&quot; Zelensky noted.
He emphasized that &quot;good work&quot; had been done, which allowed for a change in relations.
&quot;We received the IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
&quot;They saved many lives,&quot; the President of Ukraine noted.
According to Zelensky, Berlin has managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Previously, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate surrounding the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has returned relations with Germany &quot;into a difficult phase,&quot; the Ukrainian president noted.
He called the discussions on this issue &quot;emotional and complex.&quot;
&quot;I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is needed not by us, but by the Europeans,&quot; Zelensky explained.
Categoricality regarding fighters
After allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began regarding the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany would under no circumstances transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the Chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv &quot;for as long as necessary.&quot;
He made relevant statements after his meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

a new prime minister has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, along with Prime Minister Natalia Havrilica, has resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the country&#39;s President Maia Sandu, Havrylica reported on Friday, February 10.
&quot;After a year and a half of working in the government, the time has come to announce my resignation.
&quot;We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, the fight against corruption, and integration into the European Union,&quot; she said.
According to her, during her tenure, the government &quot;faced energy blackmail.&quot;
&quot;They thought we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but that was not the case. We were operating in a continuous crisis mode,&quot; Havrylytsia emphasized.
She did not specify the reasons for her decision to resign, citing only the lack of &quot;support and trust at home.&quot;
Sandu thanked the prime minister &quot;for her enormous sacrifice and efforts,&quot; also noting that Havrylytsia led the government during a period of crisis.
&quot;Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was governed responsibly, with great attention and selfless work.
&quot;We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy,&quot; the President of Moldova said.

The Secretary of the Security Council may become the new Prime Minister
According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
To replace Gavrilica, Sandu has already proposed her security advisor, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of Internal Affairs of the country, Dorin Recean.
His candidacy must be approved by parliament, in which the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, notes the AFP agency.
Recan has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova&#39;s membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be &quot;order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, as well as peace and stability,&quot; Reuters writes.
Due to Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a complete nationwide power outage due to Russian attacks on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to completely cut them off.
Chisinau called the reduction in supply volumes a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

the number of victims reached 23 thousand - DW - 11.02.2023
Earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have killed more than 23,000 people.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Health, as of Saturday morning, February 11, the number of victims in this country alone exceeded 20.6 thousand, and more than 80 thousand people were injured.
Read also: Turkey will continue to be shaken.
How dangerous are aftershocks?
Despite the fact that due to sub-zero temperatures in the region, the hope of saving people is becoming less and less, rescue operations continue.
Thus, 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey, a family of six was rescued from the rubble, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police, medics and volunteers are involved in the rescue efforts.
Of these, more than eight thousand rescuers are from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
White Helmets in Syria criticize UN for lack of aid
According to estimates by the United Nations (UN), the earthquake left about 5.4 million people homeless.

In Turkey, almost 171,000 tents have been set up in the region affected by the earthquakes.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were delivered to the disaster site.
Meanwhile, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization &quot;White Helmets&quot;, which carries out rescue missions in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a White Helmets representative said that only two small international teams of volunteers, who do not have rescue equipment, had arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN is being received in the region.
Meanwhile, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on events in rebel-held northern Syria, said that a UN aid shipment had arrived in the region the day before, but it lacked shelter tents and rubble-clearing equipment.
About three thousand White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to their data, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people have been found, and more than 3,300 people are considered dead.
More than 10,000 were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
Early in the morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced earthquakes of this magnitude was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
In less than 12 hours, a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook southeastern Turkey, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus holds decisive round of presidential elections - DW - 02/12/2023
The second, decisive round of presidential elections is taking place in the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12.
It included the country&#39;s former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides and the former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Andreas Mavroyiannis.
Conservative politician Christodoulides received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, while his rival in the second round, Mavroyiannis, who is supported by left-wing forces, received 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Union (DISY) party, Averof Neophyta.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, was unable to decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, notes the AFP agency.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the country&#39;s government.
The winner of the current election will serve as head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island occupied by the Turks declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560 thousand people - are participating in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

Energoatom reported a new threat to the Zheleznodorozhny NPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of NNEGC Energoatom Petro Kotin called the Russians&#39; reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
&quot;There are a lot of threats to the ZNPP.
&quot;The decrease in water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a new added threat,&quot; Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level was 13.8 meters, compared to the normal level of 16 meters, &quot;so that the station receives feed for its generators, turbine condensers, and safety systems.&quot;
&quot;In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is rising slightly, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m,&quot; Interfax-Ukraine quotes Kotin.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, began to release less water, while the inflow upstream of the Dnieper increased.
The President of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at the ZaNPP is sufficiently full and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, according to him, &quot;will be a big problem for the ZaNPP.&quot;
Kotin emphasized that the critical level will be 12 meters, and the emergency level will be 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will prevent a critical situation.
Read also: Are mini-power plants able to protect the power system from the consequences of Russian attacks?
As Interfax-Ukraine reminds, the State Nuclear Regulatory Commission, by order dated February 10, 2023, prohibited the operation of power units No. 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Zaporizhzhia NPP at power levels due to the impossibility of eliminating the identified violations of nuclear and radiation safety requirements.

Shelling of territories near the station is also recorded, as a result of which the ZNPP buildings are damaged.
The Russian and Ukrainian sides accuse each other of this, and there is no independent data on who is shelling the ZNPP.
Israel to intensify campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 02/12/2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
&quot;Today the government is meeting to prepare for an even broader counteraction to those who carry out terrorism,&quot; Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
This statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot the man dead at the scene and also arrested and questioned the Palestinian&#39;s family members.
Israeli police sealed the doors and windows of a Palestinian family&#39;s home.
The next step after sealing could be the demolition of the attacker&#39;s house, writes the AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot and killed during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket toward the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said the rocket was intercepted, dpa reports.
Read also: Second attack in two days in Jerusalem: 13-year-old boy injures two people
The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which has led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed in their or their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed in Palestinian attacks in 2023.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people have died in Palestinian attacks on Israelis, writes AR.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 02/12/2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-standing opponents, dpa wrote on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu, held a surprise meeting, at which, as recorded by Greek television cameras, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for Greece being one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to resume dialogue and resolve their problems.
&quot;Greece&#39;s assistance to the Turkish people does not end there,&quot; the Greek Foreign Minister emphasized.
According to him, Athens &quot;will do everything&quot; - bilaterally, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay regions.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the aid provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members had already shown solidarity with each other during the severe earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as &quot;earthquake diplomacy,&quot; helped achieve some de-escalation at the time.
Conflict over islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for decades over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece&#39;s sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece is allegedly violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of every state to self-defense.
Read also: Are Greece and Turkey on the brink of armed conflict?
Turkey reinforces its claims almost daily with fighter jet flights over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country&#39;s leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Ankara&#39;s warming relations with Armenia
Amid the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara opened a crossing closed for over 30 years, through which trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Armenia for victims of the disaster passed.
In addition, Armenia announced the dispatch of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and claimed the lives of more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense for historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany, and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the backdrop of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey&#39;s support for Azerbaijan, the situation only became more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 02/14/2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun in Brussels, which will also include a meeting in the so-called &quot;Ramstein&quot; format on Tuesday, February 14.
On the agenda of the event is further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs &quot;to win this war.&quot;
&quot;We do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks,&quot; Reuters quoted him as saying.
&quot;This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics,&quot; Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine&#39;s need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.
Read also: Head of the Munich Conference opposes &quot;red lines&quot; in aid to Ukraine
During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long-term methodological guidelines for the Alliance&#39;s defense planning.
&quot;Allies will discuss defense investment, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure,&quot; Interfax-Ukraine quoted Stoltenberg as saying.
What to expect from the ninth &quot;Ramstein&quot;
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group meets at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov taking part.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join a special session of the NATO defense ministers&#39; meeting.
&quot;Over 50 countries participating in the Contact Group stand united with you in this fight for Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty and self-defense,&quot; Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide to provide Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that, as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on Russian artists touring in the EU - DW - 02/14/2023
Ukraine is collecting data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded from the Russian state budget in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko in an interview with DW.
Culture as Russia&#39;s weapon
As Grigorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
&quot;Culture is Russia&#39;s strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum says very clearly that the museum&#39;s exhibition projects abroad are their special operation,&quot; says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is currently impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, and musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
For example, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called &quot;DPR&quot; in Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough, and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin&#39;s policies still manage to tour in Europe.
&quot;In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on European sanctions lists,&quot; says Grigorenko and adds: &quot;We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, within the EU.&quot;
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is being addressed by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of Russian cultural and media figures, which contains more than 300 names.

US ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment worth $10 billion
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of military equipment and services worth about $10 billion to Poland.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin, citing the Pentagon&#39;s Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
This primarily concerns launchers of the M142 HIMARS highly mobile artillery rocket system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
&quot;Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,&quot; the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment &quot;to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats.&quot;
In total, Poland has requested the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of HIMARS loading device module;
- 45 M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, personnel training and equipping, systems integration support, engineering, technical and logistical services to the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related logistical and software elements.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also invited missile launchers from South Korea, the publication reports.
NATO Secretary General calls on US to be prepared for Russia&#39;s long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for protection in the war against Russia is not off the agenda, said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
&quot;The first step in securing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or aviators capable of using them.
This is a process that takes some time.
&quot;We have started this process today,&quot; Sunak said of the previously announced program to train Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
&quot;Nothing has been taken off the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of.&quot;
Sunak also announced that previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine &quot;next month&quot; and said that Ukraine &quot;must never again be left vulnerable to attack,&quot; and called for &quot;arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term.&quot;
According to him, the UK has agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10,000 troops in the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, &quot;to accelerate the delivery of our equipment&quot; to ensure Ukraine&#39;s achievements on the front lines in the coming &quot;days and weeks, not years.&quot;
During a press conference, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for Ukraine&#39;s support: &quot;Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
&quot;Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity.&quot;
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call to provide Ukraine with Western fighter jets and added that he &quot;heard from the Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters&quot; to Kyiv.
The Russian Embassy in London has already stated that Britain&#39;s decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have &quot;military-political consequences&quot; for the entire world.
Now, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: &quot;I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion approaches the one-year mark.
I thanked him for the latest decision regarding the tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation.&quot;
Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short window of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of Russia&#39;s expected new offensive in the spring or even February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has already been trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

&quot;Politics and profits&quot; stand in the way of vaccination
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that unless countries effectively use existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be able to end it.
&quot;The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it,&quot; said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
&quot;We have all the necessary tools - effective health care and effective medical tools.
But the world has misused these tools,&quot; Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to achieving the WHO&#39;s goal of vaccinating 40% of each country&#39;s population against the coronavirus are &quot;politics and profits,&quot; the WHO chief said, &quot;not production.&quot;
&quot;Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should cede their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccine Procurement Fund,&quot; Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world.
&quot;And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperating to protect other peoples.&quot;
Together!&quot; Ghebreyesus noted on Twitter.
A WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to &quot;prioritize and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]&quot; and become &quot;much more transparent about what goes where.&quot;
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to &quot;share know-how, technology and licenses and waive intellectual property rights.&quot;
Previously, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the &quot;recipe&quot; for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
&quot;The US administration has trumpeted the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donating vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, that&#39;s not kind-hearted philanthropy; it&#39;s arrogance.
&quot;Poorer countries were not asking for charity in the form of vaccines; they were asking for a fair opportunity from the beginning,&quot; the columnist noted.
&quot;We are not asking for charity,&quot; Tedros said, &quot;we are calling for smart investments in the global recovery.&quot;
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal is intended, according to the US administration, to allow poorer countries to produce drugs that are analogues of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others spoke out against it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine would be a &quot;very serious decision&quot; that would be &quot;not easy to make.&quot;
One of Ukraine&#39;s closest allies stated this in an interview with CNN amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
As CNN&#39;s Laura Kunsberg reports, in an exclusive interview in Warsaw, which will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending the F-16s would create a &quot;serious problem&quot; for Poland because the Polish Air Force has fewer than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves &quot;don&#39;t have enough of them... and we need a lot more.&quot;
Duda also emphasized that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have &quot;a very serious need for maintenance,&quot; so &quot;it is not enough to simply send a few aircraft.&quot;
President Duda&#39;s remarks came amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine, including older Western tanks and anti-missile systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine&#39;s closest allies, and Warsaw has been pushing its NATO allies to send Patriot missiles and Western-made tanks, such as German Leopard tanks, to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine&#39;s Western partners to provide it with the means to combat Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aviation &quot;wings of freedom&quot; for Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was &quot;very grateful&quot; for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on providing Ukraine with aviation would also be successful.
&quot;I have heard from some European leaders about their willingness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
I have a series of bilateral talks right now, we will raise the issue of fighter jets and other aircraft.
&quot;That is why we continue our work here in Brussels,&quot; Zelenskyy said.
As Voice of America reported, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country was ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in &quot;full coordination&quot; with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv&#39;s request for F-16s.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the US, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously, weapons that the US refused to supply eventually ended up in Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.
Ukrainian military begins Leopard 2 training in Germany and Poland
CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the president of Moldova announced a plot by Moscow to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country&#39;s government, place the country &quot;at Russia&#39;s disposal&quot; and thwart its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu&#39;s briefing took place a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country had intercepted Russian intelligence plans to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
&quot;The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to forceful actions, attack some state buildings and even take hostages,&quot; Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
&quot;The goal of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one,&quot; Sandu said, &quot;which would place our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration.&quot;
She promised: &quot;The Kremlin&#39;s attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed.&quot;
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu&#39;s statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received candidate status for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in &quot;several cases of organized criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence.&quot;
Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of challenges over the past year.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; soaring inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed the airspace and debris that was found in its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the Ukraine war entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu stated that Russia wanted to use Moldova in a war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
&quot;I assure you that state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,&quot; Sandu said.
She said that the Moldovan parliament should adopt bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the Prosecutor&#39;s Office, with &quot;the necessary tools to more effectively combat risks to the country&#39;s security.&quot;
The president added that the plan would &quot;rely on several internal forces, but especially criminal groups,&quot; and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile.
Last year, the US and the UK imposed sanctions on both men.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also rocked Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president&#39;s press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security advisor, pro-Western economist Dorin Receanu, as Gavrilita&#39;s successor.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that &quot;Russia has supported campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova for years, often involving the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals.&quot;

Stories from the War: &quot;The Old Woman with the Red Flag&quot; Thrown It Away When She Learned About Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª A living symbol of &quot;pro-Russian Ukraine&quot;, a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, &quot;bravely opposed the nationalists&quot;, is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her with products, but also protect her from the wrath of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she went out with a red flag to what she thought were the Russian military so that they would &quot;not destroy Ukraine.&quot;
And in the aggressor country, her motives were distorted, which is why she now feels like a &quot;traitor.&quot;
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military urges not to disrespect the old woman.
&quot;Now that Anna Ivanovna received a mine in her yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is escaping to Poland, when she found out about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away,&quot; says the platoon commander from the pseudonym &quot;Cadet&quot;
The enemy is creating conditions for an attack on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih ‚Äì summary
The Russian military is conducting combat operations to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for an offensive on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Literally: &quot;To increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
&quot;Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and the Northern Fleet are being transferred by rail to the border areas with Ukraine.&quot;
Details: The enemy did not conduct active operations in the Volyn and Polissya directions.
There have been no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
The threat of the enemy launching missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy carrying out provocations on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine, remains.
We are abandoning Soviet weapons and switching to NATO models ‚Äì Zaluzhny
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny had a telephone conversation with the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Zaluzhny&#39;s direct speech: &quot;We also discussed with my American colleague the promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will finish it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we are ensuring defense, holding occupied lines and positions.&quot;
&quot;Whoever came up with this hellish summer was clearly insane!&quot; complained Wildflower, stretching her arms out in front of her as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
&quot;You say the same thing every time,&quot; Warta observed indifferently, stirring the ice in her cocktail. &quot;In autumn, because it rains and drizzles, the grass rots.&quot;
In winter - because it&#39;s cold and the potion freezes.
In the spring - because it rains again...
&quot;I would sit in my Carpathians,&quot; Varta shrugged indifferently.
Although she didn&#39;t particularly like the city either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and bustle.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quiet, and greener than they had been a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no magic that would allow you to return to the past.
‚Äî Phew!
You say that! ‚Äî Wildflower slapped her palm on the table ‚Äî and the vases with flowers timidly greened. ‚Äî You would sit for a week in the meadow with my grandmother Rutmera with her friends, praying to every passing truck to just take you away from there to some city.
Unless you loved to weed the beds from morning till night, pick herbs, hang them under the ceiling, and sing old hymns at the same time.
Because the dragonfly insisted with her horn that without words, none of my potions would be as they should be.
And wait, I haven&#39;t even mentioned picking up all the trash at night!
But where is it, our white-handed one, you would have died, not even a week would have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a &quot;beautiful&quot; life, and that they like such a &quot;job&quot;, that it is their conscious choice and the like.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Currently, the problem of Ukrainian women being drawn into prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea to legalize prostitution... which made me not feel very good about him.
I think we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of &quot;Swedish model&quot;.
In this case, it is not the woman who is being ordered, but the client.
They help women get out of this &quot;business,&quot; but not make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also think about what they are buying - &quot;pleasure&quot; or violence...
There is a need for something else... can you show me where the nearest optician with a doctor can write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy frames, high-quality ones... I looked at some frames sites and was pleasantly surprised - they are cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frame was average (or even lower).
I don&#39;t know what frames are available in stores, but the prices in online stores are pretty reasonable.
But when it comes to some cosmetics, I can definitely say that they are more expensive here.
Much more.
Multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive in our country (this is when compared to our average salaries).
Considering our family&#39;s budget (especially the fact that we have to rent an apartment), $300 for glasses is a pretty high amount.
Have your doctors offered you an artificial multifocal lens?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I developed intolerance to the lenses, and a year after that I wore hard lenses, and I developed a severe allergy to almost all cosmetics.
I have been wearing glasses constantly for 4 years now, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that Covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years of age, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was over $1,000, which is very, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he doesn&#39;t wear lenses or get laser correction, and he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1,500 UAH, this amount is unrealistic.
My glasses now mask my wrinkles.
Yes.
My mother has little work experience.
She didn&#39;t work much: first she had small children who were often sick, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3,800 hryvnias and has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8,000 hryvnias and all of this money had to be paid for rent.
In good times (before Covid), there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
That&#39;s why many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their families or buy a house, but then they lose touch with their families...
Yes, there are advantages.
But when my husband has a day off, he goes to the apiary)
Good night
According to the order, from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, and Kherson are closed until control over the specified seaports is restored.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to provide service to vessels and passengers, ensure the proper level of navigation safety and environmental protection during the conduct of military operations by Russia in these regions, which pose a threat to the life and health of people.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
As an Ukrinform correspondent reports, Reuters reports this, citing a statement from the British Foreign Ministry.
‚ÄúThe British Foreign Office said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the United Kingdom and South Africa,‚Äù the material says.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached these conclusions based on expert research.
‚ÄúThe department said that this study exposed exactly how the Kremlin&#39;s disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers,‚Äù Reuters writes.
According to the study, the troll factory ‚Äúused Telegram to recruit and coordinate new supporters, who then acted against Kremlin critics, bombarding them with comments supporting President Putin and his war.‚Äù
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
&quot;Traces of the operation were detected in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok,&quot; the report says.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in this regard that her government has already ‚Äúwarned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin‚Äôs illegal war,‚Äù Tras concluded.
Ivanna, I will explain to you now.
Your hair structure is such that all of your hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either thin out your hair.
But this will greatly affect the thickness of the hair.
That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t do it.
Or dye your roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I didn&#39;t dye my roots either.
Therefore, the transition can be a bit abrupt.
I can melt the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to match your color, so when your hair grows back you won&#39;t notice the difference.
Regarding hair quality.
Unfortunately, any bleaching affects the quality of the hair.
Hair may become drier, this is normal because it is blonde.
It is impossible to make such a blonde without losing quality.
If you take proper care of your hair, its condition will return to normal.
Please write what Matrix care product you use.
Maybe he&#39;s too weak for a blonde.
We can sign up for a free tint to make the transition smoother.
There is also a rather sharp transition in this photo.
Because a large percentage of blonde is in the root zone.
Please write when you can come over so I can take a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
There are a lot of positives from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I strive for it.
Even if it&#39;s in this way, it&#39;s helping people who almost no one in the world helps or says &quot;good morning&quot; with a smile from the heart.
I found some great basic Czech language lessons on the internet today.
I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep in the morning, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
From the side, I&#39;m talking to myself, but it&#39;s good that no one sees or hears me at this time üòÖ I think I can learn the language this way for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this job is learning the language through headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, who had a significant influence on the formation of the cultural background of the Russians.
The cult of conquest and raids has been successful throughout Russia&#39;s history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of Putin&#39;s regime.
These cultural characteristics have shaped state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of aggressive wars because they believe their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
Russians have not yet felt the full effects of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand stronger sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
Russian military forces are shelling and seizing nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also spotted over the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant in the Mykolaiv region.
With its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
A missile strike, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to power and water supply failures could lead to radiation leaks.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the &quot;red button&quot; to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine ‚Äì the Russian threat can only be defeated together!
The Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery, and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases have been recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory have decided to ‚Äúexpropriate last year‚Äôs and this year‚Äôs crop surpluses‚Äù from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take away the farmers&#39; sowing material, but at the same time demand that they successfully carry out the sowing in order to then send new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens with physical violence.
Russia is repeating the USSR&#39;s policy of mass plundering of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor of 1932-33, and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a &quot;liberation war against the Nazis,&quot; Russia is, in particular, provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country abandon any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
They force their mothers to scout out the locations of Ukrainian soldiers, and if they refuse, they threaten to kill their children.
People are being pushed to make a tough choice: lose their children or become traitors to their homeland and suffer punishment for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine, Lyudmila Denisova, has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation &quot;to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas.&quot;
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don&#39;t like their indecision.
Thousands are dying because NATO does not close the skies over Ukraine.
More than 50,000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons we would be powerless, but I must say that they come in insufficient quantities and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think this is also beneficial for the alliance itself, because with NATO weapons and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe.
Did you know that a Ukrainian invented how to reload the &quot;disposable&quot; NLAW anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage.
Russians deserve the worst and most horrible things imaginable.
So to some extent I&#39;m happy with what&#39;s happening.
Because this war hasn&#39;t been going on for 4 months, it started around the 15th century, I can&#39;t remember exactly now.
But for all these hundreds of years, there has been an attempt to make us their slaves.
No sooner does one generation die than another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have come back to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
It&#39;s really strange for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the speed of events, I didn&#39;t even have time to comprehend or reflect on the very fact that there was a war going on and what it meant to me.
It&#39;s great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work. I won&#39;t be able to live on the support of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband doesn&#39;t want me to have constant quarrels at work. And I will have to return to Ukraine, but we could stay, but he will do everything to make sure we go back. It&#39;s a very difficult situation.
He doesn&#39;t want us to live here, that&#39;s his answer.
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but so that we stay at home all the time, I took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war, but he says that we will go home immediately, he will not do any documents for us
I probably won&#39;t be able to leave on my own if he has a long case, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic.
Long beating
I want to study to be a hairdresser when the war is over and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic. If he doesn&#39;t want to, then we will probably have to go to a lawyer. It&#39;s too early to do anything now. But here he clearly told us that after the war we would go home immediately.
We&#39;ll go home, but I already know that he won&#39;t take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said he would take us))) well now I know the truth
Yes, thank you. We will find a way out of the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!!! Everything will be fine!!!
No, he doesn&#39;t have anyone at the moment, that&#39;s for sure. I think the reason is that children in the Czech Republic want a lot of things, they ask him for toys, to go to McDonald&#39;s, they scream, they run all over the house. But he is used to peace, that no one bothers him and he doesn&#39;t ask for anything less. But here we came and everything annoys him and we have to spend money on him, and he is very economical. So he would rather we live in Ukraine.
Outside the train window, birch and fir trees, dusted with fine gray rain, were fluttering, sprinkled with black and white confetti by magpies, mournful water trucks and freighters.
Comrade Operations Officer Orlrv lay on a narrow, Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow, Spartan bed he had at home.
He unfolded a simple business trip kit ‚Äì rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and he was unpretentious in life; he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old rusty suitcase and carefully took out with both hands the crystal dome that sparkled dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you, comrade?‚Äù the young cadet, his neighbor, asked in fear.
&quot;A rarity,&quot; said Comrade Orlov with a tenderness unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, &quot;such a thing, you see... A very interesting and exciting thing.&quot;
This, you could say, is my friend...
Yes, I look at work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find jobs for men, for special education.
I don&#39;t know Czech, I&#39;m a teacher of young children, I&#39;m not an engineer, and I don&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license.
And also the big question is finding housing.
This is my first time abroad and I just don&#39;t know what to do or how to act.
I haven&#39;t been able to find a job for a month, I&#39;ve only cleaned in one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I&#39;m not even going there.
I have problems everywhere here üò≠ it&#39;s my first time abroad, I don&#39;t know the language and I&#39;m all alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can&#39;t find a job anymore.
I ask people, look at websites - nothing
I am attending a course in this village.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, the situation now is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it lasts.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don&#39;t see any other options ((
I don&#39;t want to just sit around because housing won&#39;t be free for long.
I understand.
I don&#39;t want to take money from you.
I don&#39;t want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in in a regular city, not in the capital.
The difficult three-day journey from Ukraine and a big city with a foreign language really scared me.
I didn&#39;t come here to visit cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of the children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have training in sewing on a sewing machine.
I made custom bed linens and some clothes.
Maybe there will be such a job.
I can do it!

Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of whether or not to exclude the Association of Russian Psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia&#39;s attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
I will give an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, most likely the adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after a while the game will continue.
If one child in the sandbox starts hitting another child in the face with a shovel, that child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian psychologist colleague about the fact that when someone from the next apartment kills someone, they don&#39;t put the entire apartment building in jail.
There are many discussions among Ukrainian psychologists on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones. Many feel so much pain that they cannot bear communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to collaborate with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to treat the trauma of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who, at their level, are trying to do many things to develop universal human values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia, 5-10% of the population supports the war, and the other numbers in opinion polls are painted over by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
My wife had a good job and, no matter the war, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on my wife&#39;s neck in the Czech Republic, I am trying to earn money, because in 2009 I received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, everyone also earns money in whatever way they can.
Now the only problem is learning the Czech language.
The wife teaches languages and works and earns money for herself and the child to eat, go to kindergarten, pay for a bus ticket, pay for mobile phone services, and pay for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my Motherland.
Thank you for the support of people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine during this difficult time. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife&#39;s massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she doesn&#39;t want to live off the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you
Thank you very much.
This really helps my wife earn money for her family.
Okay, I&#39;ll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife&#39;s announcement, but my wife is offering her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It&#39;s good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not expect help from your republic.
WARNING!!!
AUCTION ANNOUNCED!!!
Good evening my brothers and sisters)

I really need someone who could act as a translator for a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, while we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we&#39;re dealing with the insurance company to get the car fixed.
The insurance company invited a person who can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the technical inspection of the car.
Please tell me if you can help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on a statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience working in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to read scientific papers about tardigrades, observe their life activities under a microscope, and talk to scientists who study them.
So the option of studying these and other microscopic organisms in more depth also interests me.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - analysis from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee aid from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at meetings between the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the task of solving many problems.
It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing, and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500,000 arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors ‚Äì Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äì and will be tirelessly grateful!
How Poland is experiencing the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden, the ProUkrainian editorial office asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this had a significant impact on the lives of Czechs.
There are long queues in the labor governments, significant price increases in the stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began providing assistance when hostilities began.
This was foreseen.
In Poland, they have been saying for the past few months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what was to happen, while in Poland, there was active preparation.
For example, in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans for where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.
In Ukraine, they didn&#39;t even think that something like this could happen.
I heard people smiling about Poland&#39;s fear of refugees.
But it was very deliberate: to prepare for all these events even before the war began.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombings and the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance with logistics - moving around Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that travel within Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had experience working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, not a city of a million, as some might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, travel fees for Ukrainians have been canceled.
They can travel for free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland has reached an agreement with German carriers, which have organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
Mostly these are small indoor school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are set up.
Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there, they are looking for opportunities to move to more comfortable conditions.
The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian neighborhoods have now been created.
The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they managed to get the Russian embassy to take back the facilities that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood in a neglected state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in.
The Polish local government nationalized it, so to speak.
It was taken for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, and they will be insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine could already be living there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted, and the Senate approved, a law on refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally reside in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all European Union countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS and receive a code on your phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicine for free in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which is provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various foundations are common, including Caritas and the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, and clothing.
As the Poles say: &quot;Niespotykana skala&quot;.
That is, &quot;an event that has no analogues.&quot;
Such a huge openness.
This is a huge expense for the Polish state.
The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.
In fact, this is an extremely large blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
The questions start with clinics, where Ukrainians cannot manage without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems and illnesses.
The second problem is schools where students, especially in the upper grades, also struggle at first and cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often arrive with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have good English skills, but their overall level is higher than the grade they are in.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are valued so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, it is much more difficult for an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine to master this job here.
As a lawyer or an accountant, I don&#39;t know of any such cases.
Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
The language barrier is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of being here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.
They did not settle here, they did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and accordingly they would be more comfortable returning home.
This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, significant changes have occurred.
If previously Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively as labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of Russia&#39;s attack on Georgia took place, he was in Tbilisi, along with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will definitely not stop at Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.
Then there could be the Baltic countries, and it could even reach Poland.
That is, as if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, and their heroic deeds.
Poland and Poles appreciate this, which is why they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
They see a threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war could also knock on our door.
That&#39;s why the attitude changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem are now in Poland not a ‚Äúsong of nationalists‚Äù or some enemies.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly claim that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is simply perceived with laughter in Poland, because these so-called ‚Äúnationalists‚Äù turned out to be completely different people, they have no political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When Poles start to think that there might be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as is happening now in Ukraine.
People here are constantly talking about people from Mariupol, Bucha, and other Ukrainian cities.
How Poland perceives Russian threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst-case scenario, because a terrible war is ongoing.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.
Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How are the authorities and society in Poland reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the US and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, additional recruitment into the territorial defense forces is underway in Poland.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is noticeable to citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among these is the recently adopted new law on homeland defense, which significantly increased the budget for Poland&#39;s military needs.
The requirements for military recruitment have been changed, many aspects that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions became reality in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.
What do you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don&#39;t really believe it.
But such a scenario exists.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, in the territory of the Volyn region.
I&#39;ll note, I wouldn&#39;t want this, but it&#39;s the worst-case scenario.
A low-power blow, but so that all television channels show this &quot;fungus&quot;.
So that it can be seen from Poland and the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be a flight and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin&#39;s entourage, the oligarchs, who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the fire at the hydroelectric power plant on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are starting to be outraged by the prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies towards peaceful settlement of the war.
Various European Union countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
At most, this will drag on until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible cessation of gas supplies.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I&#39;m an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
Regarding oil, we have the striking fact that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very sensitive topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe were to abandon Russian energy resources, it would mean the loss of a source of funding for Russia&#39;s military.
Even a schoolchild understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased significantly.
And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a war zone.
That is, the president&#39;s actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government representatives as very active.
They indicate that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused on obtaining military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discusses these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity, which sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
You don&#39;t hear that here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, and ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there is no loss of image.
In fact, Ukraine&#39;s image is holding up, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I am very uncomfortable and embarrassed to complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law&#39;s friend, who helped find this apartment, also joined the conflict.
She said that she wasn&#39;t looking for it for us, and if something doesn&#39;t suit us, we should leave and she would make sure that the mother-in-law, not us, stayed to live here.
Unfortunately, none of them think about the child, who is used to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months he has already changed 6 homes.
I&#39;m very sorry, I couldn&#39;t have imagined that such a situation would happen.
Sorry again for bothering you.
And regarding the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that the bed was not needed.
He came here to see me and the child and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she didn&#39;t care about his opinion and wishes.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka, and Yan, the landlady.
You tried so hard for us.
Understood.
I thought it would continue for a long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andriy&#39;s treatment, to do this at least by the end of the summer?
Maybe we need a certificate for Andriy that he is sick.
In Ukraine, such a diagnosis would be considered a disability.
And since Inna doesn&#39;t go to kindergarten yet, I also don&#39;t have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home.
I understand, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andriy.
I&#39;m worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Can you give me some advice?
I also wanted to ask, did you receive money for the medicine you bought for Andriy?
The handle mount falls out.
It&#39;s short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 servings were sold today.
The apricot is over.
I poured mango.
Mango is not doing very well.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla because they don&#39;t like mango.
Norm, the mango is gone.
But it started to creak againüò≠
They started actively taking ice cream and it&#39;s not workingüò≠

He freezes again, creaks.
Hadness at 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it, he doesn&#39;t let them have ice cream at all.
üò≠
It&#39;s just that the line for ice cream starts to grow, it starts to give off such nuances and people move on.
It freezes.
If there is no ice cream, it will creak and the piston will rub.
And you can&#39;t put vanilla in mango.
Can Magdalena come tomorrow at 8:00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is gone, and tomorrow it will be a different flavor.
Will you be home this evening so we can settle the bill for last month?
I would be very grateful if you could come on Sunday or Saturday.

When we started learning Czech and met a lot of interesting people

Currently, she and her family live in the Czech Republic in the city of Liberec.
Maria has 12 years of teaching experience and holds a PhD in Pedagogical Sciences.
She loves physics very much because since childhood she dreamed of being a teacher of this particular subject.
Maria studied in art class during her school years, so she knows how to draw and, most importantly, loves to draw.
At the age of 12, Marichka became interested in playing the bandura and graduated from music school.
Maria is now 38 years old. She is a good mother and a good example for her two sons and one daughter.
The dream was almost fulfilled, but unfortunately the war changed all plans. But I believe that in the future this dream will still come true.
people wanted to leave the Soviet Union and left
Maidan is a place where people protest.
Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text Independent Ukraine in 1990
He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine.
Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and still couldn&#39;t really understand whether they liked being an independent country or whether they wanted to be an autonomous republic of Russia.
When Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv, but still in the Soviet Union there was the city of Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934.
I can&#39;t say that there were any other interesting events, but if there was democracy at first, it would have been much better and we would probably be in the European Union now.
Good afternoon, can I come to clean today?
Can you tell me the Wi-Fi password?
