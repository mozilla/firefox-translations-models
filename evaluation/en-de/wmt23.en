Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool. The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley. The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire. The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder." Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."
The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media. George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community. "The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety," he said. "Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community." The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.
More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum. The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations. The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to "stop the boats" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda. Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
Derry midfielder Adam Reilly closes down Lee Grace at the Brandywell
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
The Hoops went on to win the Premier Division by 13 points but Duffy soon had City further ahead with a long-range effort which managed to squirm under keeper Leon Pohls and into the net. Last season's runners-up were two goals to good at the break. Graham Burke went closest to reducing the arrears in the second period but the Candystripes were comfortable winners a week prior to their quest for national glory. City boss Ruaidhri Higgins praised his team after what he said was the "hardest week of my life" following the death of his brother Kevin. "It's a kick in the teeth and there's tough weeks ahead but we'll get on with it in his memory," said Higgins. "To beat Shamrock Rovers and deservedly so with a good performance is really pleasing."
DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings
The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border. "The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday. "DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS." A DHS official tells CBS News the department has hired the firm for contracted work for the life of the congressional inquiry. Debevoise was chosen because of its expertise in impeachment and bipartisan experience in working with Congress on oversight.
The Justice Department recently advised that the contract with Debevoise qualifies as an appropriate expenditure for DHS. DHS is trying to ensure that its mission isn't undermined by partisan attacks and that proceedings against Mayorkas are being handled by people with the appropriate expertise. Mayorkas has not commented on this development, but asked about the impeachment inquiry last Thursday, he told reporters, "We will cooperate with this Congress, just as we did with the last Congress. I think that's our responsibility." He conceded that "it will take time" to comply with the House's investigation. "I will spend that time as will others and we will also not compromise the time that we spend in fulfilling our mission." A DHS senior official confirmed that Mayorkas has not yet met with his new outside counsel. Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap. In 1876, Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, was accused of accepting bribes but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.
Four teens charged in attack of 14-year-old who died of suicide after beating video was posted online
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school
Four New Jersey teenagers have been charged in connection with the attack of a 14-year-old girl who later took her own life after video of the incident was posted on social media. One juvenile is charged with aggravated assault, two juveniles are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one juvenile is charged with harassment, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer told CBS News in an email.
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her Bayville home on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teen, then kicking and dragging her down school hallways. They pushed Adriana into red lockers lining the school hallways and one of the girls in a pink shirt punched Kuch repeatedly.
Another girl outside of the video frame laughed as she recorded the scene. Two adults came in to break up the attack, with one adult pulling the teens apart. Adriana lay hurt and bruised on the hallway floor as the adult tried to help her up.
One of the girls said, "That's what you get." "She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter.
Kuch said police should have been called immediately because the students, who he said his daughter had been having problems with, smashed her face with a 20-ounce bottle. "If they called the police and did an investigation, those girls would not have posted videos from school," Kuch said. He also said his daughter, who had bruises on her body, should've been taken to the hospital. "We always address every issue of bullying and on the day of the incident four students were suspended," Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides, superintendent of schools, told CBS New York.
School officials told CBS New York that they notified the family and called Adriana's death horrible. Each teenager and their guardian was served with a copy of their complaint and were released pending future court appearances, the prosecutor told CBS News. Students at the school staged a walkout Wednesday in support of Adriana's family.

I talked to 30 health, wellness professionals about avoiding burnout
In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout.
Here are the top four approaches that they use.
1.Build a strong community: As someone who works with patients who have terminal illnesses, Eufrosina Young thanks her strong support system for her ability to maintain her energy. Young is a board-certified neurologist and ALS specialist at the Upstate University Hospital's department of neurology, and says they "mobilize like an army of people" there. There isn't a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but knowing that she isn't the only one putting in the hard work to develop treatments and provide better options for her patients, keeps Young going even on her hardest days. "We're not carrying the weight of the world, but being part of a world of people that are advocating for this work," she says.
2.Rest when you need to: Working two jobs as a sleep researcher and an algorithm engineer, all while taking care of a new baby, would have definitely led Raphael Vallat to burnout if he didn't rest, he says. "I feel like when I'm about to burn out, basically every task feels like a mountain that you need to climb, and feels super urgent and important," says Vallat. In those moments, "you really need to take some time off and realize that these tasks can wait." Typically, Vallat finds moments in his day where he can pause and spend time in nature to ground himself before returning to work.
3.Be passionate about what you're doing and remember your purpose: Up until spring of 2022, infectious disease specialist Céline Gounder worked 100 hours a week for seven days a week. Being on the frontlines during the pandemic ate up almost all of her time, but she avoided burnout by reminding herself about why her work is important. "I don't think work feels like work when you feel like you're having an impact," says Gounder. "If you're working crazy hours doing something that has no meaning to you, I think you really do need to step back and question what you're doing."
4.Have other joys: Across the board, each of the experts said they engage in some hobby like exercise, dancing and even playing the guitar. It's extremely important to have a life you enjoy that exceeds what you accomplish in your job, says Christina Maslach, social psychologist, retired professor of psychology at U.C. Berkeley and author of "The Burnout Challenge: Managing People's Relationships with Their Jobs." "Look at your life as a whole, and make sure there's good things about it, and make sure you have time for them."
Juvenile charged with murder in December Chicago school shooting that left 2 dead
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
Four teenagers were shot December 16 at Benito Juarez High School. The victims who died were both boys, aged 14 and 15, police announced at the time. Investigators say tips from the public helped lead them to the suspect, who was arrested Thursday. "We are grateful for those who have been brave enough to come forward to ensure that the offender is caught and will now be held accountable," said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. The suspect is expected to appear in Bond Court Saturday, Brown said, where more details about the evidence they have collected will be presented.
Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department. Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post. The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals. If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant. In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food. But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, "because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite." Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources. The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat.
Photos: Following restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuty and Hery tombs
The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden.
Important tombs from an important era
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty. These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.
Djehuty was also responsible for recording Hatshepsut's journey to Puntland, and providing electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) for covering the top of the obelisks that she placed in the Karnak temples. In addition, he was in charge of the process of moving the obelisks. The room that precedes the Djehuty's burial chamber features inscriptions engraved with 43 chapters of the Book of the Dead, the first time that the chapters of the book were written on the walls of tombs before being written on linen and papyrus. Hery, held the position of superintendent of the royal stores of the sacred royal wife and mother, Ahhotep.
Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said. Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: "Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north." They added: "This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government." Reeves said: "I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."
O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse. Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017"s snap general election. Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: "I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user. But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case. He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP. He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."
The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates. But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect." She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."
Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network. After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices.
Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach "wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining." Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers. "We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers. We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed. And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them. Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future," said Reeves.
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted. The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said.
The Tate was hosting Drag Queen Story Hour UK on Saturday, with tales told by Aida H Dee, who the gallery's website describes as "the first drag artist in Europe to read stories to children in a nursery." A rightwing group of protesters demonstrated outside the gallery and were met by counterprotesters led by trans-rights campaigners and political groups, including Stand Up to Racism. Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.
Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been "proper emotional," adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and "caused a disruption" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings. She had previously told Pink News that the invite to the Tate for the event during LGBTQ+ history month had been "an honour." Her readings have previously been targeted by protesters. The Drag Queen had said that "risk assessments" had taken place beforehand - but added it was "ridiculous" that they were necessary. Aida tweeted: "5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!" Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm. A spokesperson for the Tate said: "We do not programme artists in order to promote particular points of view, nor to reconcile differing points of view." Our galleries offer a broad programme and visitors have the freedom to choose which aspects of it they engage with."
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage. Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city. Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie.
Another nearby skyscraper on Pine Street in Lower Manhattan became the tallest building after the destruction of the Twin Towers. High-rise office leasing in Manhattan has been dropping for years, which was exacerbated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies shut down and employees of surviving firms worked remotely. Wells Fargo, which is servicing the mortgage on 40 Wall Street, "has reached out to the borrower for a status of leasing developments" and the plans to improve the property's performance, according to the filing, Bloomberg reported.
Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed "Putin's chef" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled. The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance. As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.
On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure. High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas. Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was "difficult but controllable," adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas. Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday. The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening. Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region. The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast. The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified. The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday. The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.

ASTANA.KAZINFORM - Opening ceremony of the 10th Asian Athletics Indoor Championships took place on Friday at Qazaqstan sports center in Astana. Attending the event was Kazakh Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov, Kazinform cites the press service of the Kazakh Prime Minister. Opening the event, the Head of the Kazakh government read out the welcome letter of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. "Sport knows no bounds. It strengthens friendship and brings together nations and countries. Special attention is attached to sports in Kazakhstan. There are all conditions for doing professional and mass sports in our country.
Great attention is placed on the development of sports infrastructure. Clear evidence of that is this athletics complex seating over six thousand people," reads the Kazakh President's letter. Kazakhstani athletes successfully compete and represent Kazakhstan at major world competitions. They are an example to the growing generation and inspire the youth for great victories, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that the holding of the Asian Championships in Astana will give a new impetus to the development of athletics in the country, pledging for greater cooperation with international organizations in the sphere.
Kazakh Prime minister Smailov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his assistance in preparing for and holding the championships. The Asian Athletics Indoor Championships take place for the first time in the CIS territory. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who are to compete in race, relay race, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and all-around event. The tournament is to run through February 12. Earlier it was reported Kazakhstani runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won the women's 3,000m gold, and Olga Safronova claimed the women's 60m silver at the tournament.
Yellowstone' actor Q'orianka Kilcher beats fraud charges
Attorney Camille Vasquez, who represented Johnny Depp in last year's blockbuster defamation trial, has scored another legal victory - this time with "Yellowstone" actor Q'orianka Kilcher. On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers" compensation fraud case. In a statement shared Friday with The Times, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney said the court "determined that Ms. Kilcher did not commit insurance fraud and advised the court that we were unable to proceed."
In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two felony counts of workers" compensation fraud, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The time frame also includes several months when Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite the actor's claims that she was too injured to work. Kilcher self-surrendered and was arraigned in May.
"Today, I am beyond grateful that my case has been dismissed - tomorrow my journey begins to help raise awareness and demand more transparency for worker's rights within the workers comp system" Kilcher said Friday in a statement shared with The Times. She added that she "look[s] forward to shedding more light on this experience and continuing to do the work I love." Kilcher also thanked Vasquez and her fellow Brown Rudnick attorney Steve Cook for "their steadfast belief in my innocence."
According to TMZ, Kilcher hired the two in September. Kilcher broke out with Terrence Malick's 2002 movie "The New World," where she portrayed Pocahontas. Her credits also include "Sons of Anarchy," "The Alienist" and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold." She most recently appeared in the road-trip film "Dog," starring Channing Tatum.
Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns. Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday. "I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility," he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December.
In November, the brand shared photos for its "The Gift" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire. Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving "virtual child pornography" in the background. Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its "disturbing images" on social media. Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar "mistakes" in the future. "This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward," Demna told Vogue.
He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: "restructuring the image department," conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help "thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health." "It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it," he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday.
Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta. Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children. In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's "provocative" ways. "This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image," he said. "I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."
Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most "painful" parts of the backlash was tarnishing "the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga." "Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all," Demna said. "We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."
It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc. In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023. Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians. He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, "we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank." Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended). "We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira. "The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country," he added.
On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system. "The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank," he stated.
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)
Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's "absolutely disgusting" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City. Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million. The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.
But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League. The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts. "I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties," Sherwood told Soccer Saturday. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable. His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side. Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition. Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing." While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time. Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.
Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe? The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail. First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.
The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting. But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim. So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed. Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence.
The court observed in 1974"s United States v. Nixon: ... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial. Therefore, precedent is on the government's side. Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump. But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.
As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, "probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources." That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight. And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail. That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6. It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize. So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege.
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak
Why is this important? While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example. Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans" weird Goofus impulses. But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.
Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership. Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so. There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director. It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: "We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness: This is the best way to earn the press's trust. They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP. We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth. This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical. Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Some Super Bowl Commercials I Can't Wait to See
A nineties sitcom star reprising his beloved role to sell you car insurance. An ad that becomes a cultural phenomenon and gets immediately green-lighted as a TV show, extending a twelve-second scene into ten seasons. All the celebrities from last year's crypto ads apologizing for their crypto ads. Those "whassup" guys but the bit is that now they're old. Everybody's into whodunnits now, right? So some series of ads directed by Rian Johnson where if you figure out who did the murder you get a discount on a year of car insurance. A commercial that all of the super-online conservative guys are going to be furious about for a week.
Timothée Chalamet in some capacity. Somebody who was supposedly cancelled forever making his triumphant return to television to sell you beer. An ad for the worst movie you'll ever see that you'll definitely watch when it's streaming in three weeks. An excruciatingly catchy new jingle that you'll be singing to yourself for years. A recycled Twitter joke from two months ago. A musician whose whole thing is being counterculture who is counterculturally telling you to bank with Wells Fargo. The "zoom zoom" kid but the bit is that now he's an adult.
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice "doesn't want an armed citizenry" in the first place. Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule. His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones. Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature. He said, "The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States." Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms. He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry." He added, "But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."
Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail. He said he has "three tools" with which to fight the rule. The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.
On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to "reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces." He also noted that he would "introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach." Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule. But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.
He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass. However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule. He said: "I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, "No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule." And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August. I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.
We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'
On Friday's edition of NBC's "MTP Now," Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has "a lot of concern" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that "If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet." And said that "we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."
Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue "came up." We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it. And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan. We hope they do. If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet. But we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us. We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration.
McDonald's withdraws "tasteless" advert near crematorium - RT World News
McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's "McCrispy" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side. The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall. It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services. The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as "tasteless" by some angry locals. "Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one," said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media.
However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by "how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie." One person said they "fell off the chair laughing" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was "no worse" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built "next door to a retirement village."
A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible. "We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed," the fast-food brand said. Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media.
Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river
Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his "gut instinct" is that she is not in the river. Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an "open mind" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in. Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed.
Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school. The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call. Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep "all options open" about her disappearance, but his "gut instinct" tells him she is not in the river. He described Ms Bulley as "fun," "loving," "the most loyal friend you could ever have" and an "exceptional mum" who "absolutely adores our girls." "She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine," he told 5 News.
Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through "unprecedented hell," hope that his partner will be found is "stronger than ever." Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry. On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area.
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95
BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died. He was 95. Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.
Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy." During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure. But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own. The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest. Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification.
In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual "united fatherland" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin. Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support. The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.
Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament. Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.
In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden. It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine. Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans. His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.
Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group. "Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values. The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its "Cow Hug Day" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users. The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been "absolutely crazy, defying logic." He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more "to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters." The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it "stands withdrawn." It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that "hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."
It added that the cow is the "backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother." There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off. Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to "blindly" following Western values.
Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties. Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as "koe knuffelen." Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or "mother cow" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter.
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.
Pedestrian dies in hospital after crash with car in Cowdenbeath as man arrested
A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm. A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash. Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch." I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us. "Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live
Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries. When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third. In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB). After that, citizens from the EU, EEA and the UK made up the second largest group, accounting for not far off 10 percent of the city's population.
Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents. From here, the size of the groups drops significantly. For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America. Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
Alna, in the northeast of the city, was the borough with the most foreign residents. Some 18,257 foreign residents were registered as living there in 2022. Afterwards, trendy Grünerløkka, located reasonably centrally, had the second highest number of foreign residents, with 17,631. Gamle Oslo also had a significant immigrant population, with 17,631 people living there after moving from another country.
Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.
At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough. Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents. However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen. Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
Gamle Oslo and Alna were the two parts of the city where the largest number of immigrants from Africa lived, along with Stovner, Grünerløkka and Søndre Norstrand. Those from North America were spread fairly evenly across Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, Vestre Aker and Nordre Aker. Citizens from South and Central America were most commonly found in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo St.Hanshaugen and Sagene. Europeans from outside the EU, EEA and UK tended to live in the town's most central borough, Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker and Stovner. And finally, of the several hundred nationals from Oceania, Frogner, Grünerløkka and Gamle Oslo were the boroughs with the highest populations of these nationals.
Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months. The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts. The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline.
Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days. "We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW," Mudyiwa told Reuters. "But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit," she said. Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity. The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects. Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.
The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.
Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.
To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end. But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.
So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.
Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support. Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments. The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered. Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts. It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.
Going to be my first project car.
Picking this up this weekend. I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic. Already on coil overs and lowered ride height. I've done a little research but I would love if anyone has any info about this car. Personal experiences? I know they're not fast compared
#Venting into the Fediverse time. The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub. When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman. Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as "making me look like a neo-nazi". Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff. And said thank you. And I said her nails looked cool. The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell. If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison. It takes the state's governor. The two states involved are New York and Georgia. The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis. NY is the best hope for accountability
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning. In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario. In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence. At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings. We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end. Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication. We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts. The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.
Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming. Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.
I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects. When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support. Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
Nicholas is working with farmers to reduce pesticide use while finding ways to address the issues caused by climate change and pests such as fall armyworm, which can devastate maize crops.

I have to email some random address, with unformatted data, so the clerk can read the email and enter it into their system to print a label.
And they always to charge me $2.25 for that "convenience".
The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night. It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media. THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE. Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience! Who vetted & chose the individuals? There's a story to be reported there. The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all. It can't be repeated.
I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge. There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather.
Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean. I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them. It worked.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business. They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Sure they cut business taxes. But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it.
Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads. I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said "long journey!"
"Yeah and I'm coming back today," I said. "I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow," I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion.
"There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' " the ticket guy said.
It's a thing I've never said before either.
The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism. Trumpism is a cult. It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it. And they are truly nuts. We can not allow them to hijack our country. It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now. Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over. Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal. This is not OK...
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street. So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat. I swear covid-infected people are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
It is not socially acceptable to go out in public or rush up to people when you are coughing up a mucus storm. I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!
Writing Wonders 5/11: Does your MC laugh or cry more?
Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you see she's hurt and laughs most when things are upside-down. Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.
After 4,000 of distress Yl finds herself in a place of love and is having huge feels she doesn't know what to do with so there's a lot of both.
#CNN needs to just close down. Yesterday's fiasco with #MangoMoron was an outrageous fiasco. Who at that pathetic, dying network was responsible for vetting the so-called "independent voters" in the audience? Which cable news "executive" made the call to give the fat, lying criminal this much air-time?
High pressure will prevail through early next week. A cold front should arrive by the middle of next week.

One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
Forget me, fine. Ignore me, fine. It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse. That takes effort. Slamming a door in my face takes effort. Our dogs used to be BEST FRIENDS.
And I still have NO IDEA what I could have possibly done to deserve this.
They had keys to my apartment for 6+ years.
That vessel is off-limits. I am aware of your hatred of Organa. She is irrelevant to me. You may kill her if you can. But another individual often flies aboard that ship. If he were to die... the consequences would be... significant.
I gripe about dad-ification a lot. Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:
It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification. Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as "caring."
Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.
Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.
In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.

- We send out notifications when airfare goes on sale. - We provide links to where you can book the fare. - We don't sell tickets, or charge a subscription. - More details are in the full blog post. - We maintain a list of example booking dates for each deal we post and we update that list several times a day.
Ukrainian children have a right to grow up in a peaceful and secure environment.
Yet, unimaginable fear, terror and displacement have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
This Tuesday, President von der Leyen met First Lady Olena Zelenska in Kyiv to discuss how to support her efforts to provide mental health assistance to vulnerable children.
We have already offered mental health and psychosocial support.
All our efforts will help them make it through this journey.
A bunch of shiny new goodness in #dart
Over time dart became my go-to for quick UI. #flutter is a pleasure to work with, and they have #mobx for easy store management. The dependency story is less insane than nodejs, too.
Of course flutter sucks really bad when it comes to behaving like a good native app would (anywhere, really. Even flutter web target sucks). But it allows to move fast and that's why it's ideal for small hacks.
Echidna with amethyst and magenta spikes. They are average height, has an average build and muscular. Their tail is extremely thick. Their hair is raspberry, short and curly. Their eyes are pear and they wear scarlet cateye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their good deeds.
Looking for a list of the best vampire games on PC? Being able to jump really high, tear regular humans to shreds, use creepy magic powers, and replenish health by feasting on your enemies - this should be a staple of all PC games, to be honest. Despite the best efforts of Bram Stoker, Max Schreck, and Stephenie Meyer in trying to make them look bad - everyone ...
Dreamed my parents were playing my porn game and giving me feedback.
In real life, my mom did like a puzzle game I made years ago, and she found most of the secrets on her own, so she wasn't just being mom when she said she liked it. So maybe she'll like my porn game too?
It maybe has too many language subtleties. Need to translate it to Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.
Guess I'll have to see whether Bing or Google is better at translating dirty gay sex puns.
Been toying with this thought for a little while:
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health. Why? Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health. In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible. In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate. It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs. I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary". My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.
I've been, on and off, listening to the works of @iotar
There's a lot of well good stuff in this mysterious collective's backlog. Like krauty moods and other worldly pop music and radiophonic workshop and all sorts. Very much worth having a go at.
Also FWIW I like the archive.org interface a lot more than the desktop #bandcamp \- I've no idea how people use bc as their primary music platform (besides the political reasons).
Playing around a bit with Flutter. I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
(And also: The Web is now largely a Google thing, unfortunately)
Also please refrain from telling me that google/flutter apps suck on iOS and macOS. Cross platform is hard if you want to do it well. I know that.
Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey. A few very small difficulties have come to light. Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed. A small update will be produced next week to correct them. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now. Have a good day!
Tech confession: I can't wrap my head around Grafana & Prometheus, at least from a server/application metrics and monitoring standpoint.
I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.
I want to make dashboards. Grafana looks pretty. Brain no work.
So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
So I thought, screw it! I'll make my own static! Full of people too anxious to try joining a raid static, with no expectations of being good at all! There's... no way that would work, probably!
...And that's how I found myself having to sort out a raid group roster.
I was a voracious reader in my youth. Then, life crushed my soul and I lost all my passion for fiction and great storytelling.
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I'm now on book # 31 and it's only May.
I'm BACK baby!
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm happy that a few people have come to me in private and said "look, because of all your work, I'm gonna grant you this amount of money".
I wanna see these companies that intermediate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They're not gonna talk about this on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.
Is it a danger to let migrants in at the southern border? I dunno. Let them rehabilitate the hollowed out and decaying cities across the country. Again. These people want to improve their lives.
White nationalists, gun fetishists, pro-dictator right wing.. there's the danger. Deport the white supremacists.
I am so tired of the headlines claiming that "Remote work is dead." or that "Remote work was a failed experiment."
These headlines and articles usually reference one CEO at one large company. It's all clickbait but it does worry me about the executives and managers who read these articles.
There was remote work prior to 2020. There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling. It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices. It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space. It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
To just ignore these facts is wrong. Stop generalizing and try to understand how your employees actually get work done.

It's not just conservatives versus progressives, he told a seminar of more than 100 adherents in Grande Prairie.
"This is a war between the pro-humans and anti-humans," he said. Parker referred to abortion, and modern urban women's impulse to delay having children for their careers' sake.
He also argues that NDP and progressives want to depopulate society for the sake of the environment. "You are the carbon they are trying to reduce."
So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones. Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday. Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing. I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays. It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally... I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries. And today is already becoming a great day!
Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World. But I can't be deceived! This is the beginning. The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it! It's a fine day to order ice cream delivery. It was a one dog night and that doggo was not getting off the bed not even for "Dog's Breakfast - Breakfast for Dog's!"
I will zip the lining into my cycle jacket - just in case I need it inside.
Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?
This is for Wikipedia's component library (OOUI). It is mostly semantic HTML with CSS, and generally does not require custom elements (which offers connectedCallback).
We currently use a MutationObserver hack. For performance, we don't observe the whole document. We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).
Casper the #rat is an absolute unit these days. I think my new job has been good for him - two free roams a day while I work, at fairly predictable times.
I finally got a good dangle photo so I can be sure he's not fat. (In #rats, too high body fat can be bad for their health.) He's not. He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day. I don't have a scale to weigh him, but he feels like he's well over a pound. It makes me so happy to see him thriving.

It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones.
No idea why.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone).
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps. Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
That said, I'm biased.
I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.
Their bad reputation haunts them to this day.
But it's the land that makes it a good storer of wealth for as long as you think the government isn't going to change the system we live in. The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced. A lot of ppl think that they literally own the earth when they buy a piece. Not the case. In China you can only lease land. They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever. The government can change these policies whenever it wants. The land is temporary.
It seems inconceivable that land may be taken away one day when you watch Australian and United States media channels but that's because the rich are on there all day ensuring your mind thinks a certain way. The land is very easily and quickly taken away by the government one day if they want to do that. And guess what? It never made sense how ppl can keep land at the expense of others. It has to be taken away one day. That's why the Chinese only allow leases. They already ran out of land.

I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
To agonize over personal failure & guilt in a world where "success" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts...
We're all such messy critters.
But gentling despair at our messiness is crucial - because it gives us more space to tackle the ruins all around.
So try not to forget, eh?
Kindness with ourselves is activism, too.

The prompt this week on Revelations is Stay up all night. I have been toying with this little piece on my head for a few days now. It is definitely more romance than filth. Maybe I have been reading to many romances with impossible 'meet cutes' and this is the result, but I like it. Also one day I am totally gonna do the mile high orgasm, maybe not with a str
I don't agree that #Mastodon is difficult to setup. Common, it's really not that hard. But it's more difficult to find people to follow and build up your timeline. I wish there was a "who to follow" recommendation somehow.
But apart from this, it is not difficult - if you use a 3rd party app like Elk and/or Ivory. If you stick to the default web interface it doesn't look and feel good (imho).
So, it requires a bit more effort to get into it and you probably need a good app to improve #UX.
I don't know if prevention is possible, but it's worth trying. The four steps I outline are up for debate, with some progress in each:
Description: names for incidents of human-algorithm behavior that account for algorithms & humans. Explanation: account for both sides of mutual influence
Forecasting: anticipating harms before they happen (even if by minutes) Interventions: knowledge about things we can do to create change, within some confidence bounds
I didn't watch the CNN town hall, but it seems as if Trump said exactly the same things he says every time he opens his mouth or presses Send on his phone. Even if he didn't get to say them during the town hall, everyone in America will hear them anyway, repeatedly, between now and November 2024.
That's still no reason to give him another venue, but the harm is being exaggerated. He'll win the primaries. We can't will him away. He's here and he's going to say this stuff no matter what.
Signed up for Google's "AI Test Kitchen" waitlist and got in same day. It's very underwhelming at the moment.
The "MusicLM Demo" is mildly interesting. You can ask for a specific piece of music like "jazz with a trumpet solo in 5/4 tempo" and it will generate two tracks for you after a few seconds. It seems to understand tempo, but... the music's just... not good.
Throwing everything you've got over the fence in response to GPT is not it. Try harder Google.
It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress. I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I bench press on my bed. If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, load is going up today. Still feels good.
I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
This is my personal Mandela effect thing. I'd never seen it in a cookbook. I'd never seen it at the fancy grocer or any of the Italian delis. I'd never seen anyone's mom make it or had it shoved at me at a party or seen it appear in conjunction with anyone's saucemaking escapades or baking days
It just appeared one day and suddenly it was available everywhere. I've entered the burrata dimension.
drake's aging iPad is giving out, so she's in the market for a new tablet. Having been radicalized here, we're reluctant to buy a new FAANG machine*. Does anyone have a Linux tablet they love?
This would be mainly for web browsing, occasional email, and some games.
In 1998-06 Gamefan, in relation to the long development of the first Unreal game, Jason Schrieber commented,
"A good game is only late until it ships. A bad game is bad forever."
So was it Epic that originated this? We can keep going.
An earlier issue of GamePro 1997-11 has a quote with far more ambiguity,
"Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships. A bad game is bad for the rest of your life."
Is it so ephemeral then? Merely a "catchphrase" with no clear originator?

Have now done a full round trip on the new ICNG train. I really like it. Esp the carriages with the bigger windows. There's areas that could use some polish. Namely the lack of enough bins, and the lack of signs to explain the significance of the lighting colours.
Fix those minor issues, and then can we have more of these please? I won't be sad to see the end of the ICM or DDZ stock.

#FalconGameBooks
The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected. The rock beneath you gives way suddenly. Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below. The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.
You land the flyer nose upward on the side of the slag heap and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you walk slowly towards them. You halt while still on the mound of crumbled rock and soil and speak to them, saying, 'I come in peace, as a friend.' It appears that they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your Universal Translator picks up no answer. You decide to use your Psychic Awareness to contact them mentally. It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that establishing contact again would be dangerous and return to your flyer, but the experience has cleared your mind which had been befuddled ever since you jumped into the future. Once back in Falcon's Wing you find it quite easy to plot a course for Earth in 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod as you jump.

#today I have coffee, sunshine and quiet time! I started a new shawl. I am unsure of it at this time. I found a unevenly spun silver gray yarn that is mostly finely spun with lumps. I plan on mixing it with a fine purple/lilac variegated cotton. But am not sure I have enough of the purple. I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before. I made the first join last night so we shall see. Wishing everyone a happy Thursday!
However, I hate classes on fine arts and literature, and my school history bears it out.
I have literally tried and dropped EVERY SINGLE ONE. And up until like two years ago, I had no idea until I checked my transcripts.
The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read. I hit most of the classics before eighteen--though that's more a reflection of living in bumfuck nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Brittanica in desperation.
My home is comfortable and wonderful and I am happy there, but I have to be somewhere else in order to chill enough to read fiction during the day without feeling guilty. It's like I'm on holidays and therefore am doing what one does on holidays.
And that's also even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home, and get a little #MECFS ed out from simply being in a strange environment where I'm less able to pace myself and have to remember where things are.
And that's also even though I do still have my to-do list and am organising my life as well.
Humanity is out in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games. What will people think of it? I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game? (I am really hoping so.) The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely. Hoping things go well.
It's ThinkPad day!! Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu. Wish I could take it back to work with me to setup more. But that will have to wait till tonight.
So I finally watched #Heartstopper
Was it overly cute to the point of being twee? Most definitely
Do any of these characters talk human beings? Not even remotely
But did I love it? Absolutely!
what was Olivia Coleman doing here? Did she owe someone money?
Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight. In part, because they'd be taught badly. But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes. Especially with the competition.
Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes. Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability. It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.
So while composting and bloom scrolling are a wonderful reminder to look up, and be aware of life beyond the screen. It is as important to explore servers and IP addresses. Watch seeds being sown & cultivated (and not randomly scattered) by good peeps. These roots are hidden. Work is not visible. But for strong and firm future growth.
Jami slipped the note to him when they passed each other on the path, just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty. He glanced behind him to watch her go, and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She did not look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk room before he pulled the note out and read it in a beam of light coming through the blackout curtains. One block-printed word. He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:
I've met some marvelous new #Mastodon mates lately and want to maintain the trend. Calling into the #Fediverse makes me feel like a whale singing through the vast ocean! Want to join my "pod"? I'd particularly like to connect with more.
Everyone with their hair on fire about CNN can thank Stephen Colbert for the hard right turn. He helped make Chris Licht a national problem.

This was the first time (but won't be the last) that Kaveesha Dilhari has both scored 20+ runs & taken 2+ wickets in the same T20I. She joins a select group of Sri Lankan women to have achieved the all-round feat in the format.
(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly – Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong. So, some files are still – still have weird output. But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.
(PERSON1) Okay, thanks.
(PERSON6) Yeah, that's great. I support this, it's great that, [PERSON7], you have thought of [PERSON11]. And [PERSON11] now has the time. There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening. So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time. Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week. But we should really have the system – ready for – I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's slightly easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening. And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired. So, there is like a natural shortening in the data. It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening. We would put it in the architecture.
(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes. So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future – Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert.
(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be – Can you still hear me? The sound quality is a little worse. So, this should really be done, all the time. So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch. So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.
(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago. Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time, you all... It is not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it". And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems. So, this is known, common. It is always like that. So that's a message for everybody. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording. So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not. And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats. So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it. So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.
And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM. This will not be so frequent. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue on the call, right? I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model. And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied. So, the dictionary will have three col ns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees. And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it. And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries. So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?
(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?
(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik. I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping. I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech. And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours. But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours. And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences. Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers. For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions. And now it won't convert so fast. So, if we take some samples during the training. Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output. So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough. Or at least we might try it.
(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah. So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated. And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call. So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so. And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself. So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration". So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else. So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself. So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded. So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done. [PERSON4], right? The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs? I think it was.
(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think. So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines. And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever. Simply play them. Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works. Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear. It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline. And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us. So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English. So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. Ah, so that's one particle experiment. And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during the training. They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing. Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document. It is highlighted four times. So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session. And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat. And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible. So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced. So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files. And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster. Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it. So there this skill is something that that we need people to have. And we need someone to be responsible for that. And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8]. If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so. And then we need - So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems. So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR. So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday. [PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up. So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5]. If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the - It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.
So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works. At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR. So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure. So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time. End-to-end ASR, which is better in general. And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords. And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms. So that's my suggestion of what we could do. And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that. So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14]. And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?
(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch. So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet. And that's the most urgent problem these days. So, we really could make an impact there.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like - We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.
So, I plan to do it myself. I plan to go there, but we need a backup person. And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording, So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again. And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing. And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow. I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign. It may be difficult to prepare these tables. So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call. To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution. Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free. If that would help us or not. Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7]. So, simple html is probably the way to go. So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up. So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner. Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage. Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html. So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that. So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15]. We know they have like - The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m. They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101]. This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks. I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken. And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric - Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk> So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation. So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right? <parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation. And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right? Yes, so I totally agree. This involves also manual preparation of the reference. So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk> I have one remark from [PERSON1]. So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary. And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk> So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word - So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk> So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously. And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs. So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain. Could you do that?
(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try. It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that. So, I'll write it down. So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk> Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk> And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID? How do we plug that in?
(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class. <unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.
(PERSON11) That is important. Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/> We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/> And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet. That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR. So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language. I just made it up this type of setup. Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes. So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines. Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages. And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output. That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis. But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.
(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense. It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve. Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different. Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?
(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are. Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.
(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right? You do not do any-
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-
(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.
(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/> Coverage is always like 97 percent. It just generates the correct lemmas, just-
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it. So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case.
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually, but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah. So, I was thinking there might be. But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs. But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario. I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?
(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task. But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena. I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover. And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined. So again, not so sure.
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations. And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general. So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial. Well, just a paraphrase. And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence. For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there. So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset. So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization. And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset. So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart.
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea. So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that. Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are... maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.
(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document. So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate.
(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana? I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation. But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-
(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding. So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence, maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know. Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what- when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also, I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position. I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work.
(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right? You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens. So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once. I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear. So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do. Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.
(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue. And send the text back in a HTTP request. Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.
(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with that. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON1) I could think about that. Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server. I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that.
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.
(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks. So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders. We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set, Who do we have here? Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately. So, this would be for [PERSON2], Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this. Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you. We have [PERSON5], that's good. So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important. Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing, Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup. I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs. So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation. And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more. So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon. So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason, Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones, and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on. So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both, but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices. First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints. With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding. Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams. And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff. But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff. Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints. Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]). Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow. Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it. But you only you do that -
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains. And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it. And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party. And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it. So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/> He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay. So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
(PERSON3) Several years ago. MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML. That was in the first year when that happened. And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers. And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon. The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue. So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting. Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people. But your paper is too bad. You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.
(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial. Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.
(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues. They have final paper registration in July. So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper. So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So, there is an absolute strict requirement. And I think it's they cannot have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth publishing. Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event. So yeah, I think it's okay. So, we do not need to ask for a special session. In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that. In Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.
(PERSON7) Ah, okay. But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event. Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.
(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject. But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses. Like to fail because you are unable to finish it. Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass. I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one. Just within the second deadline, you should submit it. That's pretty much the only thing he asked. But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, study for the exam-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation. So, it tries to use a different wording. To, for example, specify the thing. So actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless. But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff. So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.
(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs.
(PERSON7) But in which languages? Because you know I don't speak German.
(PERSON2) English and German.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable. Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information. Sorry, I never thought about it in depth. But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag. So, I put a word into a bag. And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word. And I think that that's the problem with the flicker. If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain. And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not. So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition. Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have. Even though you cannot promise it's good. But I think that we cannot work with this extra information. And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it. If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself. And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly. And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created. Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us. So, I think that it's not good to show extra. Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality. I think that's still better than showing the flicker. Because what would be the real use case? Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really? Like from a user perspective?
(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker. So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves.
(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself. And that's actually what the translators are doing.
(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy. Because there is no concept of speech here. We are directly working on text. But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us. And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us. It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community. We can motivate participants to submit. Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive. So, in archives, people can publish any time, right? So that is not a benefit to their profiles. So how to motivate participants to join our shared task. So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session. But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time. It is only three months.
So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set. So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to. But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us. It is more important to use it as a test session. So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there. And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program. so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important. So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing. The test session is less of an urge. And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that. So, we really need to practice these preparations. With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done. But that is not the case. It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected. So, we need to be there earlier. And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine. Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people. So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little. Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions. I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document. Maybe I forgot to tell all of you. I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020. And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions. So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions. And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording. And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever. Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording. And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex. Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link. I have sent it by email, I remember.
2 bad lemons in a row :( I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us. This season I bought the next size I needed. One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama. I returned it and the company sent me a new one. The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off! I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft
This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.
Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement. I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect! I own a 2013 Corolla LE. I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy. It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes. I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.
Needs improvement
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
Musical Start
The piano is great starters! It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent. It develops a good hand-eye coordination. The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age. If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out! Very worth the money!
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
Someone screwed up the formula?? This is so weird. In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same! I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera. Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this. Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange. No point in calling them red or pink. The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped. The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off. I just wits there were a pink. I guess the purple will suffice.
works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago. I then went and had highlights put in all over my head. A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out. I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye. However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair. Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was. This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments. I tried reading it but I just found the language flat. the "freshwater" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived. I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
I give this book 10 stars! Excellent read!! I absolutely loved the book!! I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves. Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
I really Like this ring light! It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done! The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on. I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.
Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn’t fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
Loved Collins... It took a while to warm up to Grady
3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters. It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth! I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
Good, but would like to find something better
After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago. It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay. However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex. I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon. Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one. Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days. My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
Broke in less than a week
I like the product it’s a nice size and color! Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece! I’m really disappointed! It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?! My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either! The door popped right out again!!
Not too easy to assemble plus.... It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked. I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together. Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly. This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven’t figured out to align them.
BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
Sweetener on the go. Such a convenience! It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!
Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning" Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.
I guess it was easier to break than they thought. I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside. Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back. In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence. I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance. With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.
Easy to install????? Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
Lost package - Re-Charged me
Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars. They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time. After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount. I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher. I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars. Whatever.
Works well after some headaches. Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker. Nothing close! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier. Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
buy the Pampered Chef... I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!
Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it. If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days. Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe. I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house. It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.
Must buy!! I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars! It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!
Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield. Shame on Audubon. The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place." HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards. (Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually "baffle" squirrels!)
I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG! When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out. THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
It’s very small.. Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows. I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.
Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to
First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee. A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you. But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality. Probably best umbrella I’ve had. Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.
Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar. Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product. Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged. We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also. Gave up. They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box. No padding at all.
Cool concept! Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.
Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost. Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay. Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages. The plastic a missing on both. Told warranty expired!!!! Who would check every single cartridge when received???? BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Ok case with serious limitations
This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.
Everything I needed
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs. I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera. The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA). But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.
Ok, needs some improvement. A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote. Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean. As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out. Also the range is a bit inconsistent. I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work. And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog. Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while. I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
You get what you pay for. Horrible product, misrepresented
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it
My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
This product is hazardous to children. This is a huge health hazard to your baby. We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go. The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them. Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well. Please do not buy this product. I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot. Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful. I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one. I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase. I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper. The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive. He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product. 5 stars all the way around!
The physics are terrible and the people that created the game won't do anything about it
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase. The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that. However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you. It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.
