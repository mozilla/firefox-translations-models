One thousand farmers reached the High Court against the bullet train, a dream project of Gujarat&#39;s development.
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the central government&#39;s acquisition of land from farmers in Gujarat for the bullet train, its dream project.
During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers submitted an affidavit stating that the state government did not have the right to acquire their land.
The Chief Justice&#39;s bench issued an ultimatum to the central government, stating that if the central government does not submit a response regarding land acquisition by the 26th, the court will pass a final order.
The High Court has turned a blind eye to the central government, which is diluting even the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
Further hearing on this matter will be held on September 26th.
The High Court pulled up the state government after seeing objections to the affidavits of one thousand farmers from a total of 8 districts of Gujarat in the inter-state bullet train project.
You are misleading the court.
In your presentation, you mentioned that only 4-7 farmers had objections, but here, a large number of farmers have signed affidavits.
Advocate Anand Yagnik, representing the farmers, argued that the central government has not provided a firm response for more than 3 months for the country&#39;s most expensive project worth Rs 1 lakh 10 thousand crores involving more than one state, and is not even following the guidelines of the JICA company.
The central government is trying to prevent the case from proceeding further in the High Court by not submitting a response.
Since neither the central nor the state government has any strong defense against land acquisition, farmers are being threatened by the collector as a last resort.
Blackmail is being used to seize the land as it is under new conditions.
They are being threatened that if they do not acquire the land, it will be confiscated.
Despite the Supreme Court&#39;s order on August 10th, the central government is not submitting a response to the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will again go to the Supreme Court tomorrow to seek enforcement of their order.
A total of more than 3,000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and inform the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about all the facts about the injustice done to them by the central government.
The agreement signed by the central government with JICA also includes a provision to cancel the agreement if injustice is done to farmers.
Farmers will inform JICA about this. Following the agreement signed with the Japanese JICA company for the bullet train, a loan of thousands of crores of rupees has been taken for the bullet train.
But Japan has not yet released the installment of more than 300 crores.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency on par with the dollar, euro, yen, and pound.
Given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles.
International Desk: India and Russia have reached an agreement on the S-400 defense missile system today, amid threats of sanctions from the US.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing this agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
Ahead of approving the S-400 deal, the two countries are engaged in efforts to find a way forward regarding the US dollar for payment of the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles, given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
The US imposed sanctions during the China deal.
It is worth mentioning that in September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
This ban made it almost impossible for China to purchase missiles using US dollars.
However, over the past few years, China has attempted to establish its currency, the yuan, as an international reserve currency against the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been continuously trying at the international level to make the yuan an international currency on par with the dollar, euro, yen, and pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest US dollar reserves in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US may impose a CAATSA (Countering American Adversaries Through Sections) ban on this mega defense deal worth five billion dollars.
Last month, the US imposed this ban on China purchasing the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia had already started to establish alternative arrangements for this deal.
Earlier, an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia was put on hold due to US sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, which was leased from Russia.
Economic analysts claim that to get out of such a situation, India should try to strike a deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth noting that so far, all defense deals signed by India with Russia have been done in dollars.
Why was America&#39;s Katsa law created?
President Donald Trump signed the CATSA Act in August, targeting Russia&#39;s advanced missile defense system. The US has designed this law to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
It is worth noting that this American law has been prepared keeping in mind the activities of Russia.
This includes Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly a thousand-year-old secret was revealed.
Weird and Wonderful Desk: This story is about a man from Turkey who made a big discovery while renovating his house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed while he was doing repairs, he hit a secret door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a city thousands of years old hidden underground.
Pictures of this city show how around 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food and drink arrangements.
600 doors to enter the city:
The incident dates back to 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
While renovating his house, the wall of his basement collapsed.
From here, an underground city called Derinyuku was found, located 280 feet underground.
Its depth was equal to an 18-story building.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with everything from rooms, couches, schools, churches, tombs, etc., to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy gates here, which are meant to prevent intruders from entering the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed separately.
It is believed that this city was built during the Byzantine period between 780 and 1180 AD to keep the people safe during the wars between the Arabs and the Byzantines and natural disasters.
Became a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities, but this is the largest underground city among them.
Only half of this city can be reached, but this place has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

The truth came out in the postmortem report of the birds
International Desk: An incident in Minnesota, USA, of birds falling unconscious and crashing into windows has given rise to many rumors.
Some people said that the birds had fallen prey to blade magic, while others have started associating it with this unusual phenomenon.
When these incidents started increasing in many places in Minnesota, the police started investigating and brought the mystery behind this incident to light.
The birds had become addicted.
The police were receiving many complaints about strange behavior of birds and their falling onto the road.
Troubled by the constant calls, Gilbert police in Minnesota began investigating the matter.
Gilbert police collected these birds, which had crashed into windows and vehicles, and conducted postmortems on them, which made a shocking revelation.
This bird was drunk when it crashed into windows and vehicles.
Now the big question for the police was how did the drugs get into the bodies of these birds?
Is someone plotting to kill the birds?
Or was there another story behind his drunkenness?
The birds were getting drunk from the tree.
The police solved the mystery with the help of experts.
It is said that most of the birds were getting drunk after eating a type of berry (a juicy fruit without a seed).
In England, such berries are called fermented berries.
The sugar in such berries is converted into alcohol through fermentation.
When the birds were eating this fruit, they started getting drunk as soon as they ate it.
This is why it was seen that the birds were flying very low.
The intoxication was causing a state of confusion in the birds, causing them to collide with each other.
Police told how to escape
Gilbert police said it was not possible to stop the birds from eating the fruit.
In such a situation, people themselves have told him how to escape.
Police said that highly reflective windows and windscreens could have prevented it from hitting them.
The police told people through Facebook not to pay attention to any kind of rumors because there is no black magic.

Supreme Court to decide today whether praying in mosque is an integral part of Islam
The High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on the petitions filed by a Muslim group seeking a review by a larger bench of the Supreme Court&#39;s 1994 verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid ownership dispute.
It is worth mentioning that the High Court had said in that decision that praying in a mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Dipak Misra and a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer will deliver their verdict.
The bench reserved it on July 20.
M Siddique, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the M Islail Farooqui case.
Under which it was said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers performed by the followers of Islam.
Siddique has passed away and is being represented by his legal heirs.
Muslim groups have argued before a bench headed by the Chief Justice that the High Court&#39;s observation in this decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member bench.
Because it will have an impact on the Babri Masjid-Ram Mandir land dispute issue.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhawan, appearing for Siddique&#39;s legal representative, said that mosques are not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made this comment without any investigation or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government has told the Supreme Court that some Muslim groups are trying to delay the long-pending Ayodhya temple-mosque land dispute case by seeking a reconsideration of their comment that mosques are not an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, said that this dispute has been awaiting a final decision for almost a century.
The biggest fall in the rupee so far, the rupee reached 71 against the dollar
The rupee fell 26 paise to a low of Rs 71 in early trade today as demand for the dollar increased amid rising crude oil prices.
The rupee opened at Rs 70.95 against the dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market yesterday and later moved to the Rs 71 level.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to currency traders, strong demand for the US currency from oil importers towards the end of the month, trade tensions between China and the US, and the strengthening of the dollar against other major world currencies on hopes of an interest rate hike, all weighed on the domestic currency.
Fears of rising inflation due to rising crude oil prices and the outflow of foreign institutional investors&#39; funds from the domestic stock market have also affected the rupee.
The price of standard Brent crude reached $78 a barrel in early Asian trading.
Sachin Tendulkar made a prediction about Prithvi Shaw in the first meeting itself.
Sports Desk: Prithvi Shaw has made legends his disciples by scoring a century in his Test match debut.
Prithvi Shaw is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as Prithvi has played big innings at the school level, Sachin has also been in the news for playing innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted and congratulated Prithvi Shaw on his century.
Sachin Tendulkar predicted the fate of the planet in the very first meeting.
Sachin Tendulkar also appeared happy with Prithvi Shaw&#39;s start.
Sachin also praised Prithvi.
Sachin recalled the day he first saw Prithvi Shaw bat and what he said about him.
Sharing his experience, Sachin said that about 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chavan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shaw bat.
Chavan said, &#39;This young player wants to meet you and it would be great if you could meet him.&#39;
Sachin agreed with his friend and went to watch him bat.
Sachin said, &#39;I still remember telling my friend that this kid will definitely play for India one day.&#39; Sachin said, &#39;I told my friend that you are looking at the future Indian cricketer.&#39;
Then Sachin&#39;s friend said - Are you telling the truth?
To which Sachin said, &quot;Mark my words, this kid will definitely play for India.&quot;
Sachin Tendulkar talks about the biggest beauty of the planet
Praising Prithvi Shaw, Sachin said, &quot;From what I have seen, he (Prithvi Shaw) learns quickly.&quot;
Having talent in a player is one thing, but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn quickly.
Adaptability (the ability to play according to the circumstances) is essential to playing for long periods of time in different fields and conditions.
I think Prithvi Shaw has the ability to play the game in different situations and this is Prithvi&#39;s biggest strength.
Sachin said that Prithvi Shaw&#39;s hand-eye coordination is amazing.
The way he catches the line and length of the ball is something that is seen in very few players.
This is a natural gift of the earth, which not many players have.

Shocked by the title?
How could the court language of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the destroyer of the Somnath temple and a villain to ordinary Indians, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Delhi University historian Professor Shanta Pandey has made it clear that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Recently, when the Shri Somnath Trust honored Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask whether Sanskrit was only a folk language or the language of the so-called upper caste Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar of Mumbai was remembered.
Pandit Birajdar, 87, who speaks in simple Sanskrit that even a rickshaw puller can understand, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before publication.
In their view, the word Holy Quran is Sanskrit.
Ku + Ran means the voice or teaching of the apostle heard on earth.
Not only did he study at the school in Solapur, but today he is counted among the great Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji, who lives a very simple life, does not seek to go to America or other countries to give lectures as a Sanskrit scholar to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
They teach Sanskrit there without fail.
Those interested in learning Sanskrit from America have to go to the University of Bonn in Germany.
In most universities in India, except for Banaras Hindu University, even Ph.D. dissertations in Sanskrit are written in the language of the respective state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that education in Taxila and Nalanda universities was imparted only in Sanskrit medium.
The prevalence of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, Prof. Shanta Pandey has said that not only was Sanskrit the court language of the Sultan of Ghazni, but he also recorded that he had his coins minted in Sanskrit.
Pandey also notes that the coins &quot;Mahmud Surtran&quot; have verses from the Quran inscribed in Sanskrit and that Panini, the author of Sanskrit grammar, was a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a large chapter titled &quot;The Power and Enduring Power of Sanskrit&quot; in &quot;My Vision of India&quot;, has stated that the Pashto language of the Afghans and Pathans is descended from Sanskrit.
Nowadays, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages are descended from Sanskrit.
Dr. Ambedkar was a supporter of the national language. Another surprising thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the main architect of the Constitution, and some other Muslim and South Indian members of the Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the debate on Hindi versus English as the national language took place in the Constituent Assembly on September 13, 1949, Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language.
The discussion that day and the report published in the &quot;National Herald&quot; on September 11, 1949, give an idea of the importance of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to decide on a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, and Urdu, have a place as official languages in our Constitution, but not a single one is a national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country. We have relegated Sanskrit to the status of a mere decorative object.
Respect for Sanskrit through Nehru: Prime Minister Nehru spoke about Sanskrit with great respect even in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he has devoted himself to Sanskrit and has spoken in detail about the importance that scholars of the world have given to Sanskrit: &quot;As late as 1874, Sir Williams Jones had said, &#39;God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its structure is marvelous.&#39;&quot;
It is more complete than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more refined than both.
Nehru further notes: &quot;I do not know how long Sanskrit has been a dead language, that is, since when it has ceased to be a vernacular language&quot;.
Currently, Sanskrit is only used for prayers or for swearing in as an MP by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani.
We need to preserve the legacy of Sanskrit and make it a living, folk language.
If Hebrew, the dead language of Israel, can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It will only be successful if serious efforts are made to make it a vernacular, rather than just showy or symbolic efforts.
After being welcomed at the airport, who did Narendra Modi gesture to and ask to come with him?

Whatsapp users will no longer be able to do this more than 5 times, feature coming soon
Instant messaging service WhatsApp is going to bring a big feature for its users.
The company has said that to prevent misinformation and fake news in India, they are going to limit the forwarding of messages to five users.
The company informed this via email on Friday morning that more messages, photos and videos are forwarded in India than in any other country.
In such a situation, a new feature is being launched here regarding forwarded messages.
This feature is currently being launched under testing.
After this feature, users will be able to share videos and photos with only five people in India.
The company further said that once videos and photos are shared five times, we will remove the forward option.
It is worth mentioning that WhatsApp&#39;s forward feature was launched on July 11.
After this feature, any user who forwarded a message would get a forward label on it.
This will make it easier for the user to understand which message has been forwarded or not.
On the other hand, in an earlier statement, WhatsApp said that it was consulting academic experts and law enforcement agents to prevent the spread of fake news.
It is worth mentioning that WhatsApp has 230 million users across the country.
Apart from this, if we talk about the number of users using WhatsApp in the entire country, it is 1.5 million.
Shivangi, the Indian &#39;mountain girl&#39; who has scaled mountains on three continents, has scaled Kilimanjaro, Mount Everest, and Mount Elbrus.
He has set this record at the youngest age.
It usually takes 8-12 days to climb such peaks.

They like to face new challenges.
