A thousand farmers reached the high court in front of the Gujarat development dream project bullet train.
The government of the Union has filed a petition in the High Court against the acquisition of land from Gujarat farmers for the Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, a thousand farmers expressed the fact that the state government does not have the right to take over their land by signing a deed.
The bench of the Chief Justice of Guam had given the ultimatum, taking the central government's cue, that the court would issue a final order if the central government did not reply on the land acquisition by the 26th.
The High Court has also turned a blind eye to the central government, which is also blatantly ignoring the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
A further hearing on the matter will be held on September 26.
The High Court took the state government's cue after hearing an appeal against the alleged name of a thousand farmers in a total of eight districts of Gujarat under the Interstate Bullet Train Project.
You are misleading the court.
Your presentation only concerned four or seven farmers, but a large number of farmers were also indicted.
Farmers' lawyer Anand Yaagnikar argued that the central government has not been providing a response to the country's most expensive project of Rs 1 lakh 10 thousand crore, which is linked to more than one state, despite the fact that it took more than three months for the central government to implement it, nor does it follow the company's guidelines.
The central government is trying to prevent the case from going to the high court without giving a reply.
Since the central or state government has no strong defense against land acquisition, the farmers are being threatened by the collector as the last weapon.
Since the newly conditioned land is being blackmailed for land seizure.
The threat is that if the land is not acquired, it will be confiscated.
Despite the order of the Supreme Court dated August 10, the central government has not submitted a response to the High Court.
As a result, farmers will go to the Supreme Court again tomorrow and demand that their order be enforced.
Over 3,000 farmers from eight districts of Gujarat will travel to Japan to save their land and report all the facts about the injustices committed against them by the central government to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
The agreement with Gika, which the central government has signed, also provides for the cancellation of the agreement if it is unfair to farmers.
Farmers will inform Gikagu that a contract for a bullet train with the Japanese company Gika has been signed for the bullet tram, which has been loaned thousands of crores.
Japan has not yet been awarded more than Rs 300 crore in installments.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are looking at the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles.
International Desk: India and Russia today agreed on an S-400 defense missile system amid the clamor of US sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is being approved by the negotiators, who are working on a roadmap between the two countries, including the US dollar for payment of the deal.
Sources claim that given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are looking for ways to make the deal in rupees and rubles.
The US imposed a ban during the Chinese deal.
It should be noted that in September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
Following the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
This ban made it almost impossible for China to buy a missile using US dollars.
However, over the past few years, China has sought to establish its currency, the yuan, as an international currency rather than the dollar.
Since this initiative, China has been continuously trying internationally to make the yuan the international currency equivalent of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency.
This five-billion-dollar mega defense deal could be subject to a US-led counter-American Adversaries through Sections (CAATSA) ban.
Last month, the United States imposed a ban on China from purchasing S-400 missile systems.
India and Russia had already begun to establish an alternative arrangement for the deal.
The US ban on the repair deal for the INS Chakra, which was previously leased from Russia, had led to a seizure of an estimated $2 billion in deals between India and Russia.
The economic analyst Gu Gu claims that to get out of this situation, India should exercise a deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth mentioning that all defence deals India has so far made with Russia have been made using the dollar.
Why did the American sodomy act become law?
In August, President Donald Trump approved the Katsa Act, which targets Russia's modern defense missile system. - The United States has drafted this law to prevent Russia from acting internationally against American interests.
It is worth noting that this American law was drafted in response to Russia's actions.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly, a thousand-year-old secret was revealed.
This story is about a Turkish man who made a big discovery in repairing a house.

600 gates to enter the city of Guigu:
The story is set in 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
During the repair of the house, the wall of its basement collapsed.
From here we found an underground city called Darinyukugu, which is located at a depth of 280 feet underground.
Its depth was about the same as that of an 18-story building.
This underground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with rooms, kitchen, school, church, cemetery, etc. to the preparation of everything from ventilation to the preparation of everything.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy gates here, designed to stop intruders from entering the underground city.
Each floor can be individually sealed.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 CE during the Byzantine era to protect the people from Arab-Byzantine war and natural disasters.
It has become a tourist attraction:
Darinkouyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this, but this is the largest underground city.
It is only halfway through the city, but this space has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.

The truth was revealed in the bird autopsy report of the gu guinea pigs.
International Desk: The incident of birds falling unconscious and colliding with a window in Minnesota, USA, has given rise to many rumors.
Some people said that if the bird was a victim of the blade magic, then Amuk started to associate this unusual phenomenon with it.
When these incidents began to spread in many places in Minnesota, the police began investigating and uncovered the mystery behind the incident.
The birds became addicted.
Police had received numerous complaints about the strange behavior of birds and the way they fell on the road.
Disturbed by the constant calls, the Gilbert Police Department in Minnesota began investigating the case.
Gilbert Police gathered these birds, which had been hit by windows and vehicles, and carried out a port mortem, which was a shocking revelation.
The bird was drunk when it collided with windows and vehicles.
Now the big question for the police was how did the drugs get into the bodies of these birds?
Is there anyone conspiring to kill birds?
Or maybe there was another story behind his drunkenness.
The birds were getting drunk from the tree.
The police, with the help of experts, resolved the issue.
It is said that most birds were getting drunk by eating a type of berry (a juicy fruit without any flavor).

Whether or not prayer in a mosque is an integral part of Islam, the Supreme Court will decide today.
The High Court is likely to pronounce its decision on Thursday on petitions by the Muslim group demanding a large back-up review of the 1994 decision of the Supreme Court on the right dispute over the rights of Ramju Jannam-Babri Masjid owners.
It is worth mentioning that the High Court had said in its decision that praying in a mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazir will pronounce their verdict on the backs of the judges.
The back had secured him on July 20.
A radical M Siddique in the Ayodhya case had objected to this particular conclusion in a 1994 decision in the case of M Ismail Farouki.
Under which it was stated that a mosque is not an integral part of the prayers performed by followers of Islam.
Siddique is dead and is represented by his legal heir.
Muslim communities have argued before the back of the Chief Justice that this decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member back of the High Court's observation.

Sports Desk: Pherethey Shah has made a century in his Test match debut.

On the first visit, the secretary had taken the earth with him.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen happy with this start of Prithvi Shagini.
The Secretary-General also praised the Earth.
Sachin recalled the day he first saw Pratibha Shah batting and said, "Take him away".
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chuhangan once asked me to watch Pṛthī Shāni bat.
Chuhyang said, 'This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it will be fine.'
Sachin believed his friend and went to see his batting.
'He still remembers today telling his friend that this child will one day play for India,' said Sachin.
Then the secretary's friend said - are you speaking the truth?
To which the Secretary had said, "Remember my word, this child will surely play for India".
The secretary told about the greatest beauty of the earth.
Praising the Earth Sha, the secretary told him that what I saw (Earth Sha) learned quickly.
It's different to have talent in a player, but it's more important to show that talent.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to be able to learn quickly.
Adaptability is required to play for long periods of time in different terrains and conditions.
I think that Earth Shagua has the ability to play games in different situations and this is the greatest strength on Earth.

The way he holds the line and the lanth of the ball is very rare in many players.

Did you get a shock from reading the title?
How can the Darbari language of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the ruiner of the Somnath temple and a villain to the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, it is clear from research by Professor Shantha Pande, a historian at Delhi University, that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Now that the Shri Somnath Trust has honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Mani Bhai Prasadpati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to question the question that Sanskrit was only a folk language or only the language of the so-called upper-class Brahmins.
The Punjab scholar, a slave from Mumbai, Dastagir Birjardar, was remembered.
The 87-year-old scholar, who speaks Sanskrit, which is easy for even the Riksha people to understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Qur'an before its publication.
The word holy Qur'an is the Sanskrit word for them.
Kugu + ran means the voice or teaching of the Messenger on earth.
Not only did he himself study at the school of Solapur, but today he is considered one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditguji, who lives a very simple life, does not seek to go to America or other countries to lecture as a Sanskrit scholar to market himself.
Princess Gu of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
He teaches himself Sanskrit there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the United States, Usuko has to go to the University of Bonn in Germany.
In India, the majority of universities besides the Hindu University of Banaras are also offering a Ph.D. thesis in Sanskrit, which is written in the language of that state.
Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that in the universities of Takshila and Nalanda, education was given only in Sanskrit.
Sanskrit practitioner Shantha Pandey has said that not only was the Darbari language of the Sultan of Ghazni Sanskrit, he also noted that he had his own money coins inscribed in Sanskrit.
The Panda also noted that the coins "Mahmud Suratraan" were inscribed with the imported Qur'an in Sanskrit and that the Sanskrit grammar writer Panini was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has said that in a huge chapter in "My Hindu Philosophy", "The power and sustainability of the civilized language" the Afghan and Pusthu languages of Patan derived from Sanskrit.
At present, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprise about the support for the Ambedkar national language is that the chief architect of the constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, and several other Muslims as well as members of the South Indian Constituent Assembly proposed making Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the national language was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949 between Hindi and English, Sanskrit was the national language among those who proposed it, including Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed.
Considering the discussion of that day and the report published earlier in the National Herald of 11 September 1949 BCE, the Sanskrit language's agitation is estimated.
Unfortunately, we still cannot determine a national language.
Twenty-two Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, are listed as official languages in our constitution, but none are national languages.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Nehru, through Nehru, spoke respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In a related chapter of his book, he turned to Sanskrit and explained the importance that Sanskrit has lost to scholars around the world: "In 1874 Sir Williams Jones said, 'God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its design is amazing.
It is more complete than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more polite than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, i.e. when it became a folk language".
At present, Sanskrit is only the language of prayer or taking oaths through members like Union Minister Smarti Irani as a Member of Parliament.
We need to live through the rainy season of Sanskrit and make it a living and folk language.
If Hebrew, the dead language of Israel, can be revived, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only worthwhile if a serious effort is made to make it a folk language rather than a seeming or symbolic effort.
