1,000 farmers move HC against bullet train, gujarat's dream project for development
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from the farmers of Gujarat for the central government's dream project bullet train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers gave affidavits stating that the state government does not have the right to acquire their land.
Taking a dig at the Central government, the Chief Justice's bench gave an ultimatum that if the Central Government does not file a reply on the land acquisition on The 26th, then the court will pass a final order.
The High Court has also turned a red eye to the Central Government, which is swallowing the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
Further hearing in the matter will be held on September 26.
The High Court had pulled up the state government after it objected to the affidavits of 1,000 farmers from eight districts of Gujarat in the inter-state bullet train project.
You are misleading the court.
In your presentation, only 4-7 farmers were said to have objections, but here a large number of farmers have been named.
Advocate Anand Yagnik, appearing for the farmers, argued that the Central government has not been submitting a reply for the country's most expensive project of Rs 1,10,000 crore involving more than one state, even after more than three months.
The central government is making efforts to ensure that the case does not proceed in the high court by not filing a reply.
Since neither the Central nor the state government has any strong defence on land acquisition, farmers are being threatened by the collector as the last weapon.
They are being blackmailed to seize the land as they have lands as per the new condition.
There are threats that if the land is not acquired, it will be confiscated.
Despite the Supreme Court's Order on August 10, the Central Government does not file a reply in the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will again go to the Supreme Court tomorrow and demand that their order be complied with.
More than 3,000 farmers from eight districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and inform the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about the injustice meted out to them by the central government.
There is also a provision to cancel the agreement if injustice is done to the farmers in the agreement made by the Central Government with JICA.
Following the agreement for the bullet train with Japan's Jica Company, a loan of thousands of crores of rupees has been taken for the bullet tram.
But Japan is yet to pay more than Rs 300 crore instalments.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
New Delhi: India and Russia today agreed on the S-400 defence missile system amid threats of US sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the MoU with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
In the way of approving the S-400 deal, the two countries are engaged in the exercise of finding a way between the us dollars for the payment of this deal.
Sources claim that given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles.
Us imposed sanctions during China deal
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
Due to this ban, it became almost impossible for China to buy missiles using US dollars.
However, in the last few years, China has tried to establish its currency yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been constantly trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants yuan to become an international currency
The United States may impose a CAATSA ban (Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions) on this mega defense deal of five billion dollars.
Last month, the US imposed sanctions on China for buying the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia had already started establishing alternative mechanisms for the deal since that time.
Earlier, an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia was eclipsed due to us sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, which was taken on lease from Russia.
Economic analysts claim that in order to come out of such a situation, India should exercise the deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
So far, all the defense deals that India has made with Russia have been done through dollars.
Why was America's KATSA law made?
President Donald Trump approved the CAATSA law in August in view of Russia's modern defense missile system. The us has prepared this law to prevent Russia from acting against America's interests at the international level.
It is worth mentioning that this law of america has been prepared keeping in mind the activities of Russia.
These include Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, its annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

The incident dates back to 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered the underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city called Derinyuku was found at a depth of 280 feet under the ground.
Its depth was equal to an 18-storey building.
The underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with everything from rooms, coaches, schools, churches, tombs, etc., to preparations for everything, including ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy gates installed here to prevent infiltrators from entering the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed separately.
The city is believed to have been built between 780 and 1180 AD during the Byzantine period to protect people from wars and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Byzantines.
Tourist attraction became:
Derincuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities but this is the largest underground city among them.
Only half of the city can be reached but the place has turned into a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

The post-mortem report of the birds revealed the truth
The incident of birds falling unconscious and colliding with a window in Minnesota, USA, has given rise to many rumors.
Some said the birds have become victims of blade magic, while others have started associating it with the unusual phenomenon.
When these incidents started increasing in many places in Minnesota, the police started investigating it and brought out the mystery behind the incident to everyone.
The birds had become addicted.

In such a situation, people themselves have been told how to avoid it.
Police said a window and windscreen with more reflection could prevent it from hitting.
Police told people through Facebook not to pay heed to any kind of rumours as there is no black magic.

Supreme Court decides whether namaz in mosques is an integral part of Islam or not
New Delhi: The High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on a batch of petitions filed by muslim groups seeking reconsideration of the Supreme Court's 1994 verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute by a larger bench.
It is worth mentioning that the High Court had said in that decision that namaz in the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer will deliver its verdict.
The bench had kept him safe on July 20.
M Siddiq, one of the original litigants in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 judgment in the Case of M. Ismail Farooqui.
Under which it was said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by followers of Islam.
Siddiqui has passed away and is represented by his legal heirs.
The Muslim groups have argued before a bench headed by the chief justice that the high court's observation in the decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member bench.
Because it will have an impact on the Babri Masjid - Ram Temple, land dispute.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for Siddique's legal representative, said the mosque was not an integral part of Islam.
The remarks were made by the high court without any scrutiny or considering religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim groups were trying to delay the long-pending Ayodhya temple-masjid land dispute case by seeking reconsideration of their remarks that the mosque was not an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, said that the dispute has been awaiting a final decision for almost a century.
Rupee hits all-time high of 71 against US dollar
The rupee depreciated by 26 paise to a low of 71 against the US dollar in early trade today on increased demand for the american currency amid rising crude oil prices.
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened at 70.95 against the US dollar yesterday and then moved to 71.
The rupee had settled at 70.74 against the US dollar on Thursday.
According to currency traders, strong demand for the US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, trade tensions between China and the US, as well as the strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies of the world in the hope of raising interest rates, weighed on the domestic currency.
Fears of rising inflation on the back of rise in crude oil prices and the domestic stock market's outflow of foreign institutional investors have also weighed on the rupee.
At the beginning of Asian trade, the price of standard Brent crude reached $ 78 barrels.
In the first meeting itself, Sachin had made a prediction about Prithvi Shaw.
Prithvi Shaw has made the legends his favorite by scoring a century in his Test match debut.
Prithvi Shaw is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as Prithvi has played a big innings at the school level, Sachin has also been in the discussion by playing an innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted and congratulated Prithvi Shaw for scoring a century.
In the first meeting itself, Sachin had predicted about Prithvi Shaw.
Sachin Tendulkar was also happy with prithvi shaw's debut.
Sachin also praised Prithvi.
Sachin recalled the day when he first saw Prithvi Shaw bat and said something about him.
"About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chavan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shaw's batting.
"This young player wants to meet you and it would be nice if you can meet him," Chavan said.
Sachin obeyed his friend and went to see his batting.
"He still remembers telling his friend that this child will definitely play for India one day," tendulkar said.
Then Sachin's friend said- Are you telling the truth?
To which Sachin said that you remember my words, this child will definitely play for India.
Sachin spoke about Prithvi Shaw's biggest achievements
Praising Prithvi Shaw, Sachin said, "What I have seen, he (Prithvi Shaw) learns quickly.
Having talent in a player is a different thing, but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn quickly.
In order to play for a long time in different grounds and conditions, it is necessary to have adaptability (ability to play according to the conditions).
I think Prithvi Shaw has the ability to play according to the game in different conditions and that's the biggest strength on earth.
Sachin said that the coordination of Prithvi Shaw's hands and eyes is amazing.
The way he catches the line and length of the ball, this is seen in very few players.
This is the natural gift of the earth, which is not there in these players.

Shocked to read the title?
How could sanskrit be the darbari language of Mahmud Ghazni, the sultan of Ghazni, who was the vandal of the Somnath temple and a villain for the common Indian?
In fact, the research of Professor Shanta Pandey, a historian of Delhi University, has made it clear that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Recently, when the Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask whether Sanskrit was only a folk language or only the language of the so-called upper caste Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Birajdar of Mumbai was remembered.
Pandit Birajdar, 87, who speaks in simple Sanskrit that even rickshaw pullers can understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before its release.
The word "Holy Quran" is, in his view, Sanskrit.
Ku + Ran means the voice or voice of the apostle heard on earth.
Not only did he study at the Pathshala in Solapur, but he is one of the great Sanskrit scholars of the country today.
However, Panditji, who lives a very simple life, does not want to go to America or other countries to give lectures as a scholar of Sanskrit to market himself.
The Princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
He teaches himself Sanskrit there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from America, those who want to go to The University of Bonn in Germany have to go.
In India, except for the Banaras Hindu University, most of the universities also have Ph.D. dissertations in Sanskrit which are written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that in Takshashila and Nalanda Universities, education was imparted in Sanskrit medium only.
Prof. Shanta Pandey has said that not only was Sanskrit the darbari language of the Sultan of Ghazni, but he also noted that he had his money coins inscribed in Sanskrit.
Pandey also notes that the coins were inscribed on "Mahmud Suratran" in Sanskrit and panini, the author of sanskrit grammar, was a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a large chapter titled "The Strength and Enduring Power of the Sanskrit Language" in "My Vision of India", says that the Pashto language of The Afghans and the Pathans has descended from Sanskrit.
Today, it is accepted by all that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages have been derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprise is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, and some other members of the Constituent Assembly, muslim as well as South Indians, proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On September 13, 1949, when the Constituent Assembly discussed the national language, among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language were Deputy External Affairs Minister Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed.
The discussion of that day and the report published earlier in the "National Herald" of September 11, 1949, give an idea of the rebellion of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to decide any national language.
Twenty-two Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as official languages, but there is no national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Nehru also spoke about Sanskrit with great respect in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he has turned to Sanskrit and has explained in detail the importance given to Sanskrit by the scholars of the world: "In 1874, Sir Williams Jones said, "God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its composition is wonderful.
It is complete than the Greek language, more abundant than the Latin, and more decent than the two.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, i.e. since when it has died as a folk language".
At present, Sanskrit is just the language of prayer or swearing-in as an MP through members like Union Minister Smriti Irani.
We need to preserve the year of Sanskrit and make it a vibrant and popular language.
If Hebrew, israel's dead language, can be revived, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only if a serious attempt is made to make it a public language rather than a visible or symbolic attempt.
