At the international level, China tries to make the yuan at the same level of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar, the international currency
In view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles.
India and Russia today agreed to the S-400 defence missile system amid US sanctions threats.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
Along with the approval of the S-400 deal, the deal is in the process of taking the US dollar for payment of the deal.
Sources claim that given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupees and rubles.
The U.S. banned during the Chinese deal
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
Due to this ban, the purchase of missiles was almost impossible for China using the US dollar.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to raise its currency yuan as an international currency compared to the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been constantly trying to make the yuan equivalent to the euro, yen and pound equivalent to the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US may impose a countering American Adversaries Through Sections-CAATASA on this five-billion-dollar mega defense deal.
Last month, the US imposed sanctions on China on the purchase of the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia have started from that time to set up an alternative system for the deal.
Earlier, due to the US ban on the INS Chakra's repair deal on leased out from Russia, an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia was eclipsed.
The Economic Analyst claims that in order to overcome such a situation, India should exercise the deal by using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
So far, all the defence deals with India have been made with Russia through dollars.
Why did the U.S. law be made?
President Donald Trump in August approved the Katsa law in view of this modern defense missile system of Russia. The US has drafted this law to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States at the international level.
The U.S. law has been prepared in keeping with Russia's activities.
This includes Russia's attack on Ukraine and capture Crimea, join the Syrian civil war, and interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then, a thousand-year-old secret came to the fore.
This is a story of a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing the house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed while repairing, it collided with a secret door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he faced with a thousand-year-old city hidden inside the ground.
Pictures of this city show how about 20,000 people used to live in this underground city with all their belongings and food and food arrangements.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident took place in 1963 when a Turkish man from Capappadosia discovered the city of Underground.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here found an under-ground city named Darinyuku, which was present in depth of 280 feet within the ground.
Its depth was equal to the 18-storey building.
The underground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with all the preparations, including rooms, coaches, schools, churches, tombs, etc., from ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter the city and get out of here.
There are heavy doors installed here, which are to prevent the infiltrators from entering the underground city.
Each floor can be closed separately.
The city is believed to have been built between 780 and 1180 ESV during the Second-Centen period to protect people from the war between the Arabs and Beontin and natural disasters.
It became a tourist attraction:
Darinkuyu is not the only under-ground city in the world.
There are many other such cities, but this is the largest underground city.
Only half of the city can be reached, but this place has been converted into a popular tourist attraction in Capappadocia.
Due to its historical and cultural significance, people come here to see it.

How can the courty language of Mahmood Ghazni, Sultan of Ghazni, who is the villain for the Somnath temple and the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, the research of Delhi University's historian Shanta Pandey has become clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
Recently, when Shri Somnath Trust respected Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, it was natural to question the only language that Sanskrit was the language of the so-called high-lying Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastgir Birajdar was remembered by Mumbai.
Eighty-six-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who spoke in simple Sanskrit, even today, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the holy Kurran before publication.

Ku + Raan means the voice or enlightenment of the apostle on the earth.
Not only did he study in the Pathshala in Solapur, today he is among the great Sanskrit scholars of the country, who are considered to be fingertips.
Panditji, who is living a simple life, does not seek to give his definition as a Pandit of Sanskrit in America or other countries to market himself.

Shanta Panday, a Sanskrit translation in Afghanistan, has said that not only was the courtier language of the Sultan of Ghazni, but he has also recorded his money coins in Sanskrit.

Dr. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, and some other members of the Muslim and South Indian Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the language of the national language was discussed in the Constituent Assembly against Hindi against English on 13th September, the Deputy Ministers of External Affairs Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed were among the proposers of Sanskrit.
The debate of that day and the report published in the National Herald of 11th September 1949, the buoyance of the Sanskrit language is estimated.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to define a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, are the official languages in our Constitution, but the national language is not the same.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit has now been Sanskrit as the mother tongue of only 24,821 people of the country.
Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, Nehru, also spoke very respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In his book related chapters, he has turned to Sanskrit and the scholars of the world have given the importance of Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir Williams said, "God knows how ancient Sanskrit language is, but its composition is wonderful.
It is more abundant than the Greek language, more abundant than Latin and more than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has become a folklore, it has become a folk language".
At present, the language of taking the oath of office through members of Union Minister Smriti Irani as a Sanskrit language prayer or an MP has been.
We need to preserve the year of Sanskrit and make it live and folk language.
If the dead language of Israel can revive Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only if a serious effort is made to make it a folk language instead of showing or symbolic efforts.
