When hydrogen molecules connect to creating more heavy elements, the energy produced by the stars emits light and heat.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can create energy in the same way.
However, it is very difficult to solve this problem and it will take years for us to build useful fusion reactors.
Due to the vertex, steel needles float on the surface in the water.
Surface tension occurs when water molecules on the surface of the water are more strongly attracted than the atoms of the air above them towards each other.
Water molecules create invisible skin on the surface of the water that can float objects like needle over the water.
The blade of modern ice skates has an intergular cavity between the two edges. Both edges, even though tilted, keep the snow well-generated.
Since the bottom part of the blade was slightly bent, when the blade tilts on one side or the other side, the edges that are in contact with snow also become curved.
This causes the skater to rotate, if the skatus tilts to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the squilts tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
They should get rid of the excess energy from the light, so that they return to their previous energy level.
"It does this by extracting the fine particle called ""photon"" of light."
"Scientists call this process ""the ""praditate secretion of the ray"" because the atoms are illuminated by bright light, which causes the secretion of a photon of light, and light is a form of radiation."
The second picture shows that the molecules take out the photons. Of course, in fact, the photons are much smaller than the ones are in the picture.
The photons are smaller than the material that makes atoms.
After hundreds of working hours, the fibers in the bulb eventually burn and the light bulb does not work after that.
Then it is necessary to change the bulb of light. Care is required to be changed to the bulb of light.
First, it is necessary to turn off the switch or loose the cable for repair of the light.
Because in the socket where there is electricity communication, the metal portion of the bulb sits, if you touch the metal base of the bulb inside the socket or even the bulb can give you a serious lightning shock when it is partially inside the socket.

Other scientists argue that since these plants are very toxic, there is no possibility of any dinosaurs eating them, today other animals such as sloths and parrots (dynosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How will I have to stretch the gravity of IO? If you stand on the surface of the IO, your weight will be less than what was on Earth.
A person whose weight weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) above. So gravity, of course, draws you less.
The sun does not have an earth-like crust that you can stand. The whole sun is made up of gases, fires, and plasma.

The disadvantage of the zoom lens is that the complexity of the center and the number of lens components needed to achieve different focal lengths is much higher than the prime lens.
This problem is diminished when lens manufacturers achieve high standards in the production of lenses.
This allows zoom lenses to produce quality images compared to the quality achieved by a specific focal length lens.
Another disadvantage of the Zoom lens is that the maximum aperture (motion) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light conditions without flash.
Overscan is the most common problem when attempting to convert a film to DVD format.
