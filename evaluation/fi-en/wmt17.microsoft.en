The 28-year-old chef was found dead at a shopping mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, stating, "His affairs were finally going well."
The body, which was found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined a homicide and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line chef at Sons &; Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they are "appalled and devastated" by her death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight-knit family and he will be sorely missed," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "things were finally going well for him".
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he knew of no one who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling a sense of belonging with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees go on strike: Calls for new industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have asked their union to accept new industrial action in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is asking the entire Council to support further industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
Medical trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of Members who voted.
In a letter to members posted Thursday night via Twitter, JDC Chair Ellen McCourt said the board had remained "stubbornly silent" on issues that she said led to the agreement being rejected.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorize a gradual and expanding industrial action programme starting early in September.
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have taken part in six strikes this year, including the first total work stoppage in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
The BMA's head of medical trainees, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a vote rejected the terms recommended by the BMA that had been negotiated in the agreement.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the 54,000 medical trainees and students voted that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare the eight-month battle over words and economic sanctions over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, there was a shake of hands.
But Putin's smile seemed forced, and he didn't exude much warmth, even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke about his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I messed up the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astonishing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was nearly ousted from power in last month's failed coup.
The constant terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights finally resume.
They are hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report of the Vedemosti newspaper put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what is seen as a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to that the long-standing resentment over the snail's fast-paced EU accession negotiations, and Putin emerges, eager to exploit the coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored points in Ankara, where he called after the attempted revolution to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So this meeting in a grand seaside palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to introduce an "alliance of outsiders," as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they hadn't even addressed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian warplane, it is certainly better for the two leaders to be on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
Since nearly collapsing eight years ago and having to be rescued, the bank has abandoned these ambitions.
The bank's strategists have been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands during this time.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been felt right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is available for Scottish customers, but will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except headquarters and stock exchange listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are gaining more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees as we will now become much more of a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I am saying that we no longer have global targets, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time for us to move in the direction of a brand bank because fundamentally (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win he has a total of 3000 wins
Rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second win of the night on his home track, competing in the John Gosden-coached Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in horseback riding.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humbled.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilection out after victory.
Two racing riders have reached this milestone in obstacle racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical flair sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago on Epsom that he would have ridden 6000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big races!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is awesome to see.
He's a lively person, which is good for British competition, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with his trademark high-flying descent from the saddle.
From flying finishes to high-flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British raceriding for two decades.
It's been a rollercoaster.
Heaps of victories in major races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from racing due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a tough start when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed remarkable strength of character in challenging the doubters and returning in his best form.
And he may continue for a long time to come - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanov to step down as head of Russia's presidential administration," but no reason was given.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He later headed the president's protocol and government staff, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be appointed to replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, worked for the KGB, the Soviet security service.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced – especially now, just before the general election.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real skepticism.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust four years of responsibility for this very complex, one might even say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of Russia's Security Council and a former member of the KGB, the state security service, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, the state security service that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President Putin of Russia after a second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was given the boot after hitting a producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
The show's producers, ABC Studios as well as CBS Television Studios, announced his firing in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and strife on set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson's character will be removed from the series about the FBI agents team are expected at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it my all for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans the series can have.
The start of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man who lives in Banff has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could be sandeels left behind by the water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 feet from the ocean, posted film footage of the apparition in Periscope, hoping someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
€1.35 billion The pound sterling project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry flyover as well as a viaduct, meaning the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "deck fans" that are now being completed around each of the bridge's three pillars.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
€1.35 billion The pound sterling project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry flyover.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this section of bridge alone."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extremely precise dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck of the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
Once the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, i.e. inland, side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern passage 700 millimetres in a southerly direction.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Demanding, because the permissible dimensional deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men tried desperately to swim to safety as their boat continued forward on their own.
"We saw the boat circle closer to the men and imagined the worst," Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones said.
"Luckily a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got going," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third, 60-year-old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken into a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some activity.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, more recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity aren't mutually exclusive.
I'm referring, of course, to a craze called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they spawned cartoons, playing cards, and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had been somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked using GPS and can be "photographed" (using a screenshot of their phone) or "caught" once found.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people exercising 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent among users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level information.
Many public health campaigns' calls to "find 30," "get up from the couch," and "be active every day" have yielded no results because most public health warnings are boring and passed on by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Being active helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving spoilers of joy look for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There has been a breakthrough.
Although there used to be apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn't give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty charm disappears and the use fades in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people who hunt to be more active, fit, and healthier.

Simone Biles snatches gold in women's gymnastics all-around
Forget the pressure.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth with boom.
Incredible on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast clinched the all-around title on Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world exposed in the Olympic spotlight.
Her overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States on the balance beam in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around individual final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win a consecutive all-around title, and fifth overall American champion. At the same time, he cemented his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps of all time.
She burst into tears when her final score was announced, and her long journey towards this moment came to an end.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken his sport to the next level:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, in programs whose blend of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've seen."
The final test awaited in Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and the other contestants, but between her and the burden of exaggerated expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals (in that order) in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around individual final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, elok.
Biles clinched her first medal Tuesday when she served as the culmination of the departure ceremony for retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
While Biles claimed that she has never thought about the future as she walks her long road to the top, that's not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes his trademark volt beat - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for a street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted as a toddler by her grandparents and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother while on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerhouse.
She hasn't lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and that winning streak is likely to continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina had a slight lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and stall, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He came out on top with boom points of 15.433 and surpassed them with 15.933 stalls.
Raisman hugged her good-naturedly as they waited for the final points—a mere formality—and tears welled up in Biles' glitter red, white, and blue linerd eyes as the dream she once wrote about in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was something of a revenge from four years ago, when he was tied for third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call "grandma", was clearly in the lead.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his performance on the floor in a heat of emotion about returning that at times seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's widespread tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl killed in the deadliest attack in the first serial killer case in Phoenix last decade were sitting in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot. This was stated in a police bulletin released on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
According to the release, the gunman, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2900 that another adult victim had.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in four months in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
"These are happening in a residential neighborhood in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS affiliate KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police bulletin about the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple homicide and targeted an empty pickup van. This is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "The situation is getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I can't do this.
I cannot do this.
I did not commit myself to this.
Which is not true at all - of course I agreed," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
In addition, he loves to play with his two brothers, as well as sing.
Elizabeth shows how signs invented by Edmund are used to sign, "Would you sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not ordinary sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional strain of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What will happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prediction in ages, because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation is getting easier.
You can believe that the situation will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding triggered rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana, as well as southern Mississippi, overflowed and posed a widespread flooding threat due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to counties in need.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they are receiving requests for high-tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone caught tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is in effect through Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five inches of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood alert was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana and were forecast to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said there is a threat of flooding of Ascension County, further down the river, as flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River was at an all-time high at nine o'clock on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people up from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, along with his wife and stepson, were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says the water in Beaver Creek, normally located more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
She says another stepson who lives nearby warned her.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen the creek water so high in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have disabilities and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said first responders rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where the rescued stayed Friday.
Krautmann says the floods will "quickly spread widely" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain that had continued since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to residents of Tangipahoa County being rescued from their homes and classes canceled in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a member of the Tangipahoa city council said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County chairman Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets stranded by high tide.
Shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, about two dozen streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood here was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Management Director Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but so far no flooding incidents have been reported Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain still continues."
'Full of bullets' six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that he was named Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; The other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was crossfire at the scene between several shooters.
Assault weapon-type shells, derived from various assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly examining the CCTV footage.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
Thus, I call the gymnastics team of this year's Women's Olympic Games, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastic programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win consecutive individual gold in the women's all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman received silver.
We see the pinnacle of the sport, but this is not how it looks in gymnastics halls across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they made the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (last five), because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the gymnastics team, and this will be Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, train in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list goes on.
A large number of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where the many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Latino) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and academic and work performance.
This team inspiration gets thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in exciting times.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing serious "girl strength" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to embark on the path to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical juniors staging new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was "in uncharted territory" and that even small further delays would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior physicians will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to nighttime and weekend working methods to improve care during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Committee of Physician Trainees, said in a statement last night: "Medical juniors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it will accelerate the existing workforce crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and, at times, deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanction and take into account the concerns of junior doctors.
If he fails to do so, junior doctors are ready to take further industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were postponed as nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on the picket.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, appealed to junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but it puts pressure on teams and services that are already in a precarious situation, causing concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from a sabbatical, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are in November, February and May about the BMA's respect for agreements reached.
A drug costing two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from the two-pound-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of relapses in people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or second attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140 000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these have a second heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter accumulated in the artery wall, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes off, it can travel with the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective anti-progression therapies, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to increase the treatment options available to the several thousand people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding - over periods of more than three years are limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles berates police, election wardens and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to "racial and religious sensitivity."
The former community secretary, now the emperor of anti-corruption, said voter intimidation on religious grounds was so serious that police should be allowed to set up guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indestructible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls for greater press access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would protect local governments from a broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report following the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "conducted his election campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting impersonating someone else.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found throughout the country.
He raised particular concerns about electoral fraud in mail-in voting, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
His report says: "There was evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of elders, especially in communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin.
"Concerns were raised that ... Such behavior had been ignored by state institutions due to 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for cleaning up the system. These included banning political activists from handling mailed ballots in order to stop "vote collection".
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher checks on registrations to prevent electoral records from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Review options for proving voter identity before voting.
Apply indestructible ink to the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail-in voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made mail-in votes and envelopes in which votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polling stations illegal.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff stick to the rule that voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric has slammed Greater London Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after Tower Hamlets.
"The electoral tribunal was recused as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
On numerous grounds, he was found guilty beyond doubt, according to the standard of criminal proof.
He also criticized ineffective "tick-in-the-box checks" at city council voting registration offices.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage of giving birth to parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation."
Crazy about Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other celebrity photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone berserk over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive doppelgänger.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger — at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger found on a bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how one particular archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
US men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures surfaced of him looking eerily like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, after becoming aware of the frenzy on social media, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he has heard that he looks like Leo.
"Personally, I don't see much resemblance, except maybe in terms of beards," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 is sure to emerge this year as well: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Move up a gear: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom share similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova has more in common with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team resembles "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt," according to fans.
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Putting forward the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the US football star and Dexter actress do indeed have incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautifully wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer 'dead like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay infuriated viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer had "disappeared like a bad smell" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's commentator team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China roared, baby.
Too zealous, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in a time of 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did a CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the live air."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200m relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China roared, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist gang. #inhottavaa."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment about the swim's performance got on air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and pasted an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The broadcaster also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live on air and attempted to define his remark by stating that he did not intend it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," she said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
"Needless to say, I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's customer stunned by a woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
Customers didn't know where to look when the woman undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try on her underpants.
Things didn't get any better that after evaluating how he looked in the pants, the woman peeled them off her head and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to go around and eventually fitted four pairs of briefs in a shop located in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on underpants and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the store, said that after trying on the lingerie, the mysterious woman "redressed and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store's floor, grabbed a pair of underpants, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her fittings.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for the Atonement, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone stared when she took off her underpants again and clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same for three more couples before finally deciding she didn't like anything she saw, got dressed again and walked out.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching — or thinking about the person who would end up buying the briefs she was trying on."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident of the city of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone takes home underpants that someone else has tried but haven't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I understood that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be horrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven't been washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of an incident that took place at the Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn from sale."
How to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to New York-based Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrachi to figure out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether approached from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay an attacker in equal measure.
According to Mizrachi, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attackers and "clear the line of fire."
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by striking the groin with your knee, and when the attacker goes out of pain, wring the gun out of his hands, hitting him in the face with the butt of the gun, and backing away, keeping the gun aimed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it over so that the criminal is not able to fire.
At the same time, put weight on the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grasp, retreat and point the gun at him.
Sound awkward?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster, the safest way out of a heist situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most nocturnal spots.
Suffolk presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called On the Trail of Inner Power, yielded surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in his mouth with a bad taste.
Wright became known for testing his gut endurance as he traveled the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, from public railings at train stations to the flush button on the toilet, actually tested his immune system.
In the film, he said, "Since I was a kid, I've been pretty carefree about my health, putting all kinds of things in my mouth, starting with soil, worms and muddy water."
Indeed, he confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of more than 4000 units on the photometer.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have a reading below 60.
But in one Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveller's film, Traces of Inner Power, together with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything, because there's a lot going on here.
On the trail of inner strength was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost people's gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's Director of Snacks, Juice and New Categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and ended up thinking, 'Let's call Ian.'"
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to talk about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the documentary, added: "Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked of him, like the Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things to lick were easier for Ian, while others were quite awkward.
I'm glad we were able to capture some of those dirty licks."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents specifically associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of buggers destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of buggers caused £50,000 in damage to their rented house after they were evicted for terrorising neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being the subject of numerous complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing association officials found the property to be in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, floorboards had been torn, debris had been scattered on the floor, and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, property manager at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property cannot be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are plenty of points to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is disreputable, and their name is disreputable."
The couple had three sons who occasionally lived on the property, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was found guilty of antisocial behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in many rooms of the house threatened with demolition.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs were previously distributed, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move in voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors praised the eviction, saying their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We have seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighborhood executive director at Cornwall Housing, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down the wild wall of a rented house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and that of his family, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the brave community members who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms
The housing company's employees now have to clean up the waste piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g of cannabis, scales, supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to distribute it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the tombstone of his son, Lee Skeldon. He died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless, having now been left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house had graffiti smeared on the walls.
Police say they are working to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the shore
Sun-worshipping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept past from a very low altitude
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
It was at this moment that terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows the military aircraft coming within almost touching distance of sun worshippers on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers stood up when they became understandably concerned about the noise coming from the jet, even though they couldn't see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer, with four deaths on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that impaired visibility, smoke from wildfires and thick fog
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote's first-half result better than expected
In January–June, the South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a result EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
Eksote's result showed a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has made it possible to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for procedures.
Eksote uses the surplus to cover the deficit that has arisen earlier.
The remainder will perhaps be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers took the military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took the military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The oath ceremony for the tenth Special Border Jaeger course was held at the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Jaegers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become Special Border Jaegers.
250 of them were invited to the entrance examinations.
Special border jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting held in connection with the oath ceremony was attended by five veterans of the wartime border forces.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the crook - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had an RTA (Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit).
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is led by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The officer's supervisor is the Chief Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, collected information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less common for the police to go to the scene with whistles only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
As part of the reform of police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, three national units under it and a separate criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation, manages operations nationwide.
As the name implies, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Reconnaissance extends beyond one's own area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his or her 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an emergency task database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, prolific criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of acting.
The handprint can also be seen in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of making, a certain image of the perpetrator is formed.
Serialisation can be carried out either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which one the police have more information about.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees do not walk around town with collars up, but their work is not fully public.
Both their own methods and those used by criminals are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities in order to prevent police attempts to prevent crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, reported in the news at the beginning of the summer, a method of marking empty dwellings used in burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest ones order the minutes of the district court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, the thieves will go out with gloves on.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Chief Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Chief Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the National Bureau of Investigation were interviewed for the article.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
This is due to a decrease in the amount of manpower and funding.
The first steps towards the new way of working were taken already 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-phase Pora reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the department and Finland.
ISIS-linked schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumoured to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she had died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organisation's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others, that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone — that it could dissuade people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose a person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicts "with some certainty" Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rock the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "henchmen" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men."
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, chairman of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine, which features plenty of nudes, is different from old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start introducing timeless and classic nudity again, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked female bodies," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill the comment section with irritated insults written by the pseudonym Not AllLoneMiddle-AgedMen, note that this argument is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked about revival of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are getting excited about the novelty of physical objects, but because of the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are least likely to buy records.
It's not just about collecting for amateurs, it's also about emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would gesture briskly before stopping, forming a cup from my hands, and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's investigate further."
Let's explore the issue in more detail.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed — hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supply stores now fill buildings that once housed independent stores — a handful of stunning specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in his twenties), spends his afternoon in London meeting up, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I ask if he is a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 discs.
These plates, shown in the photo above (he emailed the shot, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can rebuy the ones he sold when he was young and penniless.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the clients she encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that records have come back into fashion and have felt the need to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I have had, people have gotten rid of their collections, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakeners of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the albums?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community of like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage lucky days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it to be true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker said abruptly from the stack of records.
An April ICM poll revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers don't have one.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I scroll through the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "reward" aspect of revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone recently came in and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It is not a large percentage, but it will definitely happen.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not older people, but younger people, late teenagers who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, which nowadays has almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their seventies, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned shops - the speakers are fresh with Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove a nagging psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at the various records on sale.
He's window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on your computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." He sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look like I'm researching denim shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls briefly gathering around Polaroid cameras before father and daughter ponder buying Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered in records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records from any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyl".
But given that even a little attention these items get can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least for record stores in Soho, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores, flipping through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old faux television presenter as he peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied sharks, says the record is held by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters tall.
French court rejects application to demolish deals in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which houses thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in which people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's Office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a non-tax-paying parallel economy and because they pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying free meals provided by a state-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those who need them.
A court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting the 72 people running the temporary shop, but said the Calais prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafés and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people "living in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates on a non-profit basis and provides 200 meals daily, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for the hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are just eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people — the highest number — after the number of arrivals soared over the summer.
Food prices are falling clearly faster in Finland than in the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply, much to the delight of consumers and annoyance of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in Finland in three years, while the average price in EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food has fallen the second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels as in Finland.
Of the peer countries, only the UK has seen a faster fall in food prices than in Finland.
These data derive from an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published on the Tieto &; Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
Now the price is depressed by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policies have helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Intensified price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the price decline.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven for affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparison countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT must be halved to the average level of EU countries and price competition continues," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made with regard to the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer quite what it used to be
A person returning to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guideline that all schools in Finland follow.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan states the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
For example, learning to write fiction will be abandoned and coding will be practiced in schools instead.
Swedish education begins already in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin already in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that teachers teach students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, an attempt is made to make schooling more interesting.
The longest-lived vertebrate in the world was found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It could live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Due to the slow growth rate, according to monitoring, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have necessarily lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult polar sharks from 28 females trapped by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493-centimetre and 502-centimetre Amazonian fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Since previous studies have shown that female ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are more than four metres old, the researchers calculated that they will be around 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fires nearly 300 employees – sellers will not be reduced
Nearly 300 employees will be made redundant from department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann says in its press release.
According to it, the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced so as not to suffer customer service.
In addition, about 80 support function employees will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann's co-determination negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of these operations, the need for redundancies was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The aim of the personnel reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to materialise next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann's difficulties in making department store sales profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, department store sales are still making losses.
Acting CEO of Stockmann According to CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
"Unfortunately, the personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says.
The profit improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter revenue and profit.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the corresponding period last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was EUR 4.1 million negative.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's revenue for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure centre over the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but it will be rainy further south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the mercury in the whole country remains below 20 degrees.
In rainy areas in the north, temperatures remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan track and field team rocked by doping scandal - strange explanation for coach's antics
Kenyan track and field coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah was posing as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to impersonate is 800m star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenya national team manager Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrahi's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home for "committing his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee president Kip Keino told Reuters news agency.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the consequences for the runner as a result of the incident are known.
Rotich finished fourth on the way to the World Championships last year and is one of the favourites to win in Rio in advance.
According to Reuters, a source inside Kenya's athletics team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for testing.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials for fear of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio Athletics Stadium buzzes with emptiness
Where is everyone?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
The battle for medals in athletics began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty stand.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of tickets for the first day of the morning races and 65 percent of tickets for the evening games have been sold.
It was different four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio as well.
The spectator divide at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands for rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-strong stands were full.
The poor sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling financially, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said at the weekend that 82 per cent of tickets had been sold at the time, a much lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given away 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even beach volleyball on the Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can redeem bearer rights to the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is divided virtually into parcels that those who wish to acquire the right of occupancy can receive in exchange for a fee.
The holder will have a veto right over his 187 square metre parcel, which in practice means that not every holder will have to give their approval if the land is to be repurposed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several parcels.
Acquiring possession is something concrete that can be inherited or given as a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Levikangas, who has acquired the right of possession for his company.
The person who has acquired the right of possession receives detailed location information from their block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website displays the names of those who have acquired bearer rights on the same map where the parcel information of the land area can be found.
Levikangas sees the only risk of his nature conservation procurement being that the foundation's operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act in some unethical or commercial manner, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Holder project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It is mainly financed by the sale of bearer rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and is planning to acquire land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in a pop-up forest at the Market Square in Helsinki on 13–19 August.
Bicycle thieves plague Turku the most of the big cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Of Finland's large cities, Turku is the most plagued by bicycle thieves.
More bikes have been stolen there this year relative to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Based on bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and bicycle parts stolen per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti came out on top.
According to police data, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
After all, that's a big difference.
"Some cities have twice as many thefts relative to the number of inhabitants as others," says Chief Superintendent Tommi Reen of the National Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I do not have an answer to that.
"The prevalence of thefts may be affected by how much people move around the city on bicycles and how many bikes there are in general," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top of the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a compact city centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts were recorded by the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
However, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, slightly more than 20,000 bicycle thefts are reported to the police every year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day, and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft to the police, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are solved.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases are also discovered in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in an apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught every week for the act itself or during a police investigation," says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from shopping centre bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, for example, practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopo is stolen the most of the individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large number of stolen bikes end up for sale online, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that stolen bikes go abroad very much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clearly low price," says Reen.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi always carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelter of the Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never taken, a good monk has been."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value either," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who had a quick visit to a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was huddled against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bike to something fixed, such as a bike rack.
"I think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a student from Helsinki says of his white bike, the frame of which alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You hear all the time from friends that bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, kind of ragged Jopos".
Valve itself had a bike stolen from the courtyard of the housing company a year ago.
However, the bike had been left unlocked, so Valve expected to steal it.
Will children under the age of 15 be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki experiments with peer-to-peer juries familiar from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with a so-called peer jury to prevent young people from falling into a spiral of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15, who are now deprived of criminal liability.
A peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a juvenile.
The idea is that a peer jury discusses what happened with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender himself can join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what lessons have been learned.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"Everyone guides the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury is modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person does not end up in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, service designer at service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
Especially the first offences committed by persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is run by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new operating methods are offered to everyone in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is directed to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be diverted to congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the divisions caused by Donald Trump, along with his recklessness, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring an avalanche of votes to Democrats in this election," the letter said, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-trimmed anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent out within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a prominent anti-Trump Republican.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials who worked on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am running for president so that the American economy is doing well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy is doing well for him and his cronies," Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand out to the American workers who are suffering as factories move to countries of cheap labour.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax refugee, it has to pay departure tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president], I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program announced Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this."
Clinton has previously called Trump's drastic cut in corporate taxes a "Trump loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized that she herself is the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton quipped.
These are Rio's viewership figures: The Games have not glued Finns to screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports competitions usually appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewership statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge viewership.
At best, 12 per cent of the population has been glued to the screens at one time: 615,000 spectators watched Tuesday night's swim on Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
So far, the most interesting Olympic sports have been cycling on Sunday evening and artistic gymnastics that opened the fifth day of competition, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sports at Yle Sports, is satisfied with the viewership figures and points out that, for the first time at the Rio Olympics, viewers will be divided into several different media.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with the proportion of TV viewers who choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you broadcast 24 hours a day, and you have between 20,000 and 500,000 viewers all that time, that's a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference – a large part of the Rio Games broadcasts in Finland are broadcast at night.
Another reason for the lukewarm interest - if anyone thinks it is lacklustre - is surely the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the preliminary Games, interest would have bounced upwards as a result.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial viewership has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, viewership figures explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the Games, which became the most downloaded free application in Finland on Apple's App Store during the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
My guess is that we're already around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the viewership figures until later," Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the defects have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other minor technical problems with the use of Rio Arena in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be broadcast on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Puhe broadcasts the races daily on the radio.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be watched on Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be broadcast both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Lake Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square metres in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which the dive computer showed to be 104 metres deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar.
The method may not find a small depression within a hundred metres," says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Lake Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction Aug. 12, 2:29 p.m.: Corrected the last paragraph where the deepest lakes with average depths were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax cuts: Taxation of pensioners still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still higher than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to light before the parliamentary elections, and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of wage earners.
The Government proposal does not include such a thing.
In our opinion, it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections," he tells Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received deductions from earned income, which reduced taxation.
The issue heated up opposition representatives in Parliament, who embers the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Conservative Party) about election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not increase
According to Ihalainen, the policy on tax cuts presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about safeguarding purchasing power, not increasing it, as wages will not be raised next year.
He says that a tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's insecurity.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Orpo about their willingness to respect the hard-won Competitiveness Pact.
He says sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be tarnished by questioning.
This is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment must be tackled in the government session
Ihalainen appeals to the Government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will slip.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No known Finnish casualties in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bomb attacks that took place in Thailand last night and last night Finnish time.
The Embassy advises Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
Finns' travel season to Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to Finns in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador speculates that the events may be related to political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, an ethno-national conflict related to the Muslim population is brewing, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist sites.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand over the course of a day after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded overnight on Phuket, a tourist destination popular among Finns, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no fatalities.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, wounding one person, according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
Both twin bombings killed at least one.
In addition, at least one bomb each exploded in the village of Surat Thani and Trang City in southern Thailand.
Both attacks killed at least one person.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it leads to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Koh Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of Thailand's ruling military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic further," he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators intended to destroy tourism in the country, as all the attacks have taken place in tourist areas.
The Embassy of Finland advises Finns in the country to be vigilant, avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the instructions of the embassy should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
Europeans in the wounded
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place overnight in Finland and their victims.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower, known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found one more bomb.
The Surat Thani bomb, according to the provincial governor, was hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quad
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with a score of 60.098 and Aliya Mustafina of Russia third with a performance of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for scaffolding titles at the Rio Games in the stall, jump and beam.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will for the past few years.
He has eight individual world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-stroke and stallion titles three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the year before.
With the U.S. team, Biles has won two world championships in team competition.
Biles has fainter World Cup medals in the jump and beam.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children's playclub in Phuket, Thailand, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think anything more miraculous will come of this, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen up close the many tragedies that have struck Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was bird flu and, last year, the bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these earlier ones haven't deterred tourists either, this is unlikely to be the case either.
Huovila's company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around nine o'clock local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put up for the Queen's birthday," Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
In Patong, the atmosphere was calm and shops on the main street were allowed to open around ten o'clock local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the attacks.
By half past three during the day Thai time, traffic in Patong had returned to normal and most shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small," says Huovila, who visited the scene of the attack.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the markings hiding in a nearby fir tree.
Another man was immediately apprehended.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police would like to thank those who provided tips.
Research Director on Leadership Changes in Russia: Clear Sidelining
Russia on Friday underwent its highest-ranking leadership change in years, with President Vladimir Putin firing his administration chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that rotating leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has clashed with other leaders or screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks related to environmental and transport issues.
In a tape aired by state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed persecution in his place, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high on Russia's agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been changed in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place that Putin changes his inner circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they withdrew in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were housed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters last week captured about 90 percent of the Islamic State-important city of Manbij.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected earlier story at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal," says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells BTI that public access to documents cannot be based on the authorities' own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in accounting records.
The Ministry's Director of Communications tells BTI that the ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time in the run-up to major competitions.
He injured his hamstring early in the season and had to miss the Olympic qualifiers for Jamaica.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's key," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and journalists turned fans.
The buzz around Bolt underscores that the Jamaican's star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and waning interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympics came in Athens 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200 m heats with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promising player, slowed down by injuries and a loose training stance.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a time of 9.69 in the hundred metres, where he smashed the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebrations.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career measured by the clock.
The Berlin-born world records of 9.58 hundred meters and 19.19 in two hundred meters still stand.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200m and a 19-second undercut, but none other than Bolt himself believes it will happen.
Satanen's toughest challenger to Bolt is Athens 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the World Cup final in Beijing, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in a major tournament final, if only he has made it.
In Daegu in 2011, Bolt missed the World Cup final due to a false start.
Bolt will be 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping violation
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping violation.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the EPO hormone.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 m butterfly in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspected doping cases have also come to light in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female steeplechase runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the EPO hormone.
Kenya, meanwhile, has sent an athletics coach from Rio home for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
Phelps is unstoppable - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States swam the 200-meter medley to his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal in the same discipline for the fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1:54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the medley ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read articles on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little buzz on social media or in the British press about her revealing and eccentric outfits.
After all, television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough revealing – at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there will be no backward steps.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just fun.
Skelton certainly wants to dazzle and maybe even startle, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead role.
It's not about me," he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is fine with me," Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss out of nowhere if it comes from (the presenter's) dress.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests on suspicion of terror
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security surveillance of the Games.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by the police back in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the extremist group ISIS.
The detainees had reportedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been circulated, for example, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers will be responsible for security at the Rio Games.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their preliminary round matches of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the venue to the public.
Police let the public in after detonating the package in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The public was allowed in after the police had detonated the package in a controlled manner.
The crowd was unable to reach the stands by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the arena.
The police blew up the package and only allowed the public into the hall after that.
The bang woke up the Spanish team, which started the competition sleepily.
Spain, who started the tournament with two defeats, defeated Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two Games, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Most recently, police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road cycling finish last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria kicked off their preliminary round matches of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian lady pushed Petäjä-Siren - Finn pondered protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren was hit Thursday.
Argentina's lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio in the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the foul.
He got stuck in the crash and the others ran away," said Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius.
For a long time, the athlete considered protest.
It was not worth doing because it would have been pointless under Olympic rules.
I would have had to fall into the water to get compensation," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on to his board until the last because he didn't want to end up in the dirty water of Rio.
Due to the crash, the Finn finished in 27th place.
In the overall standings, the London 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
In terms of tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day when there are races with starts 10-12.
Edited 0:39: Contrary to the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 peculiar things that, according to science, prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into a person's life.
Some things are habits that, directly or indirectly, affect a person's health so that their life is prolonged.
Other times, things that a person has no control over can bring them extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency towards central body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always even have to splurge – just picking up a carton of milk is enough.
Many different studies have been conducted to find out the secret of longevity.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially for neurological or heart-related diseases.
On the other hand, studies in favour of alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by more than six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, in turn, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway investigated how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment than those who laughed more.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
On top of that, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings extra years, there is no denying that.
However, achieving longevity does not require absolute fluidity.
A study from Oxford University found that women with big butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who won a medal at the Olympics or an Oscar-winning actor, he's more likely to live longer than the average chubby.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years into their life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status – which, in turn, makes it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over the age of 65 found that a person who shopped every day was more likely to be older than someone who shopped less often.
This is because spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
This, in turn, has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring death forward.
So put your credit card down - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver swerved into truck
A serious frontal collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koski in Southwest Finland on Friday evening.
The accident took place in Koski, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when an oncoming passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained upright in its lane but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into a ditch and then over the ditch onto its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The injured driver was removed from the car by the rescue department and transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breathalyser test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunken driving.
Posti sent loose candies to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the loose candy selection at K-Citymarket in Salo, because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was shopping for loose candies at K-Citymarket in Salo on Thursday when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose confectionery, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when Posti can deliver the load!
Unless you're busy mowing the lawn, the sign read.
The retailer's foxy sign is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
Lawn mowing will be available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
I was blown away by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this issue has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her own favourites in a loose candy bag, even though a few bins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti's Corporate Transport Services business, apologised to Ilta-Sanomat for the damage.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer started to make partial deliveries (to Salo) with three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
The matter was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not upset about the sign, because she found all her own loose candy favourites in the selection.

The comedian-producer has slimmed tens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of a life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of photos of her transformation on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness regimen and aimed to reach a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss career already in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and has gradually lost about thirty kilos.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of his stunning performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has garnered several praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We are on the same journey, motivation is high! one gloats.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I'm on the same trip," says another.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last kilos with the Let's do it now project.
At the time, she told Iltalehti that she wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then ten kilos away.
During the three-month exercise regimen, I eventually lost five kilos.
Family wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that instead of flowers and petitions, the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work.
The Sipoo Veterinary Clinic has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Clinic and also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor and not afraid of work.
Good friend.
We still cannot fully comprehend that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money will go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbours have told Iltalehti that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The murderer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the wages of an employee who refused to provide orientation to a leased employee, the Kanta-Häme District Court stated in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld wages and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the inductor's salary, which corresponded to the induction's share of the entire day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU on the prohibition of orientation.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti's employees will not provide orientation to leased employees who violate the strike.
The matter was first reported by People's News.
Turkey must return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development that respects human rights, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) in their reply to the Union of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
According to Sipilä and Soini, Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech to Turkey.
Putin dismissed the head of his administration - replaced by Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of Russia's Security Council, Interfax news agency reported.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his regime.
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's close-knit inner circle, will move on to special environmental and transport duties, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and suggested that Vaino be replaced by him, Russia Today reported.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his position in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition suspended - not seen in Premier League opener
The world record holder for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed with England.
Manchester United giant acquisition Paul Pogba will be sidelined due to suspension as ManU open their league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid €105 million for Pogba to Italian club Juventus, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) will keep him out of the game as Pogba was handed a ban from Juventus.
He received two cautions in last season's Italian Cup and will receive a one-match ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play for is in the second round of the league on August 19, when Man you face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue
Strict criteria for comfort and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival-goers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive attire.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area will be styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says the event's artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The success is based on a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves like to go to?
In event productions, it is quite unusual to think like this.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors from last year's 70,000 by 5,000.
This year, too, the festival will feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle controlled by huge avenues.
That is not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated so that the area, which is partly decorated with artificial grass, has 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant outlets and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a bit megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to keep the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even grand visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activities were highly dependent on support from the City of Helsinki of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can be used to accomplish "crazy things", such as building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own distinctive attire.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genus, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs of the tourist paradise of Thailand were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday evening, local time.
The attack killed at least one local woman and injured more than 20.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with the help of mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said, according to CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If your tweet isn't displaying properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets," Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which is also popular among Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack took place in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang city.
Police said they reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to Thai officials, the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been eager to tackle the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duty only several months after taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Chief of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible to fight in a war situation of conscripts serving for 5.5 months.
According to the Chief Training Officer, reservists belonging to the standby force will first be assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists will be assigned to a task for which the required training has not been provided," Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, the units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensation for mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth that was hazardous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The selling price had dropped to EUR 132,000, resulting in a financial loss of as much as EUR 198,000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the matter to court, where they demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The Court of Appeal handed down a verdict in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47,344 in the couple's legal and settlement costs.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already been aware of the need to repair the apartment to some extent when the housing transaction was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction defects that occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to start repairs.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition inspection report would not cause any harm.
The condition inspection report mentioned ventilation and insufficient control of rain and melt water running down the rock surface as risks and shortcomings.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this was a matter of any urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the impression that rainwater from the cliff should perhaps be controlled a little within a few years.
The transactions were closed in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial flora in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both rainwater from the rock and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, according to the inspector's assessment, microbial contaminated air could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mould or yeast that could pose a health risk and exceeded the limit values was found in smear samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay window and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit before the sale.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although the appropriate permits did not yet exist.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for extensive repair work in the near future, based on the information they had received from the seller before the sale.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to provide information, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Horrifying archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis – Finns also in the register
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland, USA, has recorded documents on microfilm about a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed bureau was subordinate to SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true to an even greater extent for women, who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological examinations were performed on the women to find out.
The Breed Bureau investigated women's backgrounds by, for example, examining church records.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
The women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and provide the breed agency with handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that the women were "child-loving", "frugal", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidizing the birth of children.
The Cross of Honor of a German mother was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the day at the Rio Olympics, but finished at the tail end of the group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth overall after five starts, but a failure in the second start dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for 17th and third places in the RS:X class day starts.
In the overall standings, Petäjä-Siren is in sixth place.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall standings, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so stuck"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finns' favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has risen from bartender on a cruise ship to Tango King of the Year in 1995, Finland's best-selling solo artist and star on dance stages and festivals, is still bubbling and is currently on a wild rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen and about the life of her favourite singer, was published today, Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about her life and career, for better or for worse.
Sillanpää's career took off completely when he won the Tango King's crown at the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but she had already planned slightly different music for herself back then.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at his request, which Kassu Halonen arranged into a slightly different form.
The song "Satulinna" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go quite according to plan: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had had a party that evening.
I was so stuck!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
From the recording of the song, which has become a huge hit, you wouldn't immediately guess that it was sung with a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the results were still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfection and excellence from yourself all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced her then-partner, and the case eventually ended up in the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics commissioned from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that she was making an album that tells a true story about her own life, but the lyrics of the song about the breakup were not true, but it was written based on a news article in 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper article stated that the reason for Jari and his ex-sweetheart's divorce was Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was complete nonsense and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company furiously and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of leaving and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls in polling week predicted the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged for resignation, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid", was scrapped in the Brexit vote in Britain.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics asks the profession for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists' loss of position in the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is taken away from a real Briton.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it will boost the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were struck by the BBC's fairness, which gave as much space to pro-Brexit economists representing only a couple of percent of the economists as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic grandiose combinations thought about the consequences of Brexit.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics in big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant overcrowds your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each café has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a Briton to get doctor's appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of a real Briton to get a place in school if they were got rid of?
Every municipality is home to foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they disappeared?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to answer them, and if they did, their answers did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, Britons have more jobs, fewer queues at health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in good time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the pro-EU camp, began to be prepared for in more detail a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was to leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have substantial liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We set out to increase our cash balances.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen said of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund was valued at £3.5 billion at the time.
In total, the company's funds are worth around £20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even less.
In other words, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went haywire.
In the real estate market, however, the less than two weeks following the vote were quite calm," Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, these smashed the situation and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008," Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors became nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and fund after fund was forced to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position due to the cash collected, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth withdrawing money now in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you are not forced to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because there would be losses.
This calmed the situation, and most withdrew the notification.
Since then, it has been fairly steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the continental funds in Aberdeen.
However, there were many inquiries.
Undue attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen's opinion, the closures of real estate fund transactions received an unreasonable amount of attention.
Open funds, which were affected by the closures, control around four per cent of UK properties.
The lockdown in Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold off fewer than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it may hold its funds closed into 2017.
At the moment, uncertainty is in the air and economic growth forecasts have been downwards, but the situation does not look "wilder" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its weakest level in 30 years, and the market is also selling off 15% compared to before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought minuses to London's property market
At two o'clock in the morning the situation did not look very good.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That was the expletive.
I realised that this is now going to plan B," says Vanhanen from his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive, despite the early hours of the morning.
TV screens in the office, which were normally set to silent, broadcast the news, and the usually noisy crowd fell completely silent listening as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display screens flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live," Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two property deals the day after the Brexit vote, Midsummer.
The atmosphere was mixed.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was calm in a way, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote started a correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into a change.
The markets began to anticipate drastic declines in the British and especially London property markets.
London office space was predicted to be negatively impacted by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began freezing their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it's far too early to say much about what the consequences of Brexit will be.
So much remains open: how the separation will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial data on developments in the London property market have already been received.
Real estate services company CBRE's data on price development cover about a third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3% between June and July.
In office buildings in the City of London, the negative figure was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have only been worse figures in five months," says Vanhanen.
All equally large drops occurred during the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started on the US property market.
In Vanhanen's opinion, the comparison is not quite apt, as this is now Britain's homespun crisis.
The mood is also different.
The real estate market has not seen panic selling like that at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity," Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
A correction could have been imminent anyway
In fact, a price correction is no wonder to him – it could have happened even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other world-leading cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that City, and especially offices, are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
Prices in London have climbed upwards for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to become globalised, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to seek income from new targets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available – although, according to Vanhanen, leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the rise in prices levelled off last summer," says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
Some kind of turnaround was expected, and now it came.
Where do we go from here?
It depends on how the British economy develops," Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to estimate much about the future, but says that there is unlikely to be an upward spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady pace ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the potholes can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If you have diversified, the risks are also diversified," Vanhanen says.
S Group starts registering shopping data more accurately than before
Soon, S Group will know what you're eating, as the retail group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information about the purchases of its loyal customers.
When information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start collecting it from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
S Group follows Kesko in this, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years now.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received on the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have prohibited the use of product information," Riitala tells Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in S Group's registration.
Kesko classifies its loyal customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for marketing targeted at the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty programme and there are no plans to do so at the moment.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty programme, which you can join at Valintatalo, Siwa and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group level data, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day, as well as the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not reached the level of K Group or S Group," says Anu Ora, Chief Commercial Officer.
According to him, the intention is to renew the customer loyalty program in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
To begin with, an experiment
SOK's co-op member and customer register has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address, basic data have also included occupation, education, type of residence, children's years of birth and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time, place, total amount of purchases and payment method are recorded for the S-Etukortti card purchase.
In addition, the data of S-bonus partners has been obtained from their POS systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been asking that marketing could be targeted more precisely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Co-op Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored at the checkouts anyway, whether you want it or not.
Interested parties can check their stored information on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasizes.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - puppy becomes first explosive dog
A black Labrador puppy vigorously sniffs five identical boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle drawer.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by playing with her favourite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar full of gunpowder gas shells.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell we have now practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila the dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in weapons and explosives search, and it will be assigned to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, the tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main place of work, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels prompted measures at Customs, and controls have been strengthened after the attacks," says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Officer at Customs.
Another main reason for training firearms and explosives dogs for Customs' duties is postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet sales, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including military equipment and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapon parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors among online purchases, passenger aircraft luggage and air freight at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research," says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more firearms and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila's puppy training is coordinated by the Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with experts from the police and the Finnish Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides which odours Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is trained further as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport include Customs' six sniffer dogs and Massi, a money and sniffer dog.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog selected for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and streams of people.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere at home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders are delivered to Heila from a one-time medication.
The cameraman of the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila immediately returns the protective cover, which looks like a soft toy, on the "off" order.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60,000–70,000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work takes only ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Customs faces fierce competition for the ownership of working dogs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to become Heila's owner.
Suntio was lucky, as he has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and control tasks at Customs.
The mini-state received its first Olympic medal - the nation gets a day off
Fiji, with a population of less than one million, holds the Olympic gold medal in rugby so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's public broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is taken the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilograms after a hard fight.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening quality as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos for the push and 145 kilos for the stunt.
His total was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push at the last 175 pounds, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by a wild roar.
Her body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian striker Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemin Palloseura, who play in the men's football league, have signed Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the remainder of the season.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has power and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
Together with more than ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, Prosa started to stand out from the crowd as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to accompany RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will face reigning Finnish champions SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The luscious 'Modern Family' star shrugs it off again: the teen star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as the kind Alex Dunphy in the sitcom Modern Family, makes another splash by showing off her luscious body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts exposed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and demeanor to a much bolder one.
The star has posed for pictures she posted on social media in very minimal clothing and got numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very skimpy outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently posted several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the image, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on TV almost her entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He's learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood," Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was just 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be ten years from now, when the downhill is already so hard," says one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look amazing!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, enthuses the young woman.
The Japanese prefer to come to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to entice Japanese people to start their Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
Northern Lights tours in Lapland in winter are in high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts in early autumn and continues well into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight doubly fairytale-like, says the acting director of Visit Finland. Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25–35 living in the city who dream of travelling and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights in Finland, and according to Lind, the Northern Lights have huge potential here.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown in Finland clearly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people in Finland spent 183 euros a day," Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fiji's masterclass leading to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's final challenge in Thursday night's final as they suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in handling, chewing, dodging, support play, running lines and sheer strength while winning gold – their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable consolation of a silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby kick-off tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 win over South Africa in the semi-final earlier that day may have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have beaten a team of 15 people in top form in this condition.
Great Britain can perhaps - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to the UK has been quite a one.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the tournament in Adelaide, coached by Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This spanking hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi got off to an excellent start, blocking Great Britain's tackles for fun.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was as if they were running towards moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the end zone in a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right wing resulted in a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was only a hindrance for Fidi.
At the seven-minute mark, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again from a fresh start with more than a minute left on the clock... first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou surged through Great Britain from loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the score was 29-0 going into the break.
It looked as if Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the way it is.
During the break, the UK made a raft of changes that blocked the dam in Fiji... for a full four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive passing game.
Dan Norton grabbed a goal for Great Britain when he scored a touchdown in the left corner to narrow the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fidi's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with his last-minute goal was the icing on Fidi's cake, which needed no frosting.
The whistle was blown, the Fidians hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final in which each scored one goal - Britain's goalkick decided the game.
Kyle Brown gave South Africa the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the end zone with dazzling footwork to score under the goalposts in the second half.
A spectacular late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15-sided rugby team, secured victory and eventually a silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer propelled Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There won't be more emotional gold at these Games, and that really means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard races into the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present throughout as the duo raced to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's pairs event - the first women in the history books of British sport to achieve such a feat.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with the grace of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind each rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as that of a coach who, after being diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it will spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate to be able to start his treatments in early 2014 outside of the season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
That encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it began.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first thing on the couple's mind was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and she had talked a little more than usual, trying to deal with her own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment on deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may perhaps be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been amazing.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so big thanks go to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their competitors couldn't match.
Even in the final 500m, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to get closer, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for good rowing and winning the race, and we did.
The couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.
Iceland replaces government plagued by Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks demanded as early as spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised at the time to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the nation's outrage last spring will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the presidential elections in June, criticism of those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran as a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest controversial speeches.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that incumbent President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in founding the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the remarks and demanded an apology from Trump.
Anyone who can sink so low should never be allowed to become commander-in-chief of the military," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of the Muslim burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not wear a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandiosely expresses religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the extremist group ISIS attacked a church in northern France, killing an 80-year-old priest.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - blue-green algae clouding in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi has blue-green algae turbidity been observed.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus bacteria of intestinal origin in bathing waters at all beaches were below the action levels set in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcus concentrations in the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae turbidity observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, in which case a blue-green algae mass forms on the water surface in the form of rafts.
The Environment Department is monitoring the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae turbidity turns into a blue-green algae bloom, the matter will also be announced separately on the notice board at the beach.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen on forest gift deduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of gift tax on generational change of a forest holding.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the forest gift deduction has four objectives: to promote generational renewal of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure capital income from forestry.
In general, the idea of creating a tool like this to promote generational renewal of forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax amendment proposal.
It is proposed that the deduction for forest gifts be made from the forest owner's pure capital income.
It is income from capital minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal is based on the assumption that by deducting pure capital income from forestry, it will prevent it from causing losses on capital income from forestry that would be deductible in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell the wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it," Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
In the proposal, the tax deduction limit tied to the yield value of forests is EUR 40,000.
In Hakkarainen's opinion, it has been drawn too high.
As such, he says, it will remove 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of forest owners," he says.
The Ministry of Finance considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of farms.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been pushed for decades in forest policy.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hail storm surprised motorists in Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a strange rear-end collision at Himanka in Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars driving in succession swerved into a ditch, after which the person behind collided with the rear of the driver in front.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the on-duty fire marshal, the derailment is suspected to have been caused by heavy hail.
There were two people in the car behind him, both of whom were transported to hospital for treatment.
There is no further information about their injuries.
The driver of the car in front was not injured.
The accident took place on highway 8 from Himanga towards Kalajoki.
Finnish study may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results by researchers at the University of Turku may help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The observations made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumour increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
The threshing of the Muhos family home murder continues in court, the prosecutor is also demanding a murder conviction for another perpetrator
The threshing of the Muhos family home murder continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home murder in Muhos.
The other received 8 years 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery committed as a young person, among other charges.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and driving a vehicle without a licence as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is asking for a man with a lighter sentence to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
Were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as an instructor in the school's child welfare unit in July last year.
According to the grounds for the conviction, the 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked the director sitting on the sofa in the living room from behind.
The instructor had released his grip and led the youth to his room, at which point one of the youths hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled, punched and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind study, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to escape from the family home at least the day before.
The polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, reproduces only at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark or holler can live up to 400 years.
The female reproduces only at the age of 156 years.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of mussel is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers were able to find out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in one direction or another can be as much as 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic sage - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't change the world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenue would be lost if the corporate tax change advocated by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially through tax breaks for the benefit of the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A truly staggering sum of USD 1 000 billion a year would not be raised.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, 33 after Trump's proposed cut.
Inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
Hastily decided environmental standards must be reformed and the energy sector deregulated.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be reconsidered.
The administration must appoint 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
"Destructive" trade policies are one of the main causes of U.S. problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and a penalty tax of 35% from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America Doesn't Change the World Need:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to his custom, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by aides, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists — including those close to Republicans — see Trump's program as plunging the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday Finnish time.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is turbulent fatally, but a veritable tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a satirical comedy with a funny and cheeky side, followed by Iho in which I live (2011), one of the peaks of the Spanish virtuoso's career.
On a level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen largely as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on its way for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She starts with the time before her daughter was born, the moments she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the other female lead will be Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, from the TV series Time Between Stitches (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered clumsy, but I would say quite cunning and literally with a single swipe.
There is a fair distance between Julieta and the flashiness that is often so characteristic of Almodóvar films, right down to the humour.
It is an equally strongly acted, subdued, sometimes with good music and quite melancholy, which, as such, has elements of elegy.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director remains, and in such a way that it gradually begins to stand out more as a pure form than as a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are plagued by illness, death, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true for the costumes: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same goes for the showy ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tuning of the scene in question, does not particularly improve from this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a bit breathless.
Almodóvar wrote the screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian author Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat even-handed literary film.
There would have been ingredients for an emotionally incomparably more robust drama, such big issues – especially gnawing guilt – the film's theme deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government tries election gimmick - People's News
There will be no further cuts, say the ministers, so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are being made in droves.
There will be no new cuts.
The savings of four billion that have already been decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Conservative Party) affirm before the budget session.
This is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry of Finance's proposal, because cuts in social security were already decided in the government discussion on spending limits in the spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be shortened from 500 days to 400.
Education cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why are ministers so keen to emphasise precisely that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the electoral period, not polls.
It has been seen before that municipal election results that take the government parties in different directions spoil the mood of the government for a long time.
However, polls indicate that the governing party, the Finns Party, is facing a landslide defeat, even though its result in the previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party gained 752 new councillors, most of whom will realise the price of influencing the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three roughly equal parties depends on the Finns Party holding up.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of fermentation in the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
The rhetoric of "there will be no new cuts" firstly obscures the fact that they will be drastic next year and, secondly, tries to soften the blow that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if Sipilä's government is still in place.
The Government has set itself the goal of levelling off debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal proposes that EUR 5.9 billion of debt will be taken out next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already halfway through the parliamentary term and admit that the government will not be able to follow its own programme: the accumulation of debt will not subside or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means new, even tougher cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018, and then what comes will be received in the parliamentary elections in the spring.
With these measures, indebtedness will not be curbed
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be curbed, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget press conference prove this irrefutably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no pull from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has risen by 35% this decade and has lasted from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros more per year than in 2008.
According to the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent mark in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt stimulus proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, maintaining unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will in practice be covered entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Municipalities want to be left with a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that organising child day care, youth work and sports are the responsibility of municipalities, according to a study by KAKS - Foundation for Municipal Sector Development.
A clear majority of the population also shifts responsibility for libraries, culture, community colleges, building supervision, upper secondary education and waste management onto individual municipalities.
The counties, on the other hand, are most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised health care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks that municipalities are responsible for public order to the state.
Underage drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie in Joensuu on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle, which was riding without lights, but the young man started to run away from the police and was speeding.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrannantie, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test performed on the driver showed 0.75 per mille.
Nor did he have a driving licence entitling him to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stones overturned into a ditch
A truck loaded with stones overturned into a ditch on Kaavintie in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 9.15 pm.
The truck had drifted off the road in a left-hand curve and rolled over on its side in a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through a door left overhead, together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
Hydraulic oil spilled onto the road from the overturned truck, which was absorbed into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in Ilmajoki in the afternoon
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki's Lahdenkylä district in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a slim and upright woman, about 165 centimetres tall, with white under-chin hair.
For observations and clues about the movements of the missing person, please call the tip number of the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre 0295440513.
Elements of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest devastation
The downpour that toppled the tents of the Parafest festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get back on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The downpour is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
Changes in the state of water in a thundercloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools down and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there will be several downdrafts in Finland during the summer.
The path of downdrafts is difficult to predict.
The downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five o'clock.
Three tents toppled over, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners age their skin faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, say, that of their peers living in rural areas.
Skin-ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's research found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk to work near crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but regular cleansing of the skin is recommended as a more practical solution.
The brakes of the tractor failed - pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks around his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor pushed the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to slide further, as it collided with rocks in front.
Rushing with new strength for the upcoming season
Joensuu-based Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Finnish Volleyball Championship League, will start the series starting in October from a better starting point than in living memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks now.
The common ground will certainly be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Riento.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Riento's head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Of the foreign trio, centre-back Fred Musoni will start his second season at Riento.
The new faces are 23-year-olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who has featured for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-centimetre chipper.
Garchet is similarly a passer, the Brazilian measures 198 centimetres.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipojat to the USA national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth Games are already going on in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working and playing in Turku with the women there when I saw the ad.
The USA was one of the founders of the national floorball team.
I became interested and here we are," says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, floorball was not yet played at the Finnish Championship level.
Floorball was played at university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in the Finnish Championship in Jokipojat, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish floorball league for the university club during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
While playing, she coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Her career in the Finnish Women's Championship culminated in a silver medal in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish Women's Championship, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The last Finnish Championship season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to the national team
Joensuu-based floorball club Josba was brought up by Perttu Puska and Eno-based Tatu Väänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the EFT tournament in Brno, Czech Republic on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who plays in the Helsinki Erä team, has previously played six men's international matches with a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss side Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a thigh problem and is a regular in the national team with 117 caps of experience.
Veteran Seinäjoki Peliveljet player Mika Kohonen was also named to the national team, and he was last seen in a Finland shirt at last December's World Championships.
The head coach of the floorball national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball champion Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold missing from trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is retiring as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth categories.
Organised in cooperation between Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the top six pairs in each category's ranking qualify for the Finnish Championship final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäki YMCA-bred Essi Hasu, who has been one of Finland's beach volleyball greats for several years.
Now living in Helsinki, Hasu is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully, as many people as possible will be able to attend the stands this weekend.
There will certainly be a great arena at the Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark for sports and provided a good basis for a great hobby.
There are good memories of childhood in the mind.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in the E-girls of the Elimäki YMCA.
At the top of my mind is a jersey that is too big, knee pads rolling around at the ankles, and amazing ace shouts and choreographies after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved in the activities - our teammate's father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice as a substitute for indoor volleyball.
Curve Pond beach has been playing beats since the 1990s.
Käyski has always been active.
I also went to watch the Finnish Junior Tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the Finnish Championship finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
The Finnish Championship gold is still missing from the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be Hasu's last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, my international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
In any case, flip-flops will be nailed, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A downpour toppled tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was imminent
A downpour knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for people with disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a performance going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-duty fire chief interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
Salomon Koli, 25, a young farmer, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Almost two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started operating as a successor to their homestead.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of farms so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always liked to work on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
However, I myself really bravely got involved in the project and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Koli, who raises beef cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer competition of Maaseudun Tulevaisuus magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria stood at 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, as measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase was observed in the prices of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained on level with the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's 'anime' effect criticized as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that would fit into a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are simple, face-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app promotes a blackface mask or favors bleached skin tone as a beauty ideal.
So while Snapchat touted a lens for some users this week that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people — a "yellowface," aka yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated controversies could signal the company's bigger problem with diversity.
The news and outcry went viral Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had shut down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied anime comparisons.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
He added that "it's hard to argue with a comparison of outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects side by side."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellowface, but a yellowface taken to extreme degrading.
Snapchat isn't the only company going beyond these cultural trap threads.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image for a user, "it's much harder for these guys to be discreet."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an op-ed for Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believes the racial controversy reflects Snapchat's lack of diversity in hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male management and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PoistaSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make these kinds of decisions," Zhu, a Sino-American, said, "or they have people of different skin colors at work, but they're not in positions where they feel safe or can speak up."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a representative said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and move forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say this is not okay."
Congressional panel finds military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials from the U.S. military's military zone headquarters had modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground warranted.
The interim report of the task force set up by the Republican chairman of the House Defense Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among intelligence analysts at headquarters who said superiors tampered with their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the Armed Forces War Area Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom executives typically painted a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than warranted by facts on the ground. They were consistently more positive than the analyses produced by other contributors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable — our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking policymakers," Representative Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
The failures of Centcom's management reach all the way to the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it doesn't provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be rigged, it portrays analysts as feeling pressured by Centcom executives to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Headquarters press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still held by ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, highest-ranking intelligence directors at U.S. Armed Forces War Zone Headquarters manipulated headquarters intelligence outputs to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, released Thursday, follows more extensive findings while the investigation is ongoing.
The Inspector General of the Department of Defense has opened an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were consistent with the concluding observations of some of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment by ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's lead democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the release of intelligence outputs," worsened sentiment among analysts, and "left enough room for divergent points of view."
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into a "pre-set or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary findings of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commanding Capt. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But, he said, "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues."
The investigation has more repercussions than just the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials are now claiming).
Last year's accusations called into question how much President Obama can trust headquarters to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence mirrors a controversy more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering what the consequences of a 2003 invasion would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to officials last year, Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers viewed his testimony to the Senate as an overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, staging a showdown with Britain
A day after scoring three goals in the team's 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable feat, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But here's what he knows: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share first place in their group with Britain, who were still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarter-finals and this game will determine who finishes first and who finishes second in their six-team group.
The first place finishers avoid the strong Holland, the leader of the second group, for a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have caused a stir with their surprising success here, four years after finishing last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport for Drexel), joining the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not make it to the final roster.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the pace of work in London that we have now.
We have done a U-turn.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a knuckle punch from close range.
India had come into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score at 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took control.
He carried the ball long down the left side of the court, then circled into the middle and yanked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
This shutout was the tournament's first for U.S. goalie Jackie Briggs, who had conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
He is in good form.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace in the midst of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a furious message of competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It's impossible to turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to a conversation with someone next to you in line at a café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic first-timer and future heartthrob with his smile pits, could well be one of those well-known names presented in prime time, backed by sponsorship deals and feel-good TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all sports equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a fair number of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it first debuted at the Sydney Games, its presence has received so little attention in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn't realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
However, there is a certain underdog charm associated with the trampoline, partly because to the unsophisticated ear it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, I am just a flightless fan.
The sport has the potential for amusement, as can be seen from the vibrations of the endless bounces in cartoons, but it also has the gracefulness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that basically combine in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
Championship seekers jump on a giant trampoline up to nearly 30 feet high and must perform spinning sequences of movements (turns, folds and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official program of the Olympic Games, they are judged by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those hoping for a medal have to go further, faster, up and over in search of gold - sometimes all the way to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised coverage, for another mocking border: a world or Olympic record.
This purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even bring the viewer to tears.
But it's also the reason why watching the races can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor soars to a new ascent, appearing weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this is not lacking in competition and difficulty, but during the program there is no furious rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, just a dreamlike, graceful interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as can be achieved at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon with the broadcast starting at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's races will also come on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon programming, starting at 2 p.m. both days.
Amidst the Olympic frenzy, they offer a quiet, charming moment that probably won't go unnoticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting to sigh at his new fan base.
'Generation demonstrates' in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the U.S.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia crumbling?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a firm ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos that have circulated, recorded at the protests, believed to be late last year or early this year, show security officials beating young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more so in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries value its stability.
America's military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved immensely, and there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
City streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy. Human rights organisations have constantly spoken of government repression, opposition in the country has been limited, and dissent has been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this is what will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said.
All young people are demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are manifold and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's much-criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now holds all the seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are rising. The battle along this tense and disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil beneath the surface, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through online proxies that hide their location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for the demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amhara, get along better.
The Oromo and Amharic are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are heading towards organizing under one umbrella," Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromo think that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by Tigre people. The nation covers about six percent of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified at observing early signs of discontent and using secret envoys to neutralize opponents.
"The current regime doesn't have that kind of basic instinct," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he is not trusted by Tigrayan-controlled security services.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested about elections which, according to analysts, looked like the government first shook and then plundered them.
In the ensuing crackdown, many demonstrators were killed, albeit fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian Government within the country.
And now it is beginning to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigrayan-owned businesses, and anti-Tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump explains Obama-based-ISIS claim as 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to quell the controversy that gripped his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn't serious when he insisted numerous times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in an awkward position where they have to explain remarks he doesn't necessarily mean.
After the insinuation at Wednesday night's campaign rally, Trump claimed the same with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that he really meant to say that President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was an about-face from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate listened to him.
The latest storm of criticism comes at a time when Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll results.
Trump and Clinton battled while speaking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the topic.
Fleeing again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense in the past.
Late in July, after facing widespread criticism for seemingly suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain posts that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's cunning about his statements and knows they're vague enough to be filtered through multiple lenses.
Instead of toning down his rhetoric for the general public, Trump has been even more sassy in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump lags far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces increasing scrutiny over the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the nominee in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to take to Twitter to attack news media that grind at his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television pundits who try to find out about him, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's excuse as new evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue became too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of a cupcake.
Locals lamented it as the latest loss in a city being renovated into a middle-class state.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is about change, it's also about reinventing.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unrefined atmosphere.
The coffee is still good, too.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a client offered to fund her at the new location, she said she was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same supplier of bagels and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, toppings such as capers and browned onions.
In bowls there is brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but makes fresh juices.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the café.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he's back to coffee, although that day he ordered a blended chai drink instead of his regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always placed the same order.
"Every day from fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I would go in and they would be making my spicy bagel with butter," she said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still places his usual order, but sometimes, for variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he holds no grudges against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
in fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would use cold brewed coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also approved the café.
One of those new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said she plans to display it somewhere soon to make her new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juice shop likes to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough for them to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was desolate when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home as he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I had longed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: The Depression's Paralyzing Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes like foie gras pâté and Maryland marsh turtle soup.
That day, her diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a culinary act of solidarity with the people who are suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper releases Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they meet a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a portion with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple saw fit to discuss eating during the Depression.
"Loafers were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they make up your dinner.
Coe grimaced.
"It must have felt lead-heavy in my stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, Americans' tables, especially in rural areas, were like an eat-as-much-as-you-can buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which a nation coped with suddenly no longer being a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes like loafs and casseroles became the main dishes, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Peculiar combinations were tried, with calorie intake and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also doing research for a book of recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of the era in which fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman elaborated, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Household Affairs from 1923 to 1943, guided the nation's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and rise to the challenge of transforming lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the accounts of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowa country food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in the nearly gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was awesomely out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not encouraged him to set an example on her own stomach.
As the book recounts, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "served not only one of the bleakest in Washington, but also the most miserably prepared food."
Many of the Depression-era eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she couldn't throw food away.
"He really was afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum mousse," Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a flashy name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons in the sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sants once and twice.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead to reimbursement of attorney's fees in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to attorneys' fees incurred in its hepatitis C litigation against drug manufacturer Merck &; Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvon. This acquittal followed a U.S. judge finding Merck's misconduct, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a ruling filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be released from the damages it suffered in opposing the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over ownership of the lab work underlying Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely captured ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely captured the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had freed more than 2,000 wing hostages held captive by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's allied group, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"We now have full control of the city, but we have started to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaker fees, and the former secretary of state announced that he received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for a book detailing his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10-year tax returns.
Their effective federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and reneging on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though there is no legal obligation to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited the IRS audit as the reason for refusing to release their tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special aide, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his charitable donations, his business dealings, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the audience.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax in the two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants who said the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, has an ongoing IRS audit, and that Trump is "not afraid" of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, had an effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's tax return from 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers boost elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from migrating into human settlements — they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, together with the US-based Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without injuring the animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Ever since we developed... tools, we have observed a change in attitudes in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide, said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing a piercing elephant with a flashlight and honking the horn.
If it does not hinder the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and a firecracker, after which the condom is screwed on so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
One snort is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
As a last resort, there is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. Fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab request
The French, Jewish-born filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the documentary film Shoah about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter in the German publication FAZ.
During a recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of country codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the states that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker raised the issue at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response received from there "shocked him."
The hotel's recipe manager said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more consternation in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded the removal of Israel's area code," the employee is quoted as saying, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a "great injustice," the Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But an even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident generated quite a backlash online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "gave in" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another publication, which pointed out that the hotel, located on the magnificent Kurfürstendamm Street, stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges, calling the incident "inattention" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel on the shortcut list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman is quoted as saying, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest against government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse the crowd of students, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals of Paulo Geraldo Alckmini, the governor of the state of Sao Paolo, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of those taking part in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest rally came just days after protesters rallied en masse in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted on her impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran surges by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, turnover in trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Levan Dzhagaryan, Russia's ambassador to Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown interest in doing business in the country in large numbers, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, turnover from trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totaling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent to a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
"The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative Office in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the top 20 countries with the most tourists for the first time.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner surged to the finish line as the British clinched cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night as the trio of the British team defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in a role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, a legend proud of the youngster as he raced to the finish line to snatch victory over pre-season favourites New Zealand.
Britain pulled off a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won her fifth of six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at the March World Track Championships in London, although Hoy has since ended his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of special dispatcher Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kia's Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held on to, seeing the potential in the Scot that has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny — who won the title with Hoy four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead and Skinner held on to it.
The change in strategy was a big part of the makeover, and involved driving Hindes into a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed suit from his position as BBC pundit and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, said: "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted his comments and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like being in London with so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We've lost so many World Cups, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects developments over the last five months, a successful five days await us at the cycling stadium.
Judging by the form Kenny has shown, it's not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny's – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that seemingly holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – would see his total medal total rise to six golds and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It is won together with the guys.
Winning alone is honestly lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be knighted."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were fastest in qualifying in the four-man, four-kilometer team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had an argument with the referees yesterday before qualifying when officers called him up for a length measurement.
In a similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in a world record time with the clock stopping at 4:13:260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on its mighty track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
After showing truly extraordinary and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, not the least of which has been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the racing careers of great figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect moment could once again hold true.
Portland smelter's future questionable due to electricity contract cut
The future of Portland's Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain after the electricity company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant's owners is about to terminate the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows a decision by the Victoria government earlier this year not to extend the subsidies required to keep the plant running.
The subsidy for a specified period of 20 years ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which started as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, with Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp owning smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter's physical demand for electricity will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "hedging agreements" that were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to pay off in fiscal year 2017," the utility company said.
All potential profit impacts for AGL from financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already "in anticipation of expiration" reduced the value of contracts in its books by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa... the ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the smelter's electricity supply'.
The US company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November this year, but has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, given the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, Stephen Mikkelsen, executive director of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants exit the market, it will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashians' reality TV star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and modeled at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover announcement was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and which involved everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about their sister's cover, but ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the clichéd plot of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest utters "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning cartoon bunny jockey), but Kris had to get her other girls to somehow benefit from this publicity.
That's because we've certainly entered a new era of the Kardashians with a spot in Vogue in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling edition of the entire year.
Its thickness is more reminiscent of a coffee book than a fashion magazine, and the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus were promotional content).
The reveal of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images from the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years, there have been more "celebrities who act as models" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, described by the magazine as a "success model" of her generation, fell into the first category, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren't relatives of famous people or reality stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of that).
They are rightfully talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be precarious.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bastards of the moment."
That sentiment resurfaced with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But spinning in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
She is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She is a model for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalled apps.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Every year, 160 000 people are turned away by Community legal centres
More than 160 000 nations are turned away from the Community's judicial centres every year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, which have already been stretched to the limits of the Community, are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need each year," he said.
People leaving abusive relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly fired employees — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need with their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities, and Mrs Palaszczuk's government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while they were driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordini Wednesday in state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before realizing that "it wasn't going to happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other individuals had had similar experiences with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage when he told an audience in North Carolina that "people in the Second Amendment" — which usually includes gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if her rival, Hillary Clinton, were elected and allowed to choose justices.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's suit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, local news affiliate Charlotessa, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A callback request from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings revitalization and flourishing across the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions benefited from it.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we are doing so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created in local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the London 2012 Games, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be ashamed before the world.
The sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs and €211 billion. pound economic growth, as well as leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has raised €11 billion. The pound's infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget: from T5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to build a third runway, supported by €16 billion. pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time we channelled the spirit of the Olympics and expanded Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Trade Secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a game of cat and mouse about blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-blocking programs are a "game of cat and mouse," said one of the companies that make such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying users could update the program's filters to once again block ads on the social network's pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the code on its website would be changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the open-source ad blocking community and its circumventors has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it's possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much of a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
With 1.03 million active daily users, Facebook uses mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is trailing behind ad blockers for desktop pages, as mobile ad blockers don't work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue for Facebook to consider this kind of action worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it was updating its "ad preference" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were troubling because they would also block some of the site's non-promotional content.
"This is not a good experience for people and we have plans to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are tedious tools, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appeared to be a suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on the road, where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's up to the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases — both of which involved a person walking in the dark on a highway — it was assessed that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter for negligence after hitting and killing a man lying on the A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police officer who was responding to the emergency call was driving in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was a "completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Habitable
According to estimates of NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, could ever have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow speed of rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably drier areas of the planet than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid evaporation of water.
Early Venus also had the advantage of having a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation reveals its daytime side to the Sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average global temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current levels.
The model produced a story about Venus' evolution similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned under ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy steps down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy on Thursday resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey, citing a lack of influence over the team's decision-making process as the reason.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the information, mentioning that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president of hockey affairs and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I've thought long and hard about how I can improve this team to give them the depth they need and take them to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey affairs must be fully aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked out Colorado in the first round of the playoffs and the team hasn't qualified for the past two years.
The Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing the Western Conference wild card playoff spot.
Hall of Fame inductee Roy won four Stanley Cups — two with both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
North Sea oil workers' industrial action over pay will be postponed as all sides in the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been held sporadically on North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, in order to take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions say their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractor fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee deduction follows a 10 per cent reduction for contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said further cuts would give the company the leeway it needs to survive the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as the company streamlines operations following its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labour disputes in a generation.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to receive less than $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete inventory of the rotational velocities of stars in the Pleiades Cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a press release
The Pleiades Cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their peak level.
At their peak rotational speeds, these maturing stars spew large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of stellar rotational velocities suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with the bigger ones doing pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades Cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing stellar properties at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades cluster provides anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed and, so to speak, hang up their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Pleiades in three papers to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
