According to the organizers of the demonstration, about 100,000 people turned up in such German cities as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
Police estimated there were 6,500 demonstrators in Berlin.
There were also demonstrations in Paris, Sofia, Vilnius, Valletta, Tallinn, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, around 200 people demonstrated outside the premises of some of the companies that control copyright to a large extent.
Last month, there were large protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which led to the Polish Government deciding not to approve the agreement until further notice.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed accession to ACTA.
Animal rights organisations Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) have again called for the installation of CCTV cameras to be mandatory in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that controls and inspections of slaughterhouses should be normal in Australia.
The use of surveillance cameras would certainly send a clear signal to people working with animals that animal welfare is a priority.
The U.S. Geological Survey International Earthquake Map showed no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Meteorological Agency has also not reported any earthquakes in the Hekla area for the past two days.
The significant seismic activity that led to the change of phase had been experienced on 10 March on the northeast side of the volcano's peak crater.
Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported from the foot of the mountain.
The clouds may have caused confusion as to whether the eruption had occurred after all.
Luno had between 120 and 160 cubic metres of fuel when its engine broke down and strong winds and waves pushed it towards the breakwater.
All twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters, with the only injury being a broken nose.
The hundred-metre-long vessel was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertiliser, and at first the authorities feared that the load might leak from the ship.
The proposed amendment has already passed both houses of Congress in 2011.
The amendment was made at this legislative session. The second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives, then passed the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
Since the second sentence aimed at preventing same-sex civil marriage was rejected, the door may well be ajar for the acceptance of civil marriages in the future.
At the end of the discussion, HJR-3 will be re-evaluated in the next post-election legislative period either in 2015 or 2016 in order to keep it on the table.
In addition to directing, Vautier's achievements included the 1973 hunger strike against censorship he considered political.
French legislation was amended. She began activism at the age of 15 when she joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in his 1998 book.
In the 1960s, he headed back to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who has won two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was determined to be intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
At the time of his death, Saito was not only a former Olympic and world champion, but also chairman of the Japan Judo Federation's training committee.
At least a hundred people had attended the party to celebrate the couple's first wedding anniversary last year.
The official wedding anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, according to authorities.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
Buffalo-born 30-year-old husband was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who has taught at Modern Education and King's Glory prep schools. According to his own claim, he had 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
He used words in his markings that some parents thought were crude, and reportedly he used expletives in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing big ads on buses without permission and of lying when he claimed to be the head English language instructor.
He has also been charged with copyright infringement in the past, but was not formally prosecuted.
The former student said she "used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like a friend of students."
Over the past 30 years, China has developed a market economy, although officially the country is still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90-fold.
Last year, China exported more cars than Germany for the first time, overtaking the United States as the largest market in the industry.
Within two decades, China's GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
Tropical Cyclone Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
Located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, the storm has a maximum sustained wind strength of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center have predicted that by Wednesday, Danielle will have strengthened into a hurricane.
Because the storm is far from the coast, its potential impact on the United States or islands in the Caribbean Sea remains difficult to assess.
Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek gained fame playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined the club in 1945 and remained with the club until 1958.
During his team years, he played in 468 matches and scored 403 goals.
No one has played in more Partizan matches or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995, he became the best player in the history of Partizan.
The festivities began with a special screening by the world-famous Cirque du Soleil troupe.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janissary Orchestra and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
After that, spinning dervishes took the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance company Anatolian Fire performed their Troy show.
13-year-old motorcycle racer Peter Lenz has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis circuit.
Lenz, who was on the warm-up lap, fell off his bike and was then hit by rival Xavier Zayat.
The track's medical personnel immediately began treating him, and he was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero went on to say the following about the global economy: "The financial system is part of the economy, an essential part.
We have suffered from a year-long financial crisis, the most acute moment of which occurred in the last two months, and I believe that the financial markets are now starting to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced plans to significantly increase its international and multilingual news operations with three new broadcasts.
News is already available in English and Japanese, but the global company will start producing Spanish, Italian and Korean programmes for television, web and mobile devices.
Luckily nothing happened to me, but the sight was macabre as people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit window panes with chairs, but the glass was unbreakable.
Eventually, one of the screens broke, and people started getting out through the window," crash survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat because energy is generated when hydrogen atoms combine (i.e. fuse) with each other to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to develop a reactor that would be able to produce energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve and it will be many years before usable fusion reactors are built.
The steel needle floats on water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface of the water attract each other much more than air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible film on the surface of the water, thanks to which, for example, a needle is able to float on water.
In a way, the blade of modern skates has two blades with a concave groove between them. Thanks to the two blades, you get better grip on the ice even when tilting the skate.
Since the lower part of the blade curves slightly, the edge that hits the ice also curves when the blade tilts to either side.
Because of it, the skater turns. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
To go back to their previous energy level, they need to get rid of the excess energy they received from light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Scientists refer to this process as stimulated radiation emission because bright light stimulates atoms and causes photon emission of light, and light is also a type of radiation.
The following figure shows how photons are emitted from atoms. In reality, of course, photons are much smaller than in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament of the light bulb finally burns out, and the lamp no longer works.
Then the lamp needs to be replaced. Care must be taken when replacing the lamp.
First of all, the switch on the luminaire must be switched off or the cord disconnected.
This is because the electricity flowing into the chuck to which the metal part of the lamp is attached can cause a serious electric shock if you touch the chuck from the inside or the metal base of the lamp while it is still partially attached to the chuck.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood leaves the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratops would have been able to crush not only leaves, but even very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cone palms, which were common plants in the Cretaceous period.
They look like small palm trees with a crown formed by sharp, prickly leaves.
Triceratops could have used their powerful beak to tear off the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that no dinosaurs likely ate these plants because they are very poisonous. Yet even today, sloths and some other animals, such as parrots (descendants of dinosaurs), are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would Io's attraction affect me? If you stood on Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A human weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) in Io. So, of course, attraction pulls you down less.
Unlike Earth, the Sun has no shell to stand on. The whole sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas thins as it moves further away from the centre of the Sun.
The outermost part of the Sun that we observe is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and discovered that Venus has phases just like the Moon.
The phases occur because only the side facing the Sun of Venus receives light (the same applies to the Moon). The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks discovered the transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after Danelagen had been reconquered.
However, in 991, Ethelred was confronted by a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Norwegian Olavi Tryggvenpoika with the aim of liberating Norway back from Danish domination.
After the first military setbacks, Ethelred managed to reconcile with Olav, who returned to Norway to try to win back his empire, with varying degrees of success.
Hangul is the only specially developed alphabet that is in common daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418–1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and one of the most revered.
He originally named the Hangul alphabet hunmin jeongeum, which means "correct sounds for the teaching of the people."
Several different theories have been put forward about Sanskrit ancestry. One of them concerns the Aryans, who brought their language with them while wandering from the West to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the gathering of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as a source for many modern languages in India, in the same way that Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing to attack the British Isles.
Germany codenamed the attack Operation Sea Lion. Most of the British Army's heavy armament and equipment had been lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk, so the Army was rather weak.
Still, the British Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few British naval ship bases were located near likely attack routes, as the admirals feared they would sink in a German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
Italy's land and naval forces were weaker, although it had recently built four new ships just before the start of the war.
Italy's main objectives were African countries. To conquer them, it needed a springboard for its troops to cross the Mediterranean by ship and invade Africa.
For that reason, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything else besides that.
Then Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to move underwater and stay there for long periods of time.
Submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars. At that time, they were very slow, and their weapon range was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but as radars began to develop and became more accurate, submarines were forced to move underwater to remain invisible.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans knew how to sail and operate their submarines very skillfully.
Because the Germans used submarines so successfully in the war, not many submarines are trusted to them after that.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as King Tut or Boy King, is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in antiquity and was not added to most ancient lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him famous. Many of the tombs of the past had been looted, but this tomb had remained virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved and include thousands of objects made of precious metals and precious stones.
The invention of the bobbin wheels made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to defeat soldiers and second chariots in speed.
The arrows of the deadly crossbows of the Assyrians were able to pierce the armor of the opposing soldiers. The Assyrians were the first to deploy cavalry around 1000 BC.
Cavalry troops are army troops that fight on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous figure in culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the Poems Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
The famous Greeks also include the mathematician Pythagoras. He is mostly known for his famous theorem concerning the sides of a right-angled triangle.
There are mixed estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second, third or fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether speakers of very closely related dialects are included.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand Hindi.
The vocabulary of Hindi and Urdu is similar, but the writing system is different. In everyday conversations, speakers of both languages are usually able to understand each other.
Around the 1400s, Northern Estonia experienced considerable German cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the indigenous people, so they invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, to which one character was added: Õ/õ.
Over time, many words borrowed from German merged into the language. It marked the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the army after completing his schooling.
Charles, on the other hand, entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied anthropology and archaeology and later history at Cambridge, graduating with a grade of 2:2 (lower second-grade grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded the degree.
On the European side of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey's land area is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and is roughly rectangular.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world in terms of surface area and is about as large as the European parts of France and Great Britain combined.
Turkey is surrounded by sea in three directions: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it did not gain independence until 1839.
Part of present-day Belgium was formerly part of Luxembourg, but passed to Belgium after its revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always sought to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal's dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the Highlands of Paro County in the village of Phondey.
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is said to have founded the fortress in 1649 to commemorate the victory he gained over the Tibetan and Mongol army.
Due to a fire in 1951, only part of the relics of the Drukyal dzong remain, for example, the image of zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was left in ruins and protected, and remains one of Bhutan's most impressive attractions.
In the 1700s, Cambodia was squeezed by two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 1700s and in 1772 they exterminated Phnom Phen.
In the late 1700s, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those employed work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans in employment are in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans. The country is a net exporter of oil, although only one percent work in the oil sector.
The expertise gained from the Singapore Botanic Garden helped transform the island into a real tropical garden city in the early years of independence.
The hybrid orchid vanda miss joaquim was chosen in 1981 as the national flower of the country.
Every year, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern highlands across the Mara River to the southern plains around October for the rainy season.
And then through the west back north, again across the Mara River, after the rains stopped around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania, and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Interactive design requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and image editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires re-evaluating assumptions about media production and learning to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires that the different parts of the project are related to each other, but are also sensible individual entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the complexity of focal points and the number of lens elements required to achieve the focal length scale is much higher than with fixed focal length lenses.
This is an increasingly rare problem because lens manufacturers achieve better quality in lens production.
This allows zoom lenses to produce images that are comparable in quality to those taken with a fixed focal length lens.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the aperture size (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, inexpensive zoom lenses are inconvenient to use in low-light conditions without a flash.
When trying to convert movies to DVD format, one of the most common problems is overscanning.
Most TVs are designed to please the general public.
That's why everything you see on TV has had edges cut above and below and on the sides.
This ensures that the image fills the entire display screen. It is called overscanning.
When making a DVD recording, unfortunately, its edges are also likely to be cut, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they will not be fully visible.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjured up images of tournaments, feasts and chivalry in Arthur stories.
Just standing among thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles fought long ago, almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobblestones, and smell the fear rising from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical of its period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than an actual castle.
Its large, glazed windows and thin walls could not have withstood a determined attack for long.
When Lord Hastings began construction in the 1480s, the country was relatively calm and defense was only needed against small bands of raiders circling the country.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea was that all European countries had to try to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful, and thus their governments often changed their alliance relations in order to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main cause was the balance of power.
This was an important change, because the European powers no longer had religious wars as an excuse. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last that can be called a war of religion.
The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC. Arson by Herostratus.
According to the story, he was motivated by fame at all costs. The dismayed Ephesians declared that Herostratus' name would never be recorded.
The name was later mentioned by the Greek historian Strabon, and that is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible, but still correctly press all the keys. Also, try not to make a lot of extra movements with your fingers.
In this way, you will get tired as little as possible. Keep in mind that you don't need to press the keys for a higher volume like you do on a piano.
You can increase the volume of the accordion when you use the bellows at higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the attempt to connect with, identify with, or attain awareness of the highest reality, divinity, spiritual reality, or God.
A believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or a deeper understanding of divine reality or a divine being or beings.
Followers engage in certain lifestyles or practices designed to promote such experiences.
Mysticism stands out from other forms of religion and worship in that it emphasizes direct and first-hand experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those that are beautiful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic in nature.
Sikhism is a religion native to the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region as a sect that broke away from the Hindu tradition in the 1400s.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism, although they profess its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion gurmat, which is Punjabi for "guru's way." Gurus are a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism their importance is so great that it forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 14th century by guru Nanak (1469–1539). He was succeeded in order by nine other gurus.
However, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956 when riots in Poland, where workers demonstrated over food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising most of present-day Pakistan and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indus river valley, whence its name originated.
While some scholars think that civilization should be more aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati culture because it also appeared to have dried up in the Sarasvati River basin, others call it the Harappan culture because its first archaeological discoveries were made during the Harappa excavations in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to taking medical developments.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors, and they even formed the first Roman medical corps to be used in the aftermath of the fighting.
The surgeons were familiar with many different sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds and scopolamine from crazy cabbage seeds.
To save patients from gangrene, they became proficient in amputation as well as the use of tourniquets and vein forceps to stop bleeding.
Over several centuries, great medical advances were made in the Roman Empire and much of our current knowledge was collected.
There are such restrictions on Pureland origami that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds, such as inverted folds, are prohibited, and all folds have a rectilinear place.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced artists and people with movement limitations.
Children's awareness of races and racial stereotypes develops at a relatively young age, and such racial stereotypes influence their behaviour.
For example, children who identify as belonging to a stereotypically underperforming racial minority begin to do worse in school after hearing about stereotypes about their race.
MySpace is the third most visited website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have their advantages, including the fact that you can easily create a separate page for a class, which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other things.
The page is easily accessible using only one web address, so it's easy for students who may have trouble typing the keyboard or spelling to remember and type.
It can be customized to be easy to read and as colorful or colorless as desired.
Attention deficit disorder is "a neurological syndrome defined by the classic triad of symptoms of impulsivity, easy distraction, and hyperactivity or hyperenergy."
It is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder. It "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as two million American children."
Children with attention deficit disorder have a hard time focusing on something like school, but they are able to focus on things they like playing, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing punctuated sentences.
These children often get into trouble because they "behave risky, get into fights, and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brains because their brains can't be stimulated by ordinary means.
Attention deficit disorder affects peer relationships because other children don't understand why they behave the way they do, talk the way they do, or why they're at a different level of maturity.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed as mentioned above, the basic level of knowledge acquisition changed.
The approach to obtaining knowledge was different. The pressure was no longer on individual memorization, but instead began to focus more on the ability to remember text.
In essence, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and knowledge dissemination.
Unlike other primates, great apes no longer use their hands to move, hold a weight, or move around trees by waving themselves.
The chimpanzee's arm and leg are the same size and length, suggesting that weight is reserved for the hand when knuckle walking.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, and its finger bones are straighter.
Fossils of armbones two to three million years old reveal the hand in the specialization of this change from movement to behavior.
Some believe that having many artificially induced lucid dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the lengthening of the periods between the REM phases as a result of lucid dreaming.
When there are fewer REM phases during the night, the state in which you actually sleep and during which the body recovers becomes so irregular that it becomes a problem.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times a night your brain tries to have lucid dreams.
The Italians were doing poorly in North Africa almost from the beginning. A week after Italy's declaration of war on 10.6.1940, the British Army's 11th Hussar Regiment had captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, General Lastucci, commander-in-chief of the pioneer forces of the Italian Tenth Army, was captured by the British.
Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and a possible successor to Mussolini, was killed on 28 June by gunfire from his own troops as he landed in Tobruk.
Fencing is practiced as a modern sport at many different levels, from university students to professional competitions and the Olympic Games.
The sport is mainly practiced as a duel between one fencer and another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
In a regular round, eighteen holes are played so that players usually start on the first hole of the course and finish on the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest strokes to complete the course wins.
The game is played on the grass. The grass around the hole is shaved shorter, and it is called greenery.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one that most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
In it, people leave their regular daily lives in a very different place to relax and have fun.
Sandy beaches, amusement parks and campsites are often the most common places for recreational tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, then that type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different destinations in a particular country, or they may focus on only one region.
The settlers had also called for reinforcements when they saw this happening.
The troops strengthening their forward positions included two hundred men of the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later becoming generals).
Stark's men took up positions next to the fence at the north end of the settler station.
When low tide opened an opening along the Mystic River to the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly lengthened the fence to the north with a short stone wall that ended at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley, or Stark, sank a stake into the ground about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered that no one be allowed to fire until British soldiers had passed it.
The American plan relied on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was to launch a diversion attack against the British garrison at Bordentown to cut off the way for possible reinforcements.
General James Erwing would take 700 troops across the river at the Trenton Ferry, take control of the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevent enemy forces from fleeing.
The main force of the attackers, 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one led by Greene and the other by Sullivan, to begin the attack before dawn.
When moving from a quarter mile to a half-mile run, the importance of speed is greatly reduced, and endurance becomes absolutely essential.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a man with a time of less than two minutes, must be quite fast, but endurance must also be developed by all means.
The best preparation for the running season is some cross-country running during the winter combined with upper body gym workouts.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot achieve elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the different aspects of dietary supplement use can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy sports more.
Medium-distance running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions about the minimal equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even though it does not actually bring benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental constituents of all matter.
It is a very complex entity and, according to Bohr's simplified model, consists of a central nucleus that electrons orbit in much the same way as planets orbit the Sun (see Figure 1.1).
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, neutrons do not have a charge. The electric charge of electrons is negative.
Make sure the scene is safe before checking the injured person.
When approaching an injured person, note their posture and other obvious signs of danger.
If you injure yourself while helping, you may only aggravate the situation.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophe mediate the relationship between pain and disability in people with low back pain.
Only those affected by the disaster were allowed to participate in the weekly structured sessions of physical activity. Suffering from depression and fear was not enough.
Those involved in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative perception of pain to distinguish chronic pain from the discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
The sense of sight, or the ability to see, depends on the sense organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are many different structures of the eye, and their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different abilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and vary in sharpness. They also need different processing skills to interpret the input they see and different amounts to perform as well as possible.
A population is the sum of organisms of a given species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of a particular phenotypic characteristic, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show multiple variations of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Wandering ant colonies also march and nest at different stages.
During the migration phase, wandering ants march at night and stop at camp for the day.
The colony begins its migration phase when the available food is reduced. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests, which change daily.
Each of these hiking battles or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell, used in many languages, comes from the Latin word "cella", which means small room. It was developed by a microscope operator who studied the structure of the cap.
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and essential to the study of life that they are often referred to as the building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow running and undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, keeping it safe from potential threats.
Tornadoes hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything that gets in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, remove boards from houses and throw cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
Winds from these giant storms can reach up to 480 kilometers per hour (133 meters per second or 300 miles per hour).
People have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands upon thousands of years.
However, the first actual telescopes were made in Europe in the late 1500s.
The telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make the objects appear to be both closer and larger.
There will always be greed and selfishness. Cooperation is also characterised by the fact that, in the short term, when acting in the interests of the majority, selfish action brings the greatest benefit to the individual.
Hopefully, most people will understand that in the long run, their best option is to collaborate with others.
Many dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some wonder what can be found there. Some believe that there may be alien beings or other life on other planets.
If this ever happens, it probably won't be for a long time. The stars are so far apart that the distance between the "neighboring stars" is trillions of miles.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in an unknown world and think about their ancient ancestors.
Animals consist of many cells. They eat food and digest it inside. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have – jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals can be found in every corner of the world. They burrow into the ground, swim in the seas and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism (living being).
In many languages, the origin of the word cell is in the Latin word cella, which means small room.
If you look at living beings under a microscope, you can see them formed by small squares or balls.
English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in the cap when he looked at it under a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can change from one state to another and still not change.
Gaseous nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure as a gas, liquid and solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, yet it is difficult to understand.
Practitioners of religion, philosophy and natural sciences have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that run from the future through the present to the past.
With the help of time, we also compare the duration of events.
The passage of time can also be noticed by observing how the cyclical event repeats. A cyclical event is one that occurs regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to process images and videos.
Advanced animations can be made on a computer, and such animations are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers. They process sounds and mix sounds together.
For a long time, the first inhabitants of New Zealand in the 1800s and 1900s were believed to have been Maori who hunted giant birds called moa.
After that, the theory established the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia to the so-called Siberian Empire. as a great fleet, conquered New Zealand from the Moriors and established an agricultural society.
However, in light of new evidence, it appears that the Moriori were a group of Maori living on the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and formed their own peaceful culture there.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands. These were Maori who had emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves moriorit. There were a few clashes, and eventually the Moriors were completely wiped out
People who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions and, at the same time, openly evaluate our difficulties and even failures.
Listening to individuals share their own, family and business stories gave us valuable insight into the past and specific individuals who positively or negatively influenced the culture of the organization.
While understanding one's own history doesn't require understanding culture, it at least helps people get a sense of their own place in the organization's history.
As they evaluate successes and become more aware of failures, individuals and all participants as a whole become more deeply aware of the values, missions, and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, remembering past instances of entrepreneurial behavior and subsequent success helped people be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change and created positive perceptions of future changes.
Convergent thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or disciplines to find a solution.
At the heart of this mindset are speed, logic and accuracy, as well as fact identification, reuse of existing technologies and data collection.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. Let's think of only two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this way of thinking think logically, are able to memorize repetitive patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific experiments.
Human beings are by far the most gifted species when it comes to reading other people's minds.
In other words, we are able to successfully predict what other people will understand, mean, believe, know or want.
In addition to these skills, it is very important to understand other people's intentions. In this way, we can resolve the possible ambiguity of physical acts.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you're probably assuming they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
His actions need to be assessed differently if he has lost his car keys and tries to break into his own car.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (while working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit very small radio signals.
In 1970, physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered how magnetic resonance imaging could be used to make medical diagnoses.
The patent was granted four years later. This was the first patent granted in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Damadian completed his first "full body" MRI machine, which he named Indomitable.
Asynchronous communication gives time to think and react to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructions received.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints and flexible working hours are possible (Bremer 1998).
The use of the Internet and online content allows learners to access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to instructors at any time of the day and get relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning frees us from absolutes. There is not just one good way to learn.
In fact, there isn't even one good thing to learn. Learning is the experience that takes place between the learner and the information presented.
Our current experience with all DIY programs and informational, learning-based television shows illustrates this.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that tells us about a process or experience in which we never participate or take advantage of this information.
We never renovate a car, build a fountain in the backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or renovate a neighbor's house.
Thanks to undersea fibre optic connections to Europe and a broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a guesthouse or private residence) probably have WiFi or a computer connected to the Internet, and all population centers have an Internet café or a place with public WiFi.
As mentioned above, although the word Eskimo is still accepted in the United States, many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially Canada, find it derogatory.
You may hear the indigenous people of Greenland use this word, but foreigners should still avoid using it.
The indigenous people of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada, and in Greenland they use the word kalaalleq (plural kalaallit), Greenlandic.
Crime and evil intentions towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "notorious areas".
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that the unprepared faces.
If you are visiting Greenland during the cold season (also keeping in mind that its northern parts are the coldest), it is imperative to bring warm enough clothing.
The long days of summer can cause difficulties getting enough sleep and related health problems.
In summer, you should also watch out for mosquitoes. Although they do not carry disease, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist destination, its economy is very diverse.
The largest employers are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
The city's repeated appearances in music, film, literature and popular culture have made it and its landmarks familiar around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants and state-of-the-art exhibition centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to explore other Asian food: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
A typical visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel on the grounds of an amusement park, a stay of about a week without leaving Disney lands, and then a return home.
There are an endless number of different implementation options, but this is what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disney World."
Many of the tickets sold through online auctions such as eBay or Craigslist are multi-day tickets valid in several parks that have already been partially used.
This is very common, but Disney has banned it: tickets cannot be transferred to another person.
Camping below the edge of the Grand Canyon requires a camping permit.
The number of permits is limited to protect the canyon and will become available on the first day of the month four months before the start month.
In other words, a camping permit for the May start date will become available on January 1.
Places in the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel camping area next to Phantom Ranch, usually fill up on the first day they open for reservations.
For those arriving without a reservation, a limited number of permits are reserved, which are issued on a first-come, first-served basis.
Traveling to South Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the whole region and get to places outside of the usual tourist routes.
It can be done with a regular car if the trip is carefully planned, but all-wheel drive is highly recommended, and many destinations are only achievable with a four-wheel drive vehicle with high ground clearance.
When planning a trip, remember that while the situation in South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries have.
Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country, and your home country plays a role.
Each country also has its own laws on what mandatory equipment a car should have.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe. Livingstone is across the border in Zambia, and Botswana is also nearby.
The city is located right next to the falls, and they are the main attraction. Still, the popular tourist destination offers plenty of opportunities for longer stays for adventure seekers and sightseeers.
In the rainy season (from November to March), the amount of water is greater and the falls look more dramatic.
You will definitely get wet if you cross a bridge or walk along winding paths near the falls.
On the other hand, you still can't see the falls well – all that water is blocking you!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of all the tombs in the valley, the place where Howard Carter in 1922 discovered the almost untouched royal tomb of the young pharaoh.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is barely worth a visit as it is much smaller and less decorated.
Anyone who wants to see traces of the damage inflicted on the mummy when an attempt was made to take it out of its coffin will be disappointed, since only its head and shoulders are visible.
The great riches of the tomb are no longer in their former place, but have been taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time should spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built in the late 800s during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dim atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonle Sap make climbing the hill worth the effort.
The trip to the place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
You need an Angkor pass to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your country passport when heading to Lake Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city of the Judean hills has a fascinating history that has continued for thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Due to its religious significance and especially the many attractions located in the Old City, Jerusalem is one of Israel's most important tourist destinations.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as shopping malls, cafés and restaurants bursting with life and people.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have received an invitation letter prior to entering Ecuador through international airports or ground inspection posts.
The letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must meet certain requirements.
The requirements are intended to make the flow of migrants between countries systematic.
Cuban citizens with U.S. work and residence permits must visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain exemption from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the trip. Proof of length of stay requires a return ticket or a connecting ticket.
Tours are cheaper for large groups, so if you're traveling alone or with just one friend, try to get to know other people and form a group of 4-6 people for a better individual price.
However, you probably don't have to worry about this, as tourists are often moved from one car to another to fill up all the seats.
It seems to be more of a way to trick people into believing they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, often seen in the background of photographs of ruins.
It looks a little intimidating from the bottom, and the climb is steep and difficult, but those in reasonably good shape should get through it in about 45 minutes.
The path is mostly covered with stone steps, and the steeper parts are supported by a railing made of steel cable.
Nevertheless, you can expect to get out of breath, and you should be careful on the steeper sections, especially in wet conditions, as the trail can quickly become dangerous.
Near the peak there is a small cave through which you have to pass. It is quite low and quite cramped.
The sites and fauna of the Galapagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships operate in the waters of the Galapagos Islands, ranging in size from eight to one hundred passengers.
Most people book their seats well in advance (as ships are usually full during peak season).
Make sure the officer you are booking through is a Galapagos expert who knows a lot about different types of ships.
This will ensure that you find the vessel that best suits your interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 1500s, northern Chile was under Inca rule, and the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuchet) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of America's last independent indigenous peoples and had not been completely subjugated to Spanish-speaking rule until Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (for a few years during the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government), the final victory over Spain did not come until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean Sea country that forms the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Along with white sandy beaches and mountain views, the country is home to America's oldest European city, now part of Santo Domingo.
The Tainos and Caribs were the first inhabitants of the island. The Caribs were an Arawak-speaking people who had come to the island around 10,000 BC.
The Spanish conquistadors had greatly reduced the population of the Tainos within only a few years of the arrival of European explorers
According to the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 stalkers.
Jardín de la Unión. The estate was built as an atrium to a 16th-century convent whose only remaining building is the Templo de San Diego.
It is now the central square and is always bustling around the clock.
Several restaurants surround the garden, and on several afternoons and evenings free concerts are held in the main gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies, only 69 centimetres apart, tell an old love story.
Children tell the whole story in exchange for a few coins.
Bowen Island is a popular day and weekend excursion destination offering kayak rowing, camping, shops, restaurants and more.
The authentic community is located on the banks of Howen Strait, just outside Vancouver, and is easily accessible by regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For outdoor enthusiasts, a trip to the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky Corridor is a must.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive but famous thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter you can enjoy some of the best skiing conditions in North America and in summer you can try real mountain biking.
Permits must be reserved in advance. A permit is required to stay overnight in Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that offers accommodation in dormitories and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food service.
Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forest Management Center, but it is not possible to pay by credit card
The Park Service (MINAE) issues park permits up to one month before the intended arrival time.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for $30 or day tickets for $10. More detailed information can be found on its Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island nation in Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. It is an associate state of New Zealand.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands with an ocean area of more than 2.2 million square kilometers.
Because the islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes referred to as Hawaii of the Southern Hemisphere.
Although smaller than Hawaii, they remind some elderly visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, and above all, large tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have a single city, but consist of fifteen different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, providing luxury B&Bs has become something of an art form.
Of course, the best B&B providers compete mainly in two main areas: accommodation and breakfast.
So, at best, such places may have truly luxurious sleeping conditions, for example, a handmade blanket or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies or some bravura from the hosts.
The setting can be an old historic building with antique furniture, trimmed lawns and swimming pools.
Getting in your own car and going on a long trip is naturally attractive in all its simplicity.
You are probably already familiar with driving your own car, and you know its limitations, unlike large vehicles.
Pitching a tent on a private property or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, your own car is ideal for car travel, but it can rarely be used for actual camping.
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with horizontal seats.
Some of the hotels date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, the 1800s or early 1900s, the period before World War II.
The rich and famous people of their time stayed in these hotels, often offering gourmet cuisine and nightlife.
Old-fashioned settings, the absence of the most modern amenities and a certain dignified old age are also part of their nature.
They are usually privately owned, but occasionally accommodate visiting Heads of State and other dignitaries.
A tourist with heaps of money could consider a round-the-world flight, punctuated by visits to several of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that connects tourists with local residents of the cities they plan to visit.
You can usually join such a network only by filling out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional verification.
The list of available hosts is then organized on paper and/or online, sometimes with recommendations and reviews from other travelers.
CouchSurfing was founded in January 2004 when computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had nowhere to stay.
He emailed students at a local university and received a huge number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are mainly for young travellers – the typical guest is in their twenties – but you can often find older travellers as well.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels accept them in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will host the Winter Olympics in 2022. Thus, it becomes the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing hosts opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will be held at Taizicheng Ski Area in Zhangjiakou, located about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual feast between late November and mid-May. The timing depends on each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple celebrations are held as part of its anniversary, in honor of the birthday of the temple's supreme deity, or on the occasion of any other important event associated with the temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala are very interesting to follow because they include elephants decorated as a regular procession, a temple orchestra, and other festivities.
The World's Fair (sometimes also known as the Expo) is a major international art and science event.
The participating countries organise artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions highlighting global issues or the culture and history of their own country.
International Horticultural Exhibitions are specialized events that highlight flower arrangements, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although theoretically they can be held every year (as long as they are held in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
Such events usually last three to six months and take place on areas of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, several different types of film have been used. Standard 35 mm film (36 × 24 mm negative) is by far the most common.
A new one can usually be easily replaced if it runs out, and its resolution is more or less comparable to current DSLR cameras.
Some medium-format film cameras use an image size of 6 × 6 centimetres, more precisely 56 × 56 mm negatives.
As a result, the resolution is almost four times that of a 35mm negative (3136 mm2 vs. 864).
Wildlife is one of the most challenging subjects for a photographer, and shooting them successfully requires good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Photographing wildlife is often taken for granted, but, as in photography in general, one picture is worth a thousand words.
Photographing wildlife often requires a long remote lens, but some subjects, such as flocks of birds and tiny animals, require other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about taking pictures for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either timid or aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot, or otherwise unpleasant.
More than 5,000 different languages are spoken in the world. More than twenty have at least 50 million speakers.
Similarly, a printed word is often easier to understand than a spoken word. This is especially true for street addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
Many entire nations speak English perfectly fluently, and even more can be expected to have at least limited skills – especially among young people.
For example, imagine a Manchesterist, Bostonian, Jamaican, and Sydney dining at a table in a Toronto restaurant.
They feast on each other with stories about their hometowns and tell them with their own accents and local slang.
Buying food from a supermarket is usually the cheapest way to be nourished. However, without cooking possibilities, the options are limited to ready-made food.
The range of ready-to-eat meals in supermarkets is becoming more and more diverse. Some even offer a microwave or other ways to heat food.
Some countries or store types have at least one restaurant, often quite casual and reasonably priced.
Take copies of your insurance policies and keep them and your insurance company's contact information with you.
They must include the insurer's email address and international telephone numbers for advice or authorization and making claims.
Also, keep one copy with your luggage and online (send it to yourself as an email attachment or store it in the cloud).
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, keep one copy in its memory or on a disc (available without an internet connection).
Also provide copies of insurance and contact information to your travel companions and relatives or friends staying at home who are willing to help.
Deer are not naturally aggressive, but defend themselves when they suspect danger.
When people don't perceive moose as potentially dangerous, they may approach them too much and put themselves in danger.
Consume alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it's important to know your limits.
The longer-term effects of excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The risk of danger increases when consuming illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities, for example, methanol, which even in small doses can cause blindness or death.
Glasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries with lower labor costs.
It's a good idea to get an eye test at home, especially if your insurance covers it, and take your prescription with you to pick up elsewhere.
There may be two problems with luxury branded frames available from such regions: some may be fakes, and real imported frames may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's best-selling commodities, and you'll probably be able to find many different types in your area.
Nevertheless, there are many unique coffee drinking habits around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning means going to the bottom of a canyon, either dry or water-filled.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping, but it requires relatively little practice or physical fitness to get started (compared to, for example, rock climbing, equipment diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in a natural environment, often on hiking trails.
Day hiking refers to distances ranging from less than a mile to longer distances if they can be covered in one day.
A day hike on an easy trail requires very little preparation and is suitable for anyone in reasonable condition.
Those exercising with young children may need more preparation, but a day out is easily doable even with babies and preschoolers.
There are nearly 200 running organisations worldwide that organise city tours. Most of them work independently.
The successor to Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours is a network of dozens of sightseeing tour organisers on four continents.
It originated from Running Tours Barcelona in Barcelona and Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen. Prague-based Running Tours Prague quickly joined in.
There are several things you need to consider both before you travel somewhere and when traveling.
When traveling, don't expect things to be the same as at home. Customs, laws, food, transport, accommodation, quality levels, language, etc. differ to some extent from those where you live.
You should always keep this in mind to avoid disappointment or perhaps even dislike for local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 1800s. A travel agent is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond the tourist's previous experience of nature, cultures, languages, or low-income countries.
While most travel agents are happy to accept most standard bookings, many specialize in specific types of travel, price ranges, or destinations.
It may be better to use a clerk who often books trips similar to the one you're planning for.
Look either on the website or in the shop window to see what kind of trips the representative offers.
If you want to see the world cheaply – whether it's out of necessity, lifestyle, or because you're looking for a challenge – there are ways to do it.
In practice, they fall into two categories: you can either work while traveling or try to limit your expenses. This article will focus on the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce expenses to near zero, take a look at minimum budget travel.
The advice assumes that tourists do not steal, invade unauthorized places, operate on the black market, beg or otherwise exploit people.
An entry control post is usually the first stop after disembarking an aircraft, ship or other means of transport.
On some international trains, checks are carried out while the train is in motion, and you must have a valid ID with you when boarding such a train.
On night trains, the conductor may collect your passports so that you don't have to disturb your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement of the visa procedure. In some countries, you will need to inform the local authorities of your arrival and the address where you are staying.
The requirements may include filling in a form at a local police station or visiting an immigration office.
In many countries where such a law applies, registration is handled by local hotels (you should ask to make sure).
In other cases, only those staying outside the tourist accommodation have to register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so it is worth finding out beforehand.
Architecture is about designing and building buildings. The architecture of a destination is often an attraction in itself.
Many of the buildings are very beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or an imaginatively placed window can be eye-catching.
Architecture has considerable overlap with other disciplines such as urban planning, building engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how remote several pueblos are, you won't find a more noticeable nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them also offer branded entertainment (especially the largest casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars aren't always the best places to hang out here.
First, drunk driving is a major problem in northern New Mexico, and concentrations of intoxicated drivers are significant near small-town bars.
Murals or scribbles that are unwanted are known as graffiti.
While this is certainly not a new phenomenon, most people probably associate it with the vandalism of public and private property by young people with spray paints.
Today, however, there are already established graffiti artists, graffiti events, and "legal" walls. In this context, graffiti paintings often resemble art instead of illegible tags.
Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for this purpose.
Most boomerangs available in Australia don't actually come back. It is best for beginners not to try throwing in windy conditions
Hangi meal is prepared in a hot earth pit.
The pit is heated either with hot stones taken from the campfire, or in some places geothermal heat some parts of the soil naturally.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional barbecue-style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal snow. Other types of snow can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes for commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (called third class).
The MetroPlus is more comfortable and less cramped, but it's a bit more expensive. On the other hand, it is still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages. MetroPlus cars are always at the Cape Town end of the train.
Exporting for others – Never let your bags out of sight, especially when crossing borders.
You may find yourself unknowingly becoming a drug smuggler, which causes you really bad problems.
It involves standing in line, as sniffer dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries impose extremely severe penalties, even on first-time offenders. These could include more than 10 years in prison or death.
Unguarded bags are vulnerable to theft and can also attract the attention of authorities who are on guard for bomb threats.
You are very likely to be immune to bacteria in your area because you are constantly exposed to them.
But in other parts of the world where you are not familiar with the bacterial strain, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
And that's how you get traveler's diarrhoea, i.e. Delhi's belly, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge, and their many different friends.
Like respiratory problems in cold climates, bowel problems in hot climates are quite common and, in most cases, undeniably embarrassing, but not exactly dangerous.
If it's your first time traveling in a developing country – or in a previously unknown part of the world – don't underestimate the potential for culture shock.
The novelty of developing world travel has surprised many routine and skilled travellers. In world travel, small cultural adaptations have to be made all the time.
Especially in the first few days, it is worth splurging on hotels, food and services that represent Western style and quality to make it easier to adapt.
Do not sleep on the ground on a mattress or sleeping surface in places where you are not familiar with the fauna.
If you plan to camp outside, bring a field bed or hammock to stay out of reach of snakes and scorpions and the like.
Enjoy a full-bodied coffee in the morning and a relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you're on vacation, you'll have time to pamper yourself and take a few extra minutes to simmer in something special.
If you're feeling more adventurous, take the opportunity to juice or mix a couple of smoothies:
You can even find a simple drink to prepare for breakfast when you get back to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars or pubs in areas where you don't stop by often.
For the information of those who are not familiar with medical vocabulary: the words infectious disease and infectious disease have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasite.
An infectious disease is one that spreads easily by being near an infected person.
Many authorities require visitors or residents entering or leaving the country to be vaccinated against a variety of diseases.
The requirements may often depend on which countries the tourist has visited or intends to visit.
One of the great things about Charlotte, North Carolina is that it has a lot of high-quality options for families with children.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as the main reason for moving to the city, and many visitors find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options outside of downtown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Families don't usually use taxis in Charlotte, but they can be useful in some situations.
More than two passengers are charged an additional fee, so the option may be unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place during the summer from November to February and are mainly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
During the summer, a few thousand personnel live in approximately fifty bases in Antarctica, which are mainly located in these areas. A small number of them live over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a deserted plain covered by a layer of ice 2–3 kilometers thick.
Sometimes you can get inland on specialized air tours for mountaineering or to travel to the pole. There is a large base at the South Pole.
The South Pole Road is a 1,600-kilometer-long route to the pole from McMurdo Station on the shores of the Ross Sea.
It is dense snow, the cracks of which are filled and marked with flags. The route can only be traversed by special tractors pulling sleds containing fuel and supplies behind them.
These are not very agile, so the route will have to make a long bend around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of winter accidents is slippery roads, sidewalks and especially stairs.
At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, and some winter boots are also deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough for cold temperatures.
Some shoes have studs, and studded anti-slip barriers are available for slippery conditions, which fit most shoes and boots. They are attached either to the heel and sole of the shoe, or only to the heel.
The heel should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads and paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not unusual. Steep slopes can only support a certain amount of snow, and anything above that falls down in an avalanche.
The problem is the stickiness of the snow, so it needs a stimulus to come down. And when some of the snow comes down, it might act as a stimulus for the rest of the snow.
Sometimes the event is triggered by the warming of snow in the sun, sometimes by snowfall, sometimes by other natural events, often by man.
A tornado is a rotating column of very low pressure air that draws in ambient air inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them away with a tornado.
They start as funnels coming down from storm clouds and turn into tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Personal VPN providers are a great way to circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are better than proxies for several reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just http traffic.
They often have higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
Media companies routinely lie about its purpose, claiming that it is "prevention of piracy".
In fact, region codes have no effect on piracy: an identical copy of the disc works just as well on the same devices as the original.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets – it's all about making money.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you don't need to use a telephone operator where you live or where you're traveling.
There is also no need to get a phone number where you live. You can connect to the Internet via satellite from Chicken's wilderness areas in Alaska and dial a number to supposedly be in the Arizona sunshine.
It is often necessary to purchase a global number separately in order to be able to call you on phones on the telephone network. Where the number comes from matters to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications – applications that are capable of translating entire pieces of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category are even capable of translating foreign text from signs or other real-world objects when the user points to them on their smartphone.
Translation machines have improved significantly and now give more or less correct translations (and less and less gibberish), but caution is advised, as even a complete mistake is still possible.
One of the most outstanding applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation once the information in the desired language has been downloaded to the device.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you're not in your home country.
It can save you money compared to buying new maps for your GPS tracker, buying a completely new GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone has no data connection or is out of range of your data connection, their performance may be limited or non-existent.
Each corner kiosk has a bewildering selection of prepaid calling cards that can be used for public or regular phones.
Most cards are valid for any type of call, but some specialize in offering custom rate calls to specific groups of countries.
Often these services are used from toll-free phone numbers, which can be called from most phones free of charge.
The rules of ordinary photography also apply to video shooting, maybe even more.
If taking a picture of something is not allowed, then shooting a video should not even be considered.
If you plan to use a drone, check well in advance what you are allowed to photograph and what permits or other licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or on top of a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline before first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes prices for the same flight can differ significantly from one aggregate search site, and it's a good idea to compare search results and also look at the airline's own website before booking.
Although some countries do not require a visa for short tourist or business trips, entering them as an international student often requires a longer stay than as a casual traveler.
Generally speaking, spending a longer period of time in any foreign country requires obtaining a visa in advance.
Student visas are generally subject to different requirements and application processes than tourist and work visas.
In most countries, you will need a letter from the institution where you want to study and prove that you can afford to support yourself at least during your first year of study.
Check with the educational institution and the immigration authorities of the country where you want to study for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you have to pay income tax in the country where you are staying.
Income tax is formed differently in different countries, and tax rates and tax brackets vary greatly from country to country.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at both the federal and local levels, so tax rates and categories may vary from region to region.
Although when you return home, an entry check is usually either missing or merely a formality, a customs check can be cumbersome.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring into the country, and declare everything that exceeds the legal import limits.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing industry is to hone your skills on an established travel blog site.
Once you learn how to format and edit online, you can later create your own website.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living abroad by volunteering is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn things about yourself, develop a sense of proportion and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch your budget to allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs include food and maintenance, and some even pay low salaries.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check the possible need for special permits, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly by rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so getting there from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
You can be sure that once you get to the marina, everything will be pretty self-explanatory. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you put up advertisements offering help, wander around shipyards, approach people cleaning their yachts, try to talk to sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. Soon everyone will know you and give tips on which boat assistants are needed.
You should carefully choose which airline alliance you choose for your frequent flyer program.
While you may think it makes sense to become a frequent flyer for the airline you fly the most, you should be aware that the privileges offered often differ, and frequent flyers may receive points more generously from another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa and offer connections to many major African cities at more competitive prices than European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries (as of 2014).
If you have extra travel time, you should check how the total cost of your trip to Africa compares to the price of a trip around the world.
Don't forget to add additional visas, airport taxis, ground transportation, etc. in all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the flights and destinations you can choose from are limited due to the lack of intercontinental routes.
No airline alliance covers the crossing of all three oceans in the southern hemisphere (nor does SkyTeam cover the first one).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific between Santiago de Chile and Tahiti. It is a Oneworld flight with LATAM.
This flight isn't the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America (see below).
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With the support of Armenians, a new republic was created. No established state – not even Armenia – officially recognises it.
Diplomatic disputes over control of the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 16th-century district surrounding Amsterdam's Binnenstad.
The entire area has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property prices are among the highest in the country.
The Cinque Terre, which means five countries, consists of five small coastal villages located in the Liguria region of Italy. They are Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on rugged and steep terrain right up to the cliffs of the seashore.
The lack of visible commercialization is part of its charm. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The forms of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, but they are similar enough to be intelligible.
In particular, the number system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has its subtle oddities that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words differs slightly.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school, so they will understand you even if you use the normal French number system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means greeting.
However, in Malaysia, and at least among rural Malaysians, it means "come here" a bit like the gesture used in some Western countries to bend the index finger towards the body, and it should only be used for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain can confuse a wave with a palm facing (rather than waving) the person waving goodbye as a request to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or artificial languages created to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with each other.
They are different from lingua francas, i.e. natural or organic languages which, for one reason or another, have become dominant as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers may see mirages that create the illusion of water (or something else).
They can be dangerous if the tourist tries towards the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can be extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothes.
Especially in summer, you have to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to hike through the rainforest.
Even if you are driving through a subtropical rainforest, opening the doors for a few seconds when you get into the vehicle is enough for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
Bird flu can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have been recorded in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most have involved people working with poultry, but birdwatchers are also a bit exposed.
Steep fjords and valleys that suddenly turn into a somewhat flat highland are typical of Norway.
These plains are often referred to as vidde, which means a wide and open treeless area, an boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually referred to as hei, which means treeless, often heather-covered moorland.
Glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountainside. This causes cracks and crevices that may be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caverns may collapse and the tracks may close.
At the edges of glaciers, huge boulders come off, fall off, and may pop or roll farther away from the edges.
The tourist season in mountain stations is usually at its peak during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different beauty and charm in winter, with many mountain stations getting plenty of snow and offering opportunities for activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer the so-called. mourning fares that make last-minute funeral trips a little cheaper.
Airlines that offer them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the United States and Canada, and Westjet.
In all cases, the booking must be made by phone directly with the airline.
