The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent member.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio will be approximately 111 000.

Plans for extended nuclear cooperation are at the forefront of discussion.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kyiv leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct a substantial political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, whose Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current places, where Putin said that Ukrainian army troops are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It surprised me that people came in the early evening.
There were visitors as expected over the course of two days, says Promotor Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be a hip-hop festival, so there will be no pop, Kangas assures.
A law will enter into force in Finland on Tuesday, which restricts the procurement of suitable substances for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private individuals will have to apply to the National Police Board for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called precursor of explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is found, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration driving.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of Nairn and Pitlochry hotel rapes
The accused of rape in two hotels is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the hearing before the Higher Court in Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland’s Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman “when she is in a state of unconsciousness, while sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision herself.”
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Higher Court of Justice.
Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, who had been strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian work on the pitch with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and assisted on only half of his sixteen assists on his own team.
Pool supporters, who have already become their favourite, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers implanted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who had travelled to Barcelona, to become the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The team's star was Raheem Sterling, who spotted a 3-0 victory over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with her power.
The Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than the Balotelli is between the opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who speeds on the grass at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves a big thank you for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a player from a Northwest Londoner who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I'm happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016 onwards.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start her new position with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in Finland's music life for more than a hundred years, for example by premiering a large amount of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I look forward to our future cooperation," he says.
Governments of employee organisations to meet in the pension negotiation matter - Finland - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, pension negotiations are being sought at a new momentum from the labour market organisations' own meetings.
The administrations of the employee organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be resumed.
Labour market organisations have been aggravated, among other things, in the dispute over the tying of the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created this week.
Plier pudas.
Woman Volley, a women's volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, stumbled on the league's athletes Vampula in the final of the Pihtipudas training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula won the 3-2 match in five rounds.
WoVo lost 15-11 in the final period.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and the pass game, Vampula was a bit better, saw WoVo's coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six was twitchy in the sense that the 190-centimetre American center Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the sidelines.
The center was Sara Niemi.
Despite his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed the most firepower combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "kauppis" at 18 in the official practice game.
On Sunday we will meet at the sports school again.
Lidl is making wild figures in Finland
The company's net sales in stores in Finland grew by almost 25 per cent to nearly 1.2 billion euros during the financial year that ended at the end of February.
The company released its earnings on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is to be continued.
Lidl also said that almost 14 million euros in taxes were paid to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to a late diagnosis and access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the health history of women over a period of seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and when the cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the chances of survival were the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers the possible causes of delayed diagnosis and inconvenience of access to treatment.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease the best, and their clinics are mostly located in major cities,” Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of physicians so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients treated far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old mother Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the sled parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the town plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be made publicly available at the service point Osviitta.
The Environmental Committee and the Lapland Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment are invited to comment on the plan proposal.
With the help of the city plan change, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobiling activities related to tourism in the area.
The aim is to form a park area, which includes the current area between Friendship Park and it and the river.
According to the proposal, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
Refueling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and the change in the plan have attracted even loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring apartment buildings have been both concerned about sound and emissions.
However, the emissions from the area have been studied, and the studies have not revealed observations that exceed the guideline values.
The renewed equipment is also lower-emission than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, the hotel's safari customers should be transported to the starting points of the safaris by buses, which would be estimated to have 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surroundings of the Friendship Park are also wide enough for sleds, better than the places proposed as replacement places, such as the boat pier east of the Ounasjoki bridges.
In terms of its location, Friendship Park is also good because the activities may expand to the Ounaspaviljonki area, for example, in the future.
The establishment of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City's goal is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by reserving sufficient high-quality areas in logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre's partial master plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied apartments is visible in garden shops
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the under-35 group, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, while today’s young consumers will reach the “main target group” for garden sales for their age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the British Horticultural Trades Association (HTA).
According to a Financial Times report, renters spend only 55 percent of the amount spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved into a parking lot. These factors also threaten the horticultural sector, which is estimated to be worth about 5 billion pounds a year.
In the London sub-area, housing ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, where horticultural products are the least money spent in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in the renting of apartments or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden advisor at RHS, says that “for example, plants grown in transplantable growing containers are particularly popular among home renters, as such growing containers can be taken with them in the move if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997 to 2005 were the heyday of the resale of the horticultural sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, as last year's March and April weather will be worse.
Turkey is questioning a U.S. diplomat over the espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on the report on spying by Americans and Britons in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Embassy's attorney and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) former analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spy target of the U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on the spying on the German main intelligence service Ankara caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several blockbuster films, is attached to the female lead in the new Finnish film.
Croze will star in director Mikko Kuparinen's film 2 nights in the morning, the filming of which will start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 Barbarian invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's The Butterfly Glass Dome.
The male lead role of the film 2 Nights in the Morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Mallorca's Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Those who made the case revealed evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Office of the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, located on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested for humid partying following allegations of corruption made by the shops and bar owners of the known Magaluf region.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several business owners on Punta Ballena filed corruption charges against him. Most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the people who made the case out presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Office of the Prosecutor for Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with the corruption charges and they are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The daily newspaper ABC, published throughout the country, wrote that nightclub owners were angry about the bias of the authorities, which significantly complicated their business.
“It’s no longer about money, it’s about survival,” one business owner told the court.
You're not destroying our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of several countries this summer when a YouTube video was circulated online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to curb the drunk and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf's holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in infamous, alcohol-fueled pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl, Carnage, was jointly ordered to pay a fine of 55 000 euros.
Above all, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists has also become a popular so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption, when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mortars bombed their communities during the 50-day Israeli-Hamas War and the schools remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the communities of southern Israel bombed by the rockets, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashosh, workers removed the traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz named Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher in a city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said the return to school after a long time feels “a little strange.”
“We’ve had a hard time when we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of communities in the Saad-like border region had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and mortars.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz community, located near the Gaza Front, are skeptical of the return of the Palestinian grenade killed in the community of a 4-year-old boy.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than a dozen families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire until further notice last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the removal of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of the Gaza air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect talks later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disagrees with the number of deaths. According to it, at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had any solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
In battle, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and mortars into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5 000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelters in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still under shelter and the fighting continued, school authorities postponed the start of school the week before.
“I hope that the school will open soon and we can go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school sheltered in Gaza.
According to a commonly used meter, house prices have risen most to seven years in Australia's winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home price index, which measures the prices of housing in the Australian capital, rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, the total increase in prices during June, July and August was 4.2 per cent, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the rise in prices.
The results of RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the increase in the sale of the apartments to be auctioned, the overall high pace of sales and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and features, among other things, classics of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Festival, on the other hand, said on Monday that it had set a visitor record, when 14 500 people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
Such figures are not used to.
People have been snubbed through doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors for the whole year will be approaching a hundred thousand in the Serlachius museums this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40 000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds that new museums are phenomena whenever they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue well into the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the art museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday evening, a window was broken into the commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck's tank.
On the other hand, a boat with outboard motors had been taken from the Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was light on the outside of the Kalapalta brand and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the text "OIVA" was written on the side of the beak.
A couple of suspected thieves were already caught by the police.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a track and a man from Paltamo, who was in his twenties, was found hiding in the forest under a tree.
On Monday, police arrested another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine brought murder charges against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man and fired a shotgun at the owner of the apartment he suspected of being a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed the other man he was carrying the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which the party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a decision on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heatwave of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me
Henry was born into a family of migrants from Jamaica in Dudley, the Midlands, British territory, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19. The relationship between the boy and his father was distant.
Henry is currently rehearsing for the Rudy’s Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on a fictional conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap in the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he reflects a lot on his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Go! Move!
I'm looking at the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my dad and talked about, for example, the shape of a pint of beer or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal digestion in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although the working conditions are better today than at that time.
The melting plants are a bit brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot are plunging, and which remind me of the underwater.
The father used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he began to sing to himself as he washed the dirt from the smelter out of himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food for the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started to get sick a little before she died that we started repeating to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep repeating “I love you”?
Stop hugging it!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why aren't Dawn and I being friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a complete turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his transformation during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in the making of the theatre.
Next up were the Comedy of the Erhdys and August Wilson’s Fences.
Making the theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old.
A guy on the counter spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's career began in the mid-70's. “For quite a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV,” he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in stardom and being on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Henry’s manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Even though my position was strange and objectionable, I got to work on huge events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Still, “the award-winning, multi-year favourite and light entertainment show of British TV” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”
Henry worked in the 80's on another comedy series, where both the prank was made and the black British culture was admired.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90's, Henry was known for his character Gareth Blacklock as a comedy series called Chef!
The following decade, Henry spent the following decade with commercials, documentaries, TV series, and film parts, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, “What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems like you’re just pedaling in your place or walking on the side tracks.”
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series “What’s So Great About...?”
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare subject made me afraid.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it out.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You see words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had been missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
“This is what it’s all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was a success in the end.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it didn’t quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead role in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A small voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes on your own until the computer works again.’ ""
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the proposal would be continued as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and a part of me breathed a sigh of relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
“You are a part of the play, stay in your role”
Henry in the “Fences” play at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the play “Fences” was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; “This is what you need to do.”
This is what Henry says, of course, in a HOASTy voice.
I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: the little juveniles of humor constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one impression to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you're constantly thirsty for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general, it doesn't inspire me in the same way I used to.
I'm asking Henry if he's going to go on another stand-up tour.
It brings me real pleasure to sit together with the instructor, who will help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting –
It's really fun.
The story is constantly told, and I enjoy the task.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove ‘ghost workers’
Kenya has begun drafting a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who did not register in the register in the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid after they have left their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, wages and other financial irregularities of “ghost workers” cost at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left his official duties, BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the following weeks in the identification centers to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric form of registration, the government statement said.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
“This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as this will determine how many people actually work in their tasks. In addition, this will clear payroll at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of ‘ghost workers’,” says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the ministry responsible for decentralisation and planning.
The result for the financial year of Seinäjoki in 2015 may be in deficit of 25.5 million euros, unless the city adapts to its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual margin will be in deficit of approximately 9.4 million.
The possible means of enhancing the scope and level of services were compromised, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and subsidies of assets, and the increase in tax and payment income.
The 10 million euro of the investment qualification target is 8.5 million.
There will be no relief in the situation of municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient increase in tax revenue, increasing unemployment and a five per cent cut in central government transfers will further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategy-oriented goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals made to the management team for preparation.
The City Board's proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through the committee to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of ‘scheming’ against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots,” local media sources said.
Police did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior police officials were among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were in contact with last December's corruption investigations, which targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale criminal case and following phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister during that time) said the actions of the police were part of the planned action of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children go back to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took her daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn the lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally embroidered shirts for children, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Texas' Perry, the slanderous tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmed Twitter account posted a slanderous photo of the Democratic district attorney on Sunday night while he heard the accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent from my account without permission.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” the later post said.
Perry's backers did not immediately respond to the requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were posted from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a slanderous cartoon of Travis's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was on trial. Perry is the potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet read: “I don’t always drive drunk, three times more permissible... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was assigned to the position by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge responsible for the case to dismiss the accusations and said that the law on the basis of which the governor, who has been in Texas, is unclear in the context of the constitution.
Perry cut US$7.5 million in state subsidies to the government's unit responsible for the public inviolability, operating in Travis County and handling public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Mr Perry's decision prompted the left-leaning follow-up group to issue a formal complaint.
Perry's verified Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place in the Iowa election meeting during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to quit by posting a photo of himself jogging on the lake with the text “Here I come, South-Carolina!” on Twitter.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again “normal”
One of London’s most important developers has warned that the South-East England housing market has “returned” to normal activity levels.
London's housing has been plagued by huge demand and a sharp rise in prices, while fearing a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-level developer Berkeley, said on Monday that “since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of deals have returned to normal since the 2013 spike,” adding that this has enabled a “stable operating environment.”
The London housing market was doing well during the recession as foreign investors sought the capital by horde.
According to the Land Register, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of 423 000 pounds by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible “mansion tax” before the general election in May.
Last week, Foxtons, a London-based real estate agent, warned that the April mortgage report, which reported on stricter lending regulations, would lead to a lower market growth level in terms of both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate ager Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for London's real estate prices. According to it, prices will fall by three per cent because the index measuring the opinion of homeowners on prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of deals made in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter from a year ago, real estate agent WA Ellis said.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right-hand product in the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained lively.”
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April. This is almost a third more than at the time of the pre-economic crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax-counted profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus reaching 380 million pounds and increasing turnover by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley said Monday, prior to the company's annual meeting, that Berkeley's earnings for the year would meet the market's current expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is 450 million pounds.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold on the London Stock Exchange steadily for 23.96 pounds.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to be in possession of a hundred other stars leaked Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos online.
A Hunger Games star's spokesman confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "brazen invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will receive the accusations.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. Dozens of other female stars are alleged to be on the list of the other stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how many of the images are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
“For those who look at the pictures I took years ago in the privacy of my husband’s home: I hope you feel good,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon’s ‘iCarly’ and “Victorious” series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the photos and tweeted that “these so-called nudes of me are FAKE, don’t you understand.”
Let me put an end to this right from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images about the star.
Only an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel, which is about love and the letter J
They dissolved, it described what had happened best, gradually they detached from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only now and then did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps a little spiky.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was spiky, like a hedgehog.
The most recent victim of his spikes had been a relationship in the early stages, but it had been a promising one; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lone boredom, and it could perhaps have brought some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicate beauty with a joyful heart, a village of the north, which was even more barren and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern assumed was his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house that was located in a moist but paradise-like valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately the valley of Paradise.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden, which resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both absent-mindedly listening to the receiver, through which the whole country heard calming music and soothing news, when Ailinn's crossed, sun-tanned legs brought to Kevern's mind the song, which had been sung by a long-disobered black performer and
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually forbidden – they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, just like the word ‘word’.
Public opinion did what was achieved by laws and declarations: just as in the field of literature, people chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in terms of music they preferred ballads.
After a day of wildness, Kevern began to type the imaginary piano and sing the serenade to Ailinn's big feet with a cheeky comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
“It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter “J” could escape from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word starting with j and didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't that now either.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't exactly banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to the cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness performed through music.
Although Kevern had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailinn, it was likely that she did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted the principle of the principle that each group did the things inherent to it, gratefully, that they were saved by the trade of happiness.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribban ancestry are best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, those who came from the continent were naturally talented with electrical equipment, so it was their job to make sure that each family had a working phone that was used to take care of things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When THAT, WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of blazing flames and fearing that those flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning their lives
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung could have been dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe the bigfoots think.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
“Daddy thought it was amusing,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing else to see in the whole world except Ailinn's huge, crow's black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
“If you say so,” he said, but he didn’t sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really that big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said “I love you,” but it was still too early for that.
“I think you’re attractive because of your thick ankles,” he tried to make things right.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which the cruelty of the jokes could be controlled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair, and poured a receiver and spilled the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only of elderflowers, so he could not use it as the reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
“And your thick head is what attracts me to you,” he said.
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he'd hit?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the icy northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more devilish after what had happened, than their smuggler and disintegrator parents, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
A thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote of the insignificant love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, too, because sucking in itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him – just as his travel companion watched Kevern from the upstairs window – the man who was himself the cause of his hard life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He had an hour of compassion for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, bowed, shamed, defeated, who had lost all the will to fight – why did he feel that he was so familiar with that sight, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the newly described event, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in the Private Institution for the General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study on the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in those areas of the country where the reduction in violence, or even the end of violence, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy spent on erading it.
“A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done,” he wrote, “so that the natural aggression of the people who fought for and in most cases that have fought for thousands of years and won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where, despite the church towers that extend beyond the hedges, human gentleness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people cry over the sentimental ballads, devour stories of overcome adversity, and swear by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban communal areas in its relentless grip, and there is also evidence of a new kind of, more evil-sounded arguing in homes, workplaces, our streets, and even in playgrounds.
“You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I need to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to plead for his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Again, silence.
“I’m not asking,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I’m against atheism, lesbian sexuality, and feminism.
This workplace does not maintain prejudice.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is in itself perfectly acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, to what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church – and what you call cruelty or evil spirit, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Saying about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingon pink LED light proclaimed a guideline that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the word sung is better than written, but nothing beats love.
“I understand very well what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure his director had finished, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I worry that if we are not warned, we find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, though, we are not pouring our anger and distrust into others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “describing ‘mistakes’ the actions that our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say that they shed their ‘hate and distrust of others’.”
The person in your position should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about ‘us’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘other’.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
“If we are quite honest, in that chaos,” Esme ventured, “no group of society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it more – we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute the accusations, there is also no need to make adjustments, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is some way to make them.
But what is the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I’ll go through your report,” he said, expressing that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as “bad-spoken and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning strike; prime minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied stagging the attack to overthrow the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and took over government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said the army thus responded to a threat that came from “political fanatics.” Police are said to have tried to arm fanatics.
“The Lesotho Defense Forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, the South African Government's Speaker, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
“Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesothon Defense Forces all seem to be the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt,” he said.
According to Lesotho's military officials, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have been occurring in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the Grand Coalition.
He denied that he disregarded the government's power, although it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to establish data center in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has established a large data center in Uusimaa at a location that the company refuses to specify.
In a statement to Microsoft's media, the company said it did not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is a multi-hundred-million-dollar investment for Microsoft.
Oulu or Kajaani had previously been predicted to be a public place for the centre.
Microsoft will completely close its Oulu office, which will take the job away from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft's Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company would not comment on how many employees the new data center employs.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data center in Uusimaa.
Man charged with assaulting girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is accused of hitting a three-year-old girl at a traffic light junction in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of hitting a girl at an intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 carelessly and caused the girl's injuries.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around US$300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are waterproofly sealed.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the photos or video you want to take.
Some cameras or combinations of the camera and video camera have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions underwater.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others up to a depth of 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple pictures – many of them will fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple shots at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced.
If possible, stay close to the surface when photographing in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This way, you can also get more colors in your photos; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you can see.
Try to get close to the subject you're shooting.
This is important advice when photographing on land, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the photographer must be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill the entire image, including the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders, protesters swore revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election, despite the growing unrest that requires democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business world after activists begin planning and carrying out demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress will in practice give the Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was to be expected, but it’s still infuriating,” said Emily Lau, the leader of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People’s Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that standing as a general candidate when choosing the Hong Kong leader would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is administered from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, some of the region's largest and most prominent protests were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign, which advocates democracy, was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business world's block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was announced, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and they would bring about waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement released online, the organizers said the movement “sees the Occupy Central stunt as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance of dialogue has broken down and the taking of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures were tight near the government's main buildings. There were police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, restlessness is fueled by the feeling of many people slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten the Hong Kong lifeblood – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” said Legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
Such a picture would be bad for investing.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the henchmen of Western powers that stir up the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780 000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the region's largest pro-democratic demonstrations.
The U.S. Prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by setting up the UK's first luxury travel format for today's students.
In addition to a private jet, the company also offers other vehicles, such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in extremely loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIFs (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today's students with the easiest and highest quality possible transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, the reservations have not yet been received because the service has just been set up, but added that “students will start placing orders in the next few weeks.”
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay a tuition fee of 9 000 pounds.
In terms of their expectations and wishes, today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the higher education section of the organization, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority.”
Many of those starting their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, as the available financial subsidies in the form of loans and grants have lagged behind the staggering increase in the cost of basic living. Only the next step is to start thinking about where to find thousands to use for such a simple thing as arriving on campus.
Ipswich ‘swin house’ for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house for sale in Suffolk after realizing that a big pig is lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house, costing 120 000 pounds, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned its head on the sofa.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
“However, the photo ended up in the advertisement by accident, and it has since been deleted,” a company spokesperson said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as “a unique one-bedroom house.”
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it is still visible in the advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where questions have been asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
The departure of Spanish striker Fernando Torres from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea announced that they had signed a four-year contract with French front-line Loic Remy from QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is 13 million euros.
Torres, 30, will transfer to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record sum of 50 million pounds four years ago, but never lived up to expectations.
The decision was also made by Japanese player Shinji Kagawa's failed trip to Manchester United.
As expected, Kagawa will return to Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his transfer to ManU.
According to press reports, the purchase price is about 8 million euros.
Kagawa's new contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be Dortmund's husband again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment," Kagawa said.
Hertha of the second Bundesliga club Berlin is strengthened by Salomon Kalou.
The Ivory Coast national team striker will move to Hertha from French Lille, and the transfer amount is estimated at around 3 million euros.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played for Chelsea in 2006-12.

11 people were injured in the crash in the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday, four of them seriously injured.
Rescue workers were still searching for the survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but hopes of finding the survivors faded.
The preliminary cause of the explosion is suspected to be a gas leak.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so powerful that it trembled the buildings within a radius of more than a hundred meters.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so powerful that our ears were ringing," said Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash site.
Emergency accommodation was erected in a nearby school on Sunday for the residents of the building.

Bulgarian prison staff to hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the capital Sofia's Justice Ministry.
At a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to regain the old working regulations that were recently changed.
The salary increases are also due to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting between the prison workers' organisation and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, according to Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Directorate-General for the Implementation of the Judgments, told BNR.
The protest by the Prison Workers' Organization is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin was about to faint on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his pitch-black U.S. match and beat the blood of Ukraine's second half with his stagnant solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted on the field at the end, the encouragement was so great.
My eyes were blurred, I couldn't help it.
That noise and the white sea was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, spherical grabs, plates and tricks everywhere where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that everything worked out.
They come from somewhere, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu praised.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others were able to catch up with the plot.
It caught on the whole gang.
Salin is the team's happy pill and spirit creator, so it's no wonder that his example brought the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Championships after a 32-year break: The former reminded me of an outrageous refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It's been 32 years since Finland's men's national volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament as yesterday: it was a scorching match against France in the first group.
"In the match's decision balls, the refereeing game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost 2-3 of it, and after that the shit went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world champions, with the Polish World Cup going on on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average heights of the players have also increased.
The game is faster than before," Parkkali thought.
But what will happen in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the strain can be shared.
I expect Finland to advance from the first group.
Then it can be tight," Kosonen says.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a win-win match against Tunisia.
The current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder in the World Cup.
Let's hope that 17th place is now improved.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the national team's second coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö vented in the Tunisian match.
The sauna and evening devotion in Buenos Aires' Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

The finals of the Young Star singing competition were competed - no victory in South Karelia
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen, who reached the finals of the Young Star Song Contest, did not advance to the victory of the competition.

It accumulates good experience.
The finalists will record the songs of the competition.
The competition moments always leave great memories, Immonen says.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the praise"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dogs got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook post that a Cita dog on the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little further, but its legs just didn't carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help was received from the police, the nearby hotel or passers-by.
As the evening got dark, things were starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers came to the scene and were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdhøpiggen, and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain's slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message sent to Ilta-Sanomat.
Soon a German man came to the scene, who had a camping mattress with him.
From the mattress to Cita, we got the kind of stretchers where the injured dog was attached.
The German man came to the scene a moment after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope in his lap for a while, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but the carrying in difficult terrain went slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them once more.
The Soinis responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On the night of Monday, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - I heard that Cita is already feeling better!

A genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman was afraid of dying because of a wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth that she only had a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). It means a group of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK charity, a wrong diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe-skinning.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and die before reaching the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I could never skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I was walking and running differently than everyone else.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. During the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers saying that he was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and in a panicky state.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and that I would die before I turned 25, and in between, I would slowly lose my full ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “God, I don’t think you have this disease, because otherwise you’d be in a wheelchair.”
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was explained what CMT was, I thought I was being postponed,” he said.
Charity CMT UK organizes the CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
One hundred migrants found in a coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a coal-carried train, the country's Interior Ministry said on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Middle-Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3 000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a population of a couple of million on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled Syria's bloody civil war.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
The pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian newspaper, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will take place on 18 September.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for the Scots that only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, actress Sean Connery has given her support for independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scots to remain part of the UK.
In the polls, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
The difficulties of department stores continued in the middle of the summer - Domestic news - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline of the department store trade continued also in July, says the Finnish Grocery Trade Association.
According to the report, the turnover of department store and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than one year ago.
The sales of home and leisure products have been worst guaranteed, and their turnover fell by more than seven per cent year-on-year.
Dressing products also sold clearly weaker than the previous summer.
The value of retail sales of daily consumer goods, on the other hand, grew by nearly three per cent in July from the year before.
Sales grew most in small shops and large supermarkets.
During the first half of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent.
On the other hand, sales of daily consumer goods have increased by almost one per cent.

Areva has delivered an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima to TVO.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project have mainly been due to the fact that approval has been sought for the reactor's automation systems.

Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Bottas - worth about 60000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to the formula driver Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Villähti.
The municipal government showed a fair sporting spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the decision was made on the plot, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
Bottas' gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
The municipality will dismantle them this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are honored that she has enjoyed being her native and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has been to primary schools every year to talk about his sports career and life.
And hopefully it will continue, the mayor says.
The mayor estimates that the value of the beach plot is 40000-60000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has kept the successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World Javelin Throwing Champion Aki Parviainen and Aerobick's World Champion Tuuli Matinsalo received detached house plots from the municipality and built magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola and sold their properties and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved elsewhere when the life situation changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes Bottas will remain in his home municipality.
Hull hired striker Hernandez with a record amount of money
Premier League club Hull placed a record sum for the acquisition of Uruguayan national team man Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from the Italian club Palermo for 9.5 million pounds, or about 12 million euros.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo defeated Serie B and rose to the Italian league.
He has scored seven goals in 14 games for the Uruguayan national team.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games from switching to the pitch.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short period of time, said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal's national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian space test failed - gecos sent on sex trip killed
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia have died, according to the Russian Federation's space agency, Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geckos travelled with the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of gechatos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecatic eggs, for example.
The effects on geckos can be used to anticipate the impact of weightlessness on a person staying in a similar state for longer periods of time, the New Statesman illustrated in July.
Roscosmos said the time of death and the cause or cause of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers who were called "sex geckos" froze.
The surprise is also illustrated by the fact that the fruit flies travelling on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip effortlessly, and also got offspring.
France arrests terror suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old suspected of being the recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track the man down after he lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with the money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother, who lives in Istanbul, and alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told authorities that the family was not related to Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people who have attracted Iraq or Syria to wars also pose a security risk to France.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those on the books in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team's hopes for a place in the next round are at stake, with Finland facing Ukraine in their second World Cup match today.
If the opening defeat to the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary wins for the place.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter a quick guy, but we've played against them before and we have to get our normal defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than the United States in its defeat yesterday.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that we will see a normal pack of wolves on the field," Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged naked photos spread online - some confirmed as genuine
A series of nudes are circulating on the Internet, allegedly portraying well-known public figures.
Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "nude campaign."
The entertainment site TMZ has posted an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts (on the Internet) of Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted, the representatives threatened.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her spread are genuine.
She took these photos years ago with her husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy ailment was seen for this.
I sympathize with everyone who was a victim of hacking," he wrote, according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls the images in her own name faked.
Genuine or fake nudes are also on the move, at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final place of the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match illustrate the club's confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach for four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive errors in the first half, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the bad defensive play.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, which is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With the help of roulette, many young players have also had opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala snorted without naming any single player.
Honka's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed with Viitala to some extent.
"After the game, I said to certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player, and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately as their playmates change constantly.
This season, it has not been the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially on the defensive end, people have changed.
That's the main reason we're in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a series jumbo, tied with the second-to-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds of the Veikkausliiga left, so the Espoo residents still have time to avoid falling to Ykkönen.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop it now either.
We will definitely not be falling out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after a break of decades
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return as the creator of the TV series.
The Danish director is working on a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series project was announced by Louise Vesth, who produced Trier's films, today on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to a statement from the production company Zentropa, the filming of the series should begin in 2016.
Trier is reportedly focusing on the scriptwriting work of the series starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also announced in a press release by Trier's long-time partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his hard sales pitches.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Stake your breath," Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
He directed the Kingdom series for television in the 1990's.
01.09.2014 15:20 The retail chain Lidl seems to have won the Finns, at least if you believe in the profit figures.
The net sales of the Lidl Suomi Kommandititiyhtiö Group, which operates the Finnish trade group Lidl, continued to grow in the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company also increased its profit.
Profit before taxes reached 79.6 million euros, compared to 56.4 million euros a year earlier.
Turnover, in turn, swelled from 960 million euros to 1.2 billion euros.
The increase was 25%.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its operating profit from 61 million euros to 84 million euros.
The operating profit percentage was 7.1.
The financial year of the German-owned Lidl will last from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company says that it paid 13.7 million euros in tax to Finland for the financial year ended in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its store chain, has announced that it will invest 100 million euros in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4 000 people.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
From the Ice Bucket challenge participant's jaw dislocated
British Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken into care since she roared during the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared, I felt my jaw start to stiffen,” he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Perspective on the howling of wolves (kin): How can the increase in fan count be explained?
It was a great feeling today.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France in the Marouss ball sports hall in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about a hundred Finns who shouted noise in the other way, which attracts 20 000 spectators, otherwise to an empty hall.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup match in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the number of Finnish fans in Bilbao.
The 1995 European Championships were the search time for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by defeating Russia in a qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann lifted Möttölä to the final tournament team with the lime line.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, there were a little over a hundred Finns present.
That included journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish competition tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
Whatever the number is in between, it's an incomprehensible amount.
This is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys succeed in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Exercise Sociology.
Certainly, both Spain and the World Volleyball Championships in Poland are Finnish people looking for an experience.
A shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself must be attractive.
Itkonen makes the popular culture of sports a part.
It's a lower threshold to go to a sports competition than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses cannot be moved.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the Basketball Federation and the players to throw themselves into top-level sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were lifted to the pedestal.
The volleyball crew did the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top-level sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalistic support is, Itkonen reminds.
Can ball sports transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball is played for hundreds or slightly over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen considers the question to be a good one, and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
The second school believes that interest will shift.
The other is the one who doesn't want the sweets to be full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not of two interest.
It's a challenge for the socializers in the midst of the drug.
Confirmation of the plot of Bottas - almost 1.5 hectares from the shore of the lake
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas on the beachfront plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of the plot of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be built on the property.
Nastola has been following Bottas' success since his go-ahead.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in the area in demolition condition, of which the municipality will demolish six by the end of this year at a cost.
Bottas won his fourth podium in the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix this year.
He's fifth in the World Championships.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in the Villähte of his childhood.
He currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It introduces and tests them in the current U.S. in New York. Open tennis competition.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by the ball characters on the field, but amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players, also wears one.
According to him, the shirt will help him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given the exact time for the sale of the shirt, and it has not even hinted at the price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company that invests in smart clothes.
California-based Athos has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost a hundred dollars apiece and the required a central unit the size of a thumb costs two hundred dollars.
The techno clothes were also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds 1 000 dollars for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students from later years borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling the books straight away.
“My book of mathematics would normally have cost 180 dollars; I paid 10 dollars for its use for the whole semester, as well as a hefty sandwich,” said Schroeder, a 19-year-old studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester book would normally have cost 430 dollars.
Instead, he spent 120 dollars on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus books, the renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented books this spring, says Trevor Meyer, chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained for one third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s book “Calculus” is almost 290 dollars, but the book is available in the online store for specialty books at Chegg.com for 239.99 dollars.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and worn appearance.
For example, the “Calculus” book can be used in the Chegg.com online store for 93.49 dollars.
Matt Casaday, a student of the last year of Brigham Young University, 25 years old, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” used on Amazon.com for just 0.42 dollars.
The new book would have cost 48 dollars.
Ingrid Bracey, president of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% on the price of a new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the whole semester costs about 20 dollars.
Learn the rules of the renting company, such as notes, using a highlighter, and how to wear a highlighter, and the following fees.
Renter, be on your guard: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of regular papers may also be a question of a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the right to use the e-book is paid to its holder, for example, the Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookstores.
The Chegg store sells the book ‘Calculus’ as an e-book for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because several classics can be downloaded for free today, while science and engineering books can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing different sellers, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine's law school, recommends using the book ISBN to find out the price because it can be used to make sure you're looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure that the book is securely in stock, Gault says.
He learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from the university's bookstore.

Nearly twice the number of people killed in the fires last year
Nearly twice as many people have died in the fires this year compared to last year.
According to the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already been killed in the fires in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organization's statistics on fire deaths, the situation was last worse in 2009, when by the end of August, 64 people had died in fires.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other detached houses.
Spek reminds of the recap of home fire safety.
At least all home smoke alarms should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easily available for use.
All home premises must also have an accessible exit route.
Children should also be told which electrical appliances they can use when they are home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with the protesters, who had arrived all the way from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after being stranded in the Blue Mountains of Australia's New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives became concerned about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent to search for the youngsters, and the two were found around 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with the couple and were lifted to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital and were in stable condition.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks in the field.
According to a military spokesman, the gunfire of the opposing party has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel, which received artillery hits in the Asovan Sea off the coast of Southeast Ukraine yesterday, sank in the morning, according to the Border Patrol.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard had no certainty as to where the ship was shot from.
Separatists said on social media that they had shot from the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops must immediately retreat to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, an immediate ceasefire should be reached in the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our companies.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars.
Authorities said on Sunday that it could take time to ease the flood, even though it was predicted that the rains would cease on Monday.
The heavy rains surprised the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was issued for the rains in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rain front that affected the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French socialists should “be silent and help France,” Francois Hollande’s chief supporter said
Valls urged the deeply divided left to “like” its feelings for the troubled Socialist President, whose new government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our job is to stay by his side,” Valls said and deserved the applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace in France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite the new economic minister, Emmanuel Macron, a debate earlier this week, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
However, Attorney General Christiane Taubira caused a disagreement by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who expressed differing opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national front, mocked the socialists' constant division and said she did not believe that the new Walls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the last one did not last even for the summer.
“And the new government won’t last until the autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve the Parliament and considered it certain that his party would win the election in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the list in the EU elections in May.
According to a poll published on Sunday, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party could split into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the audience needs to quickly notice that the change is taking place,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka betrayed Good Morning Finland's presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka failed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Last Thursday, the Good Morning Finland programme published a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Morning Finland advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite right.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in her words when she tries to say the word budget session, and her freaking out also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose her money time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to run the live broadcast even tomorrow, says the Good Morning Finland Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10 000 times.
Jorma K, who worked in the photo office of Lehtikuva. Pouta, 68, finished third in the portrait category in 1972.
The image is of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Rakennusmestarit House in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture four to five feet away.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
From the look of Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was done with pictures of well-known people or events.
It's great that nowadays you can also succeed with other pictures, as long as you have an idea and visual twists.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 man-years.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation in information technology for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigations and legal proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be inspected on Saturday.
1999's idea of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the Women's Travel School in Pirkkala caused a food controversy on social media, Yle says on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old 15-year-old bulletin on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image that has spread on social media has prompted people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Services, tells Yle that the note that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there has once been such an idea that was discussed with health care at the time.
Each student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, pupils are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a doctor's or public health nurse's certificate of a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that vegetarian food experiments among young people may leave nutrition incomplete, and the absence of meat or chicken may arise wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to US$3 billion Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is in negotiations to acquire its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for three billion dollars. The information originates from people who are closely involved in the matter.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of US$6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to the sources, the information on the possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not bring results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations were not held in public.
Norwegian Cruise and representatives of Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and Apollo's representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when its revenue was US$2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also operating from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was US$1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The 29-billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
The companies are competing to become the number one option for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first stock issue on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 acquisition, which was worth US$850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's 20 per cent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP's share 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies account for 82 per cent of the cruise capacity in North America, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of the shares.
The City Board of Tampere will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Board will support the initiative firmly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become more common around the world that the grip of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal-protective nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be reached in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question about the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for the shutdown of dolphinarial activities.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a point to the deaths, close the dolphins prison and start to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than the stimulation-free concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The aim of the Finnish Animal Welfare Association Animalia is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support the requirement, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in the demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on 1.9.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphinaries or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on the new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “state-likeness” of the region, Russian news sources said.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, ruled by the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners for the Kiev government corresponds to his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which allows it to go to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to recapture the separatist-dominated region of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which separatists captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region as the “Novorossiya”, the “New Russia” – this term resembles the glory days that preceded the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are “an illusion” for as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
“We need to immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of southeastern Ukraine. This takes into account the interests of the people who live there,” he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “state-likeness” is related to the wider independence that has been discussed for months with the Kyiv leadership as it tries to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There can be no discussions on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine.”
A Kremlin representative’s interlude, aimed at correcting the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s comments, emphasized that the Russian regime is dealing with the revolt of the separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in Crimea, when it practically captured a region of 2 million people of the population of which is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that unites Russia in Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main fleet of Russia, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historical coastal sites.
The area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia also has mines, factories and metal digestions that produce products that are vital for the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on June 7, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers – after the new elections – consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of regions deviating from the core region of Ukraine on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and Moscow's perhaps armed and incitement separatists.
Putin made his latest call to the Kyiv government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed city of separatist Novoazovsk is the beginning of a greater effort to capture the entire strategically significant coastal area of Crimea.
It has led to the massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. With a population of half a million, Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, calling for further action to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point from which there is no turning back,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed further sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine resurfaces in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their position in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armoured detachments and 1 000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers besieged by Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced by 10 Russian skydivers who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese scorer Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, first Sulley Muntari and a little later Jeremy Menez scored from the penalty spot.
Lazio also scored in the closing moments of the game, but goaltender Diego Lopez blocked Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan from Real Madrid this season.
Milan's former striker icon Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The number of spectators in the match was reported to be 39 000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been shocked by hackers after his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko's nude photos.
The entertainment world has been busy since Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos were posted on the Internet as a result of the extensive celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of the Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list includes 101 celebrity names.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "this is disgusting."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as “shameful” and said that the victims “feel disgraced.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merit includes the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence’s spokesman told TMZ that “it’s a brazen invasion of privacy.”
Actress Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in a tweet: “The publication of photos stolen from a cell phone is in no way different from selling a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a purely legal point of view.
