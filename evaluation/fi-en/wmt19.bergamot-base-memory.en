Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane to a home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who was in the men's volleyball championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the Hurricane's most effective with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then came a call from Loimaa.
We managed to get things done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, supported Koukia with 18 points.
The most effective of the visitors was the national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and that brought extra extras to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the medal streak is, of course, a goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most effective in Savo Volley with 18 points when the team defeated the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was fickle, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we managed to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charge when I was playing against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in Vieremä Volleyball in the 3rd season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere on the ceiling was always.
A good feeling was left over from the home opening.
Miro was the king, Silli played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Sampo in Pielavesi when Tuovinen was also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league in the 2012-13 season, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his first win of the season after knocking out the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well for me.
Today was, of course, a loss close by, as we were in the fourth round with a loss of 17-21.
We dug up a round win, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most effective chipper for the Tigers, who had still scored 28 points a few seasons ago, was the Edvarts Buivids.
The compatriot Alexander Kudryashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on a friend's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland in the comparison of human capital world number one
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, the educational level of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local play ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into great saves, and the Madrid team's local game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois made the save.
Courtois played three seasons on loan at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation (FIFA) chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale was traded due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goalie who moved to Juventus in the match.
U.S. Attacks On Right to Abortion - A Forced Documentary Explains Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected as one of the nine Supreme Court's nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh will be used to overturn the decision, known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern's and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and the Right to Abortion tells how the current situation has come in over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (blue) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received various degrees of support from the majority of the MPs in Finland.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is found, who, due to the extortion of the law, has remained the only doctor to perform abortions in the state of Missouri.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending U.S. religious freedom.
The news footage reminds of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a congression of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The interviewee's arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died from a self-made abortion is enough.
The number of deaths in the United States was around 5000 per year.
The legalization of abortion was advocated by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Abortion Law in California.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, who began to erectally confuse religion with politics to attract voters.
His successor, George Bush, was also swirling.
And Donald Trump did the same.
At the heart of the issue, the document reaches the groundwork for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations that advocated segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
The hobby horse was an abortion.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
At the time of writing, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who has boasted about sexual harassment but snatched the voices of the religious right with his position on abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court's candidate, which is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh could gain the power of 164 million American women and girls to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot and killed seven Palestinians, including two children at the border with large demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot and killed seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the dead include two children: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike on the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun the use of force so that the protesters do not break the border fence or aim for it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in the protests in Gaza since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people have been wounded.
The protesters demanded access to areas where Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped on Palestinian-seced kites and helium balls have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan topper Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him out with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was a problem for referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 victory.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
Work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the League Cup.
There's a five-win streak behind.
The auxiliary service for paedophiles was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40 000 experience interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint venture between the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, started to have an email flood and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference for children is a shame for many.
Most of those who notice paedophilic emotions themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that make them anxious and depressing.
They also make normal life more difficult, says sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Leaders of the Koreas or a Congolese gynecologist?
President of the United States Donald Trump, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites to win the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
The warming of the Korean relations is considerable, as the relationship was still chilly last year.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years and leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to those who participated in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo and have become the world's leading expert in their field.
With its work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terrible by-product of many conflicts.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there are 331 nominees.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he had a Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace award.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which concludes the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and the multipolar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 2000s, the award has been awarded to three U.S. politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
The awarding of Trump would therefore require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alarm in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in Lohja took place on 8 September.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off due to the notification in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department sought to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they are driving any way they can," Pasi Kääriäinen, Fire Chief on duty, told STT.
At that time, we even started to drive in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against the traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety's Liaison Manager.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must only stop for a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva reminds that in exceptional situations, it is not possible to start endangering traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be used as unobstructed as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially forbidden, as is making and reversing the u-turn.
The same prohibitions are also in force in tunnels, where you always have to turn on the headlights.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking, of course.
There have even been cases the other day where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activities in question," Heiskanen says in a statement.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught on the bottom of the lake from its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's commander at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and was caught at the bottom of the bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the accident.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them to the port with a fire department and take the bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch Ilves and HPK's match, which ended with a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's accident was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, the navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log drops, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible on the dark autumn evening.
No more notable collision
The Haveri took place on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait shortly after the shipping route had fallen below the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, getting caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and the cruises of the ship are expected to continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship was towed off from the shallows.
Just in case, we will go to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be taken care of as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department was alerted to the incident on Saturday night just after half past twelve.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call Fire Chief Matti Willman told late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced half past three on the night before Sunday that all of the people on board had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's candidate accused of harassment and drinking may be left without a top position
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well be left without the position he is seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person.
In the United States, it has occasionally occurred that the president's candidate for a Supreme Court justice has sparked a lot of contradictions.
In this case, the candidate for the judges has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
The president was able to keep his face.
The appointment would be made by the Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably rain down on the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional elections, according to Aaltola.
It would increase the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment is not an opportunity for every presidential term, as in the United States Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at the age of about 70-80 at the age of one.
Some Republicans have doubts about the nomination
The U.S. Supreme Court's candidates for judges are normally subject to a background check," Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a deadline of a week for the FBI's additional investigation, it may still bring up something essential.
It might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is certain that the suitability or inappropriate nature of Kavanaugh for the position will be discussed lively before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 vote in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be to take the nomination to the vote and the Republicans to lose.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisonings from Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said, based on the photographs, that it was Anatoly Chepiga, who works for the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously said they had uncovered one of the suspects in Chechepiga.
Even earlier, they said they had found evidence that the current identities of the men are cover-ups.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the Russian-China border, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the young Chepigan Bellingcat from the photos.
He identified the same man in pictures of the British police, which featured a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga was awarded the Russian Hero's Order of Honor in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
In an interview with Russian television in September, the suspects said in an interview with Russian television that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly as throwing bags in health and social services reform
Now we have a living example of what the change limit for the health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä Government means in practice.
My municipality of birth, Vaala's health and social services, are provided by the Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, whose health service director is the former Regional Director of Attendo, who was elected in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the council about the change limit.
If social welfare and health care expenditure now rises, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipal centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would end the institutional care of the health centre's inpatient ward and the small unit for people with memory disorders.
Home nursing care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages in Vaala will be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be "treated at home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay it for the customers.
Vaala's left did not swallow bad preparation, but organized a good public event, which included many relatives, practical nurses and also councillors of other parties.
I presented on the slides of the health and social services preparation, how the municipality of Vaala is already caring for the elderly at home the most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
The councillor of the neighboring municipality, Carina Läntinen, was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again lifted the draftsmen of Oulunkaari to their hind legs.
The draftsmen of the health and social services do not write on any of the papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty of residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell what level of care it receives or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the hospice care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the health centre's facilities are closed because there is no doctor's night-time emergency department.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example shows how centrist officials run the councillors with inadequate information and the delegates are put their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty the residents of Vaala, because who will stay there unsafe on a voluntary basis if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was it one of the center's election slogans that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is visiting the country, opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered by the Rhine River already in the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read in the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the surroundings for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep disagreements between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
The review surrounds the visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, canceled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said she had come to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three were charged with the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the published article by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karjalainen in sparsely populated areas on Sunday
Due to the printing fault, Sunday's Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution to the shared boxes must be carried out of memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bundles of newspapers in the county.
The newspapers of the rest of Finland's subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will today interview Vesa Heilala, among others, in his live discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about his upcoming space trip, which he booked with Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was 151 000 euros, and a bank loan was needed to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight that occurred in 2014, and even the victim of a death, things are on hold.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his journey takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, a Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also explains his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on TV.
Star Wars has been seen and that's what the idea was left...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City were a rude host
Manchester City continued their undefeated run in the Premier League when they defeated Brighton 2-0 on their home turf on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning champions' season was guaranteed by the goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth goal of the season from close range to an empty-net goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute from Brighton's back post.
Agüero increased his own goal balance to five when he sawed the Brighton defense to pieces with Sterling in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finals on the penalty spot easily.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, lead the Premier League with a 19-point lead.
However, Liverpool, who have played one less match, are just one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as the chairperson and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected as the Vice Chairman.
The council elected 40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Associations announced on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society Assembly, which is held in Joensuu, gives three promises in its three-year operating goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organize equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth Associations in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praises Kimi Räikkönen and amazed Ferrari: "Loses to a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton at the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen would not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian race.
Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas will start from pole position at 14 o'clock.
Iltalehti follows the race moment by moment.
The A-Youth Championship championship was a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The highest level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the round, which started at 13 o'clock, the starting points for the championship battle were clear: for FC Lahti Academy, a point against Vasa IFK is enough for first place.
In order to reverse the situation in the final round, Ilves, who are second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Lahti residents.
However, the Lahti-based championship was practically secured even before the kick-off whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasan, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-Youth Championship, the P20 series and the men's Kakkonen's Group C.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically all season against relegation.
In the final round of Kakkonen on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - the rescue service said luck was involved
A passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof on Eno on Juttuvaarantie, Finland, around 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue service said.
Good luck was included, the statement said.
The rescue service said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol was at the scene.
Supo is waiting for new ways to enquiry: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, no chips are being made about activities planned abroad
According to Antti Pelttari, Head of Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by making equipment purchases and training personnel.
When the intelligence laws enter into force, the Supo budget would permanently increase by about ten million euros.
The premises of the Security Police (Supo) located on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Pelttari, Head of Supo's National Coalition Party, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing topless campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is shrugging again.
Now she's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of herself singing her hands in front of her breasts, according to AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I recorded The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-attached [breast] checks," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a zone of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of skin color anywhere in the world.
Early perception is the a and o of everything - it will save many lives.
The co-author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was created in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
This is the case at the US Open three weeks ago.
Williams fired on the head referee of the match and claimed, among other things, that men are accepted for much more intense behavior than female players.
A Chinese restaurant on a mountain trail is not suitable for people with heights
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on the cliff.
If you wish, you can look at the forest below.
The rugged landscapes on the heights make restaurant visitors gasp in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers 19.9.2018.
In the Youtube comments, you wonder where the restaurant's toilet is located.
A hike to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things come to an end.
Today, for the Finnish country drama, it will happen to Korpela's alley race, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone like hot stones: last week, the episode was premiered by 722 000 Finns.
The top numbers in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirkku's relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska's mother is probably the first to guess what's to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, downright romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho once again appears in the picture.
The police are also skeptical of the sly man.
However, no one would anticipate Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear some amazing news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which puts a woman on the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings, Sorjonen will continue with new episodes.
Korpela's alley race today on TV1 at 21:05.
Should I go to work tomorrow with a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people can stay home or not.
However, it is worthwhile for a work mole to think about whether it is worthwhile to get infected with others, as the disease can be contagious, even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear sneaking.
In the latter option, you may already be infected with others, even if your own symptoms feel small, according to the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is already contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before the symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may be infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when your cough is easing and there is no more fever, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
A return to the gym too quickly slows down recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, squeeze into a handkerchief and throw the snot papers in the trash.
Hurt to move anyway?
If you have to leave your home when you're sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the tradition of miss: "My husband is a hockey player"
Hockey players and misses are often associated with each other.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown has been awarded to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
From his father's Russianness, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russian nature.
I had no friends in Pertunmaa at all, Alina says at the event of the Miss Finland semi-finalists.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start with a clean slate and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty of Miss found new friends and the everyday life started to roll as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri , who is familiar from the Pelicans' ranks.
Since his career in the Finnish Championship League, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a long-distance relationship for almost a year, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I were to make it to the winning trio and with that I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about the remote relationship is that the spark stays on all the time, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth's resilience.
Yet there is little to be given up.
Sustainable alternatives are sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of moderation collides with major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought a standard of living to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, from which only dreams could be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-running overrun of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change will make this market economy's cornerstone sway threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on the night before Sunday at Sitratori in Kannelmäki at four in the morning.
The man, born in 1986, was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, born in 1968, was less severely injured.
The older of the men has already been discharged from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incident.
The incidents are being investigated as an attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equalising goal against Inter gave the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the 1-1 draw in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right wing and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the away draw, the Mariehamners reached the difference to the Turku Ball Club in the place of the league qualifier to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Mariehamn's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said that the team did not, however, catch on to the battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goal brought us to the game more strongly.
According to home team Inter head coach John Allen, the game was in control, but scoring again caused pain.
One defensive error took us the full point pool, Allen regretted.
We were the best again!

Lehterä showed his underpowered skills, the position of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underpowered play came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final preseason game before the season started.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1 and Lehterä assisted Michael Raffl twice.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on the agenda due to suspicions of narcotics.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a narcotic drug skein where some are suspected of drug use and part of, for example, sales.
Lehterä has denied committing a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, said after the game that Lehterä is a member of the six-strike squad, five of whom will be replaced by the NHL.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second period, Lehterä fought the puck himself with an underpower, pulled the defender and fed Raffl in front of the goal.
The second time the duo's cooperation brought the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers will begin the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide whether he will be joining the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide whether I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who learned his hockey lesson in Jokipojit, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and made 20 saves.
Wild Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit on a power-play goal when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by defenseman Juuso Välimäki, who had an assist, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koskinen, among others.
Florida's Alexander Barkov played just over 20 minutes and assisted on a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara assisted on his team's consolation goal midway through the period when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
Joonas Korpisalo made 23/27 saves in the losing goal.
Already more than 180 000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the survey concerning the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time in the future has already collected more than 180 000 responses.
The survey, which was opened in the Otakantaa.fi service, can be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent photo shows a change: The world's strongest man lost dozens of pounds
Crowned the world's strongest man in 2017, Eddie Hall is undergoing a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall of the United Kingdom hunted for the title of the world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10 000 calories a day and weighed 200 kilograms at its largest, according to the Mirror.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing his body harm.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The Brit hunted for the victory of the world's strongest man competition by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen in the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition in April.
Hall recently posted a photo on Instagram of him posing in a much slimmer shape than his active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he trains five times a week aerobically.
The program includes, among other things, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, who is also known for the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Stuffily closed on the rocks"
The inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department was alerted to the waterborne accident on Friday evening after midnight.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted into the pits and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, said on-call Fire Chief Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
The rescue service said personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, said Jari Nieminen, the on-call manager, told STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, a ship that had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
On-call fire chief Matti Willman told earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The rescue service said the fate of the ship was unclear.
The ship apparently doesn't leak.
After the evacuation operation, the divers start to check what the situation is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an indoor waterway vessel serving as a restaurant ship, with a maximum number of passengers allowed for 180 people.
The ship also has a privately rented meeting room.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on a summons application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and his late-payment interest are charged a total of over 80 000 euros in unpaid managerial fees.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to try to reconcile, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti to tell the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastine, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services financially to Helenius in a difficult situation and promised that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they have arranged.
This is also a normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on paid work, and such would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in a message he has prepared.
No written agreement was ever reached on the cooperation.
According to the response, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not reach the draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was poor for him and broke off the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never had a fight with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "unindividual but extensive" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers the retrospective activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, the reply states.
Helenius will face Erkan Teperin, who is seventh in the IBF heavyweight challenger list in Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time radio host and journalist, died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The presenter's obituary was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement said that Pälli died on September 3.
He told about the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At the time, the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the acquaintance's fate.
He already said goodbye on Facebook earlier, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that Pälli was a liked person with fast wheezes and funny things.
I got to know Erkki as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
We met with Erkki then.
He was then Finnlevy's publicist and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular reporter at all parties to write stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight into the skin of the interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar with the prestigious Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
He interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärki at the Fazer record company in addition to journalist work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
However, Pälli's greatest passion was radio work, where he had a distinctive style.
He did radio work since the 1960's, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in the Yle Ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the Finnish Ski Association's financial year, which ended in May, showed a profit of approximately 450 000 euros.
The union describes the "full turn" of its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, burdened by "a significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning of operations and financial management have been embedded throughout our organization, Kulmala says in the press release.
We have also succeeded well in partner acquisition, and the World Cup performances were the maximum in the past competition season.
However, in the future, cost management must also be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershords.
One of the people in the hospital were the 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the Army Hospital, in Palu, was Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to Return's wedding.
I probably got squeezed under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told the AP, according to British media.
Small shops are being looted
At the Palu evacuation center, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as intense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many of the residents of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and buried the residents.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu's prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in the Donggala prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set fire to the prison after the guards had forbidden them to go in search of relatives who had suffered an earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first to land an army C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies, landed at the airport.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots will be forced to land at the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
The rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long precipitation area will spread across the country on Sunday night from the west, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain comes mostly in water, but in central and northern Lapland, sleet or snow is expected.
The feisty frosts of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures under control quite effectively.
In the very west, we can temporarily go to the frost side, said meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will recede in the east during the morning.
It's cloudy or semi-cloudy in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way to the height of Oulu in the stages of 10-13 degrees.
The coming week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in marine areas.
There will be no actual autumn storms to be expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be variable weather in the typical autumn.
The autumn is really starting to come out, Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final will not be shown on TV
From IL-TV, you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet in the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti's entertainment editors will broadcast the Miss Finland finals live on IL-TV from Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast will start around 18:50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in Billnäs ironworks in Raasepori.
Before the finals, you can watch the atmosphere on the spot on IL-TV's live broadcast.
The live broadcast will start around 18:30 and continue for about an hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the finals.
They are represented in the jury by the 1998 Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska's news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get into college before going to the Missing Games
The Russian father Dimitri and the Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland's Alina Voronkova, Dimitry Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments with the crown on.
They arrived at the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career as a miss.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty, she should become a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was that Alina would be admitted to the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This is what happened, and in the end Alina wanted to do a bachelor's degree before the miss competitions.
We already asked why he didn't participate last year, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing ice hockey in Japan for a living, and he didn't get to cheer his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between the young people lasts for a year.
Yes, that's the intention!
My parents hoped that the daughter would have time to visit soon.
Now I've had such a long break in the visits due to the missure.
I miss it, even though I've been sending messages.
Young man killed in hit-and-run in Lahti - police arrest three people
Police said three people were arrested.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentional nature of the hit-and-run, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the persons arrested and the man who died in the hit-and-run knew each other.
More information on the case is available at the beginning of next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mother in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organic nonsense once left my husband's statement, in which he suggested it as a person for the story I had developed, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger, a housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator in Brussels in economic and legal affairs until after her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what would you do when you grow up, when even the smallest child was already starting to be big.
Then in 2014 came a comic book.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had been reading Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
I had drawn last time as a child, but when these manuscripts of Organic Nonsense began to emerge, the situation changed.
At first I made some dozen manuscripts for the desk drawer.
My Daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I couldn't persuade him to come with me until the summer of 2016, when I gifted Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great supporter for him.
The canvas is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
The scripts pop up in my mind all the time, but usually I don't finish it at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and I like to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest part, because drawing isn't my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among others, from contemporary newspaper comics.
The organic nonsense is the carrot-body mother with the salad hair.
The other characters are Mies, Pissis and Gemini.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bun, even if something sticks in the Organic Nonsense sometimes.
Piippo says that he reads his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the comic you're drawing and say that this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewife!
The organic nonsense series can be read online at organichomppa.sarjakuvablogit.com
The lottery's millionaire jackpot was swelled - these were the right numbers

Indonesian earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave a cracked tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake is the 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake-shaken island.
The youngster was in the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the town of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before displaying the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify when the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured to be 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has honored Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn discussed on Yle's end of Europe's trade war: "We have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said on Yle's first morning that although the tightening tension has no direct impact on Europe's trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is so far a very talented man.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and also calmed the situation with China and Japan.
According to Rehn, Europe does not seem to be grinding into the footsteps of the trade war.
I'll have to check the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday to the Italian government's budget on Thursday evening to clearly present a deficit budget.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and there are more than ten per cent of the non-resorted loans.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country seems to once again exceed its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be worthwhile to paint new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in peace.
A contentious breakup would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his position in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has been glimpsed in the speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if there are Finnish names involved, Rehn said and added that he doesn't intend to comment on the matter any further than this.
HS's super popular Black Box performances will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
The other performances will be performed at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere's proposal is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and cinematographers on stage will tell a true story that they have been preparing for a long time, which has not been published in any of HS's media before.
There is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the world and an appealing story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the journalists and photographers of HS and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized living journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15 000 people have already visited the auditorium.
The black box was awarded as the journalistic act of the year at the Bonnier Awards.
The award winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring season 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance at the time has a different content than this autumn's evenings.
The missing mushroom picker was found thanks to "an unprejudiced experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is among the best in the world: "We are asked about trainings"
According to the rector of the Police University College, the police can use the drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the Rector of the Police University College, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, "with the help of an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also at the top of the world here".
The drone is a fairly new thing and even newer on police missions.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police are the masters of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clarified, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Is becoming more common
Himberg reminds that finding the missing person in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As mentioned, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are expected to be trained more.
Already, the drone is widely used in police duties, and their use will become more common and increasing in the future.
That’s what I’d dare say, Himberg said.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and certain kinds of reconnaissance missions.
For example, you already have to check an area a little further away, where you may be afraid that violence will be encountered there.
The drone can then be used for preliminary enquiry.
Karelian Rugby rose to the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2-division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuu residents were still halfway through the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and poked the southern guests 26-12.
The 2-division championship also meant a historic climb to Division 1 for Rugby of Karelia.
The club has previously played in first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby's league activities were divided into two levels, the Finnish Championship series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club plans to accept the place in the series, but that means quite a job next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the number of games to grow and longer game trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The head coach of the NHL, Claude Julien, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with three in the summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has played strong grips in September's practice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps forward after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts on the night of Thursday before next Thursday.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week, there has been a lot of talk in Finland about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, told about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and silence, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising risk-taking ability and agility disappeared.
During the week, a giant business event, the Nordic Business Forum, was also organised in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Messukeskus.
In addition to the star Barack Obama, 12 business stars took the stage.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, a legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader should have the courage to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods store chain, said the president should know how to communicate to the entire staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a book about the introverts in the book of success, said that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the life cycle phase of the company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to at the Nordic Business Forum by 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of information.
A good leader is required to do a lot.
That's why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes comradely.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for the outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrives on the stunning red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived to the missifinal in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a lace thigh.
I'm a little bit like jet lagia.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to LA for an audition.
Among other things, he has done advertising photography.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also the same as in Finland.
However, according to him, work must be done even harder, as the model for work is easily always replaced.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives 30 000 euro live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30 000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art award winner Lindfors works with choreography, communal activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work will allow others to work and create spaces for dialogue in the environments they have previously lacked, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, the winners were a group of international artists.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo in major operation: ‘We can’t tell you where’
The extensive search for the Danish police has paid off.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of Øresund and Iso-Belt.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlann were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The car found.
We can't yet tell you where the car was found," Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police told Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the searched black Volvo has no direct link to the threat, according to police.
He said the biggest danger is over.
Denmark's Ekstra Bladet told a police briefing Saturday.
Investigation Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was involved in the operation of the silence.
He didn't want to tell me what the crime title is under.
Skov, however, said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police won't say if they've been arrested yet.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the general public is no longer concerned about the threat to certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people are voting on the matter in the disputed elections
Macedonia, based in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name.
Under the Treaty of Macedonia and the Greek Governments, the name would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's attempts to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote began sluggishly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the name Republic of the Former Yugoslavia, the Republic of Macedonia, has been used on official occasions.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty to be nervous about whether the turnout will exceed the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a victory in the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the constitutional amendment.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at eight o'clock Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper in a professional boxing match in Germany late on Saturday night.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF Heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may have the opportunity to fight in tougher tasks on Saturday, the financial significance of which is considerable.
Helenius clinched the match in the eighth set, knocking Teper out with his hard left-handed blow.
Teper could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the ring.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded for injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had been snuffed out twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 fights from a professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who has become a clear favourite for the match, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with a team order to win - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One title was again approaching its confirmation, as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix and stretched his World Championship point lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel already to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started from pole position, drove second.
Bottas, who took the opening victory in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
The two assaulted a man from Juuka in Joensuu - caught at the end of the block
Two men were assaulted and kicked by a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 18 o'clock.
Police said the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
Police found the suspects, a 35-year-old man in July and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, to reach the end of the block shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been set to a 20-million-dollar fine for tweeting that he would have secured financing to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a 20 million euro fine if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach agreement on Nafta with the U.S.
Time threatens to run out in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline of Sunday, and negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
As a result of these timetables, the U.S.-Canada agreement text should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the U.S. Congress to assess it.
A neighbor thought that candles would be a fire in Kaakkuri - the fire brigade was called to the scene
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were called to the scene due to a possible fire in the apartment building.
It was found out that the candles burnt in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which is why the emergency services had been notified of the matter.
There was no fire at the scene.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawling at the airport and metro station
The police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo, the Detective Inspector of the Länsi-Uusimaa Police Department, Teemu Värtinen, confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was the protection against crime and disturbance.
The detainees were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The arrests were previously reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from the stands reserved for HJK's supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between the supporters of the teams.
To end the situation, it took, among other things, mounted police officers.
In addition to the field, the brawl took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant," Värtinen referred to the brawling in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal complaints have been filed as a result of the incidents.
Table stone blew the Butterfly's SE-time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Kivi have progressed to the finals on the closing day of the World Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The races will be held in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone beat Finland's record in the 50-metre butterfly, where he was second in the first round with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone swam in Helsinki during the SE time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus in Espoo, was 24th in the butterfly swimmer's time of 24.68.
Laukkanen of Swimming Club Vuokatti was sixth in the first round of the 50-meter breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the first round of the two hundred-metre mixed-up, Laukkanen was 15th in the 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: the tragedy of antiquity - the simple Oresteia has its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen the tragedy of antiquity, Sophocleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only play trilogy of the ancient, Aeskylos Oresteia, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat auki! projects, which started in 2015, the Theatre Academy's acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the bloodstore of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, meritoriously to an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir's shares.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuor's fine translation (2003).
The dramatic lights and the revealing display of the theatre space highlight the simple and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the performers who break away from the choir and the performers who play title roles.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and his spoils of war, Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, contrary to what was customary in the ancient tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern interpretation faithful to the text is created in front of the viewer's eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a group of master's acting students as a tight-knit group, downright one of the organisms.
Especially in the choir sections, the actors who are flexible in the very expressive, sculptural group formations come into their own on the bare, only decorated with a white curtain, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The novelty is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show by Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a thousand-car batch of new models for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching the fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue on the road signposted by the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cells as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first project of its kind, we will take fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area for these vehicles, for example, by monitoring the development of the refueling network," Hyundai Motor Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the launch of the contract.
The fists swung in Kajaani several times
A man in his 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed the other man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the abuser also struck him.
The police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man still behaved aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
He also threatened police with assault and killing.
He was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three counts of assault and violently resisting an official.
There was also another assault on Välikatu in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old man from Kajaani hit the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who had previously hit him kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers further away from the victim and the police called.
However, the perpetrators have already left before the police arrived.
The police ask witnesses to the incident to contact the Kajaani Police by phone +358 295 416 520 or by e-mail to Investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time radio host, has died
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-time journalist for Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going now.
The doctor has also said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I was first paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you get surprised by a topic on these annual rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail employees, I was surprised and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to the article Erika Kähärä, Workplace Specialist at the Finnish Service Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious are reported to the police, and many real situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies are obliged to compile statistics on their near misses based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain in internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In case of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw, when even aggressive threats of a certain level must be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were freed up, the media also showed a rather large squeal about its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At that time, quite a few employers provided security services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well under control due to security guarding, the impression was born that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security guard services.
Slight assault is a criminal offence against the plaintiffs, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same point of the law adopted in 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt of the store or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor's charges.
When the court puts a few of the abusers in jail, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society where a grocery store must be open in small towns almost day and night, must ensure the safety of the store's employees.
Heidi Sohlberg said to the misse before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
Miss's crowning will not be seen on TV in the traditional way this year, but the broadcast will be broadcast on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the co-host told the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harju a loud applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg praised his colleague as the audience cheered.
The front-row competitions are followed by many of the Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a small joke in the direction of either of them.
Sara, Iiro's married then!
Sohlberg chipped, looking at the Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he looked confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his divorce for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomat weekend newspaper.
The miss beauty said she didn't want to open up the reasons for the breakup in more detail in public, as it's between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry to have a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came to the fore at a later stage, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The co-demo here laughed at the mistake.
Iiro was married, right?
Janni Hussi said the mistake.
The Ostrobothnian man tortured his bound partner by slitting, burning and feeding the concentrated sauce
The Ostrobothnian District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola for numerous crimes against his partner to three years in prison.
The instrument of the offence was, among other things, a belt, a cable and cable ties.
The court sentenced the state to the forfeit.
The most charge was against the suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
The Kokkola resident was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of damage.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24 last.
At the end of the final acts, the man was taken into custody and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the Ostrobothnian District Court issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, the court dismissed these charges as indiscriminable.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public statement on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the defendant had committed violence, threats and coercion to his spouse in situations where he or she had been tied up.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed the strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By its judgment, the court ordered the state to be confiscated by criminal equipment: a belt and a cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a lumber.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the operative part of the sentence that a large part of the most aggravated acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old must pay his or her victim a total of 5800 euros for pain, aches, suffering and temporary inconvenience.
It is unlikely that he will have that money, because the convicted person already has debts in his debt collection.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
Iltalehti does not say the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent judgment is not final at the time of writing.
Europe with a four-point lead over the Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals on Saturday secured their lead in a traditional hole-playing match against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup 10-6 in Paris, with twelve two-time games to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles, the wins were tied 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they had played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
Previously, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the two will seek more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and neither have the Americans but three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns fierce harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football league team HJK issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at the FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
After the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Honka's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The ordinaries did not calm the situation down, but police officers and also mounted police were needed.
HJK says in a statement that the team's players and officials are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are sharply dismantled by any action that endangers the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to investigate factors that threaten safety and eliminate side effects.
The culture of supporters is part of football and important to HJK.
We support positive, cheerful and supportive activities in football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car - this avoids traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He's now one of the world-growing people who swear he invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has, for example, such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he glided his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: The industrial actions starting tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors, the bans on overtime and shift changes starting tomorrow will be reflected especially in social and health services and in children's day care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chair of JHL.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly be visible in such a way that there will not be enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how they are picking up their children.
The employer's task now is to ensure that the services are working and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL's members were banned from overtime and shift changes due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff have not been hired, but that the employees have been left overtime or changed shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing to take care of regular working hours for each employee and only make them.
JHL opposes the Government's intention to reduce the protection against dismissal of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director for Municipal Employers, will not begin to assess the effects of bans on overtime and shift changes.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so vast, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly from industry to industry, region and employer," Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience of the similar three-day activities of the Union of Practical Nurses and Basic Nurses Super and the Trade Union for Social and Health Care Tehy.
Their effects were quite minor.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift changes applies to employees of municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health care sector, among others.
For example, childminders are excluded.
The industrial action concerns almost 100 000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Termination Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is a wall and hard.
According to Jalonen, both the trade union movement and the government must come up against.
What's special about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the presentation hasn't been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the performance's fitness circles study the gestures of a ray and a seahorse
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Spaces collective premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer-limited presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a fairy-tale magic for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children make in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of fairy tale ballet, fitness circle and nature-themed information, but it is finally tuned around visits in other, non-humane states.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the movement paths of corals and coral reef organisms and fish.
In six different fitness circles, you will learn, for example, the gestures of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally, a performance lasting less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and glossy paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef is used both for diving people to observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are examined.
In addition, there are organisms that view corals.
The glances and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life-buzzing.
Whether it's the landscape of an organism, the organism that examines the landscape, and the other organism or landscape that examines the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult.
The Other Spaces group aims for the boundary between thinking and activities, which is challenging to get to when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitrator will hold a silent demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals.
Destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to comprehend the importance of practicing one's own compassion in the face of the vision of destruction.
In other spaces, it has built its work in such a way that it also respects the diversity of life with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of them, to whose wonder and play it clears space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that I didn't have smartphones in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at an all time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his sister's sister in fifth grade on the weekend from "boyfriend's."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram who are in their pictures with their makeup on and revealing their clothes on.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing photos.
It is even more difficult to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have any smartphones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and I didn't have to think about what other people think of me.
Authorities told the government that the incident was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Security Police and the Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airisto's Helmi investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reported.
The information from the anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalition Party).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else in this, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of national security has been found in the seized material so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way we can yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of the interviewees of Yle.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is just economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled a story that discusses allegations of both for and against.
Video: dream goal saves Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100 percent Premier League start came to an end, but was still a happier team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped with a 1-0 away win.
That's when the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City were now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great away win in Wednesday's League Cup from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was with us from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with the triangle game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the bet of the perfect left foot in the back corner.
Pool's brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his save and couldn't get anything but his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the losing position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's control from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa also got into action.
The Basque Guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the foot of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, on the other hand, reset Hazard's drive-through with his throwing.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino in his concentration.
However, the Brass star's butt was directed towards national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
That didn't last any more in the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the striker bombed an irresistible bet in the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the title fight two points behind the top.
In a clock-moving conversation, the foxholes are deep
I remember a few decades ago, a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one that stuck in mind: the Nen ending.
Some people's surname has a nen terminal and some have a no.
After all, dividing lines can be created anywhere, and here was one offer.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock shifting is being abandoned.
Very many people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been a fool's job and caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest phase of the solution, at least in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest part is now deciding what time of day will end up: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinion on the otakantaa.fi website.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is intensely held at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend the winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people's well-being, and summer time defends people's desire for outdoor activities and thus well-being with the influence of evening light.
Both positions have their strong supporters and good arguments.
According to studies, morning light rhythmizes a person's day and gives uprightness.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people's movement outdoors and give you better opportunities for autumnal yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for the class.
I'd rather have both, but we can't do anything about our place in the north corner of the Earth.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical for the discussion on the subject that one's own view is being advocated and the view of the other is strongly opposed.
The other side's arguments are not listened to, because the most important thing is how the matter feels about oneself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The topic is terribly easy to argue, because the matter does not require much dedication and the reasoning is enough for the mutu feel.
Similar types of things are usually disputed the most and equally fruitlessly.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think it'll adapt to that too.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close away win
Josba's first away game in Divari, floorball, produced a full three series points against Nurmo's Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for the journey home with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led by goal early in the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled the men in the chains.
At 50:47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi conspired to score a 6-5 victory.
With both teams on a penalty, decisive minutes were played in the even deficit.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second line at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
Next up is O2-Jyväskylä in the guests in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary celebrations
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in a partly very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Kiihtelysvaara Church a week ago was a shock.
The church was also guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place to celebrate.
Even if no one would want to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other joints of the world.
The family mass begins in Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we will move to the parish hall at the Karelian table.
There's a lot going on in the program all day, both indoors and outdoors.
For example, you can get to know the church building under the guidance of retired Ari Räsänen, who has served as the parish master for 37 years.
The birth of the Church also marks the end of one era.
The parish hall, which was already decommissioned in 1982, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in temporary premises at the former municipal hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in place for 200 years.
Elon Musk to step down as Tesla's chairman - Fraud charges agreed for 40 million dollars
Tesla, the company's chief executive, and Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk will be allowed to remain the CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors for three years.
The company has to hire an external chairman.
Musk will also be subject to stricter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk each pay 20 million dollars (about 17 million euros) to mediate the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and the inconvenience to Tesla's shareholders," said Steven Peikin, President of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it demanded that Musk be sentenced to a fine and he would be banned from running listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went down sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian quake and tsunami
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, the country's disaster agency said.
The death toll is expected to increase further, as the damage is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that took place in the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued for the tsunami, but was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known deaths are from Palus, at least for now.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for help from the ruins
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers seek the victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the area of destruction today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work without exhaustion day and night.
One of the focuss of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said that one person was able to dig up one person alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular among business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaugi, heavy clearing equipment would quickly be needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Please help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer pleaded in the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to deficiencies in the app's encryption.
The troublemakers had access to ministers' telephone numbers, among other things.
It was an app used at the British Conservative Party Congress.
For example, the Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, who advocated Brexit, were subjected to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the audience was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The audience accessed the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change the profile picture of Boris Johnson to a porn photo and title to be insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by typing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the logger can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every reporter, politician and participant phone number public, Foster criticized.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The UK's information agency, the ICO, is supporting the leak.
The application was created by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the Conservative Party for not being able to trust the Conservative Party on security issues.
Every week, the audience of The Wall Finland has a large number of applauding Poles
The sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The Wall, a rapidly spreading US format around the world, landed in Finland to Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are being produced.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-meter-high game wall in the format required space from the farm.
During the opening period, a studio audience for the program was highlighted on social media, which was bet on Polish.
There was a debate on Twitter about whether the Poles who are sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Finnish Programmes at Nelonen, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes players close to the players, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland and just Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international applause in Finland's production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you don't understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, for foreign-language speakers, the studio has interpreters who will take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events of the studio director as a simultaneous interpreter.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff and I recently acted in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He was constantly interviewed for simultaneous interpretation and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the photo shoot, Sormunen sums up.
The typhoon, which broke the south of Japan, is moving towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Trami, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the death toll so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Corporation, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off by more than 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka near noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the storm route, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami will plague Japan until Monday.
The aces' sky got darker
The early season of the aces has been bad.
The sky was almost pitch black, when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasan Sport on their home turf on Saturday.
The Pori residents now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points from six rounds.
No Aces defender or a player of the two lower chains has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the crowd disappeared from the hall already when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games are just over, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be concerned, because that's how poorly we played.
Especially the performance in the second period was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2 for Ässi, said.
Sport, of course, enjoyed the victory.
The team had a game underway from Friday, so you'd think it'd be visible.
Maybe it was visible, but the Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the number of audiences in the grandstand of the big hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe this year there wouldn't be this many people, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Kynnö Championships were organised at the same time as Leipäpäivä, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of audiences could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, things turned out otherwise; the corridors were already heavily blocked before ten, the sellers said that the products had run out, the number of news porridges sold more than before, and the number of cars, Hyvärinen, heard that there was a rise.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6000, says Hyvärinen later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon included a lot of activities for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of times.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will be reached from a further distance.
The vendors also bend to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived in the bread keeper.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the number of audiences from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread arrived for the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the Martha's pie workshop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book without tiring eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do a favor for your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more years are behind it.
With sufficient light, it is possible to help with problems that many people experience with age, when the accuracy of vision decreases and more people suffer from glare.
As we get older, the need for light also increases.
A person in their sixties needs three times more light than a twenty-something.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the caring effects of light and the properties of the luminaire already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniemi hints.
Creates beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can choose.
The popularity is gestureless, Scandinavian and Japanese-style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style of the 70's with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colors has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in the rest of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, we are now investing more in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, we want a tailor-made, even a bold lamp for our own home, which has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
You may not buy the latest trend lamp for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics hold their own year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the Canadian striker the door after three games
KooKoo and forward Brendan O'Donnell's roads are splitting.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games without a point in the Orange Blacks, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played for the KHL with Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods are going out into the world in recycling boxes, the plastic was changed to paper
In addition to games, Pelimies, a specialty store for games, is now recycling packaging materials.
The products of brick-and-mortar retail customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimies.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are planning to switch to recycled material even in envelopes.
The movement wants to lead by example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra hassle.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It also saves financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies' operations, as in addition to new products, the store's key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying everyone who is fashion-conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in any outfit.
They create a good garderobe foundation with their versatility, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics even at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes a black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with turtlenecks cannot be a mistake.
The clothing can be combined with straight trousers, a tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a discreet outfit and a flashy style around it.
The pool sweater is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trendy look is created by golden brown and wide-legged corduroy trousers, black turtlened sweater and grey ankle boots.
The classic turtleneck, together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish plaid skirt and the burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring an edge to the black turtleneck by combining it with casually trendy garments: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
The sabotage activities of the Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Foreign Intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or the military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this mode of operation.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the Soviet security service KGB in Western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, according to the KGB's West defecting archivist Vasily Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for DRG groups for the Bundeswehr, railways, game keepers and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, established inspection stations from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supply kits with mines, explosives, lighters and communication equipment for sabotage groups in the terrain.
In 1998, a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, whose trawl was exploded when it was sprayed by authorities with a water cannon.

HPK will hold Riska in the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, the sporting director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in the start-ups, underpowered play and the defending role of the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue at HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the start, the power play and the defensive role of the fourth field.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is a good idea for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, says Mika Toivola, the sports director of HPK, in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska will increase when playing the league's decision games.
Riska, a centre-back from Jakobstad, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Lukko and Sport.
Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
True story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experience.
Tonight's film is based on them.
Everest will now have its premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's guidance for 2015 is about a battle for survival, which has been handled grain.
The tragedy has been used to make films and documentaries before.
The real events are also discussed in this case.
The world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery performed before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost his sight, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall continued on and never came back.
Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When the man was found, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
Miraculously, however, he still got to his feet and found the others.
Weathers was thought to be still dying and once again left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility enough to be given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrated the 200-year-old Eno Church
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and to celebrate the anniversary, a family celebration was prepared for Sunday.
The celebrations started at 10 a.m. on Eno's church hill at the family mass, after which the Karelian banquet buffet has been served at Eno's parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family mass.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was happy that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time and give strength to work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire at Kiihtelysvaara Church has affected many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary celebration of the Eno parish.
Eno's church is now the oldest in Joensuu's Evangelical Lutheran congregations after the destruction of the Kiihtelysvaara church in a fire.
Kiihtelysvaara Wooden Church was completed in 1770.
In Kiihtelysvaara, a devotion was held in the morning, where the church, which was destroyed in a fire, was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean Hurricane, or medicane, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the areas of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The images taken from the region show a large number of floods across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows the sudden appearance of a river between the houses in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia region, rather than a street, due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car was transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, strong winds caused strong seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy advises you to follow the weather reports and the instructions of the local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings with it heavy rains and even the risk of flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medicans occur only once or twice a year in the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm, which is now blowing, left behind flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been raised in Greece by refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos.
The chances of getting to proper shelter are limited for thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps.
The storm will also be hit by areas destroyed by wildfires in the summer around Athens.
The medic was also raging in Greece last November.
We should not go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to leave branches or other bulk items flying on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to more than 3 500 Finns on holiday in Greece through Aurinkomatkat on the weekend.
The instructions will be needed, as even the Zorbas storm, which is reaching the number of monsters, is predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can reach up to 45 meters per second in gusts.
The wretched weather is increased by heavy rains.
According to the organisers, all those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland have been warned of strong winds by text message.
Still in the air, the sun and warmth
According to Inka Ikonen, a communications specialist for Aurinkomatkat, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we're monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety ahead is going.
Tui's media on-call operator Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he said on Saturday in the early evening.
The aid currently has a total of more than 1 500 Finnish passengers in the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers take a vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had also glimmered in Rhodes and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbas is estimated to be the next nuisance in Turkey, albeit slightly mitigated.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss have identical evening dresses in the final - this is how they reacted to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he bought the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The host, Shirly Karvinen, also wore exactly the same silver evening dress.
The two also noticed their identical outfits and took the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he had been in a hurry in preparation, and he had to get on a plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet host in the missifinal, and he talks to the front-row stars arriving.
Hussi has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Garfield's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - attracted the curious glances of pensioners
The presenter and the 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told that on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final, she had had plenty to do with radio hosts and Love Island Finland filming.
There has been a lot of hurry, even to the extent that Karvinen arrived to the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on my makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Evening dress change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says that he pulled out his makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Garlice flies to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days in Marbella at a time.
Karvinen says that he enjoyed his job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says that he went to see the singles on Friday.
It's really brutal in some way.
They are genuine feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example costumes
Classic clothes are garments that work from season to season in any outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes there is room for more modern individuals.
The over-knee boots that became the hit boots of the autumn and winter season a few years ago have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, boots that reach the knee are stylish from year to year and from season to season.
Impressive boots divide the opinions of users, but the bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-the-knee boots are actually suitable for any kind of outfit.
Whether it's jeans, lace, tulle or jersey, the simple leather or faux leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good both in the party look and in everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are well suited for even gentle outfits.
They balance the femininity of a pink, floral plicer skirt and a soft, plush sweater.
A fresh but stylish autumnal outfit for a romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, spectacular earrings and a staple small bag.
Although over-the-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear, together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars will start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo announces.
Otaniemi's robot cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area plans to start the traffic with a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Traffic Management Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars will be fully automatically transported among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger sitting on board.
The vehicles sense their surroundings with several different sensors all the time and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run the whole autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays at 13-15.30, on Wednesdays from 10 to 15 and on Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The stops of robot cars can be identified by stop markings.
The most secure way to get a ride is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
The bassist of the band Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of the gig and was injured
On their Facebook page, the band Mokoma announces the surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone concert.
The Mokoma band's gig at Tampere's Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was about to perform the last song of the night.
Hämäläinen's wrist was broken.
The band announces this on their Facebook page.
"I'm alive!"
Santtu stumbled from the stage yesterday at Pakkahuone in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish a quick recovery to the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done by deputy crew, the website reads.
Mokoma's fans respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist-Santtu is lying with a cast on the bed.
I've been waiting for this news, I was pretty worried about how bad it turned out.
The relief is great, the bones will fortunately heal over time.
Cheers and a quick recovery to Santtu and have a good tour for the rest of the band plus the substitute!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but do you promise to leave out such a strong drama from the end of the gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, wilderness contact persons of the Police Department reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting licence and a hunting permit required on state-owned land.
In addition, hunting gun possession permits and the permitted number of cartridges used in chicken birding were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found in connection with the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 daily fines for illegal hunting.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown away by police, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, the police once said.
In summary, hunters follow the hunting permit very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checks the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to supervise hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition Party) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps in Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects the candidate for a particularly vulnerable population.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressed position in refugee camps, for example, single-parent families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group of those coming to Finland than in the quota, because in practice some of them are not arrived for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, will also participate in the trip.
We talked about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970's.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but the government has not since reached an agreement to raise it.
The National Coalition Party has advocated a quota increase, but the project has last fallen to the resistance of the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) recently proposed gradually increasing the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit is the first visit during this government term that the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition Party) had time to move to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives 10 000 euros from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's get to the wrong way - you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically allowed by the decrees of ministries in connection with farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
In other words, everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals mentioned in the regulation separately.
If the bill ends up in law, it probably means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits action that endangers the security or good practice of society.
In principle, the prohibition of all activities for which the law or regulation does not grant a separate permit is now being laid down.
The amendment will mean that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations or do anything else until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The government's legislative drafting in general has been weak.
If we now get on the path that, in principle, in Finland, everything is forbidden, which is not allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But this kind of law project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it accepts such a "everything is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope that there will be a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of the autumn

Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere's lap
In the Karalahti family photo, the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia takes the focus.
Nanna Karalahti talks about the Aito kindergarten established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, were given a family boost in early July.

Turkey is advised to charge mobile phones in case of storm
The Zorba storm, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned especially the sailors, fishermen and farmers of the country's west coast about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reportedly moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
On Saturday, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functionality of the internet connection so that people can get up-to-date situational updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from the windows and to move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Greek Red Weather Warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies that organise trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow the weather forecasts and the instructions of the local authorities.
A while ago, when I contacted you, the wind was very strong and it was raining.
The people were quite calm," Laura Aaltonen, Communications Manager at Tui Travel Agency, told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday evening.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages about Finns in need.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected in air and shipping traffic.
Finnair announced on Saturday that the weather situation will be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too tough a piece in the time trial of the Russian Grand Prix.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not about a huge thing.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend for now, but they were just too fast, with fourth-placed teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen, clearly missed the Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we do - it's that simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably be going at the same speed as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
The time trial saw a rare treat for Räikkönen's future team Sauber.
Next season, Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen at Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session, as many as five drivers did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were in the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper on the Stuttgart night progressed evenly.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he didn't get a decent hit.
Clearly more reaching, Helenius controlled the match with his tough series, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The decision finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderate.
In the ring interview, he first praised the good mood and opponent created by the audience.
He then changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius' career.
It might even be possible to get into a World Cup match, Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
The defeat, on the other hand, might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has crossed my mind.
This isn't going to get any younger," Helenius, 34, admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is urging that the death toll rise will be clearly raised.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the city of Palu and the neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, the situation in Dongglaa is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the screams of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to carry out rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
The Miss Finland finalist's hesitating response and long reflection caused a laughings
Billnäs' Ruukki is currently selecting the new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, a question was asked to each missi-finalist.
The finalists drew a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
The hesitant response of the finalist number six, 23, caused a sweet but benevolent laugh in the audience.
The question asked to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book the missi-finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before starting with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said, thinking.
The period of reflection caused a laugh in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school.
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is economics someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the miss tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, as he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21:00, when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up the crown.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples of their own, because the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
I might have to buy a pear, even though I think quite a few are already growing the pear tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if you also invest in the cake with its pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seeds.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar until foamy, then add the cornflour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the corn starch, i.e. maizena and baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread tin with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and the apple wedges on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple wedges.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in the pan, then pour into the serving dish.
Cut the cake properly when cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crumbles because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January
For the first time in January, an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held in Ruka, Kuusamo.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related programme numbers and jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include the Swedish detective literature star Jens Lapidus and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who is behind the writer name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature author guests from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a setting for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two species of "cooliness" consisting of slightly different features: generally charming coolness and partly opposite dissident coolness.
According to the researchers' description, the charmingly cool people had many features that were considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, friendly, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They thirsted for experience and ignored the reviews of outsiders.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is not cool in the long run: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought good-looking people and sought the popularity of others, had an increased risk of using intoxicants and getting into crime.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once unobtrusive peers.
Luxury cars, branded bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least not a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a regular supermarket shirt than with those dressed in a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people chose a branded shirt in the event of a visit.
If you're on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
There's a hurricane hitting it - a weather warning screams red
During the weekend, it may rain as much in southern Greece as in Finland on average in the six-month period.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for this if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek meteorological service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm that beat Finland in the beginning of the week was at its highest, blowing at its highest, just over 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water could come in southern Greece.
That's about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's drooled Love Island Finland Anku?
Appears on confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beauty Anku, drooled over several men, also appears on strange Youtube videos released in 2010 as craft aunts.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make an octopus out of an old roll of paper towels.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can make a hedgehog from tights, which grows the right spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grasses grow, but let's do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints and introduces sawdust, tights and rainbow seeds, from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more minutes after his pole position race in the Russian Grand Prix, when he was in front of the media.
The great lap left behind Mercedes' first-place star Lewis Hamilton and was mentally certainly important for the Finnish driver who had gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit," Bottas explained.
I've only been on the pile once this year, in Austria (in the middle of the summer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good laps again.
It's not easy to overtake on the Sochi track, so the start is in a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas got to answer the question, will he drive tomorrow for the win or whether he's going to be helping Hamilton, who is approaching the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely pleased with Bottas' success after the race, and the Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted good.
Lewis had a plan to win Valtteri, but he didn't make it to the sevens corner.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everyone away from himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was bursting out of his ears, Wolff said.
To the question of whether the team will let Bottas and Hamilton drive honestly, Wolff replied, dodging.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitee-based Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship ended rarely.
The brothers have hardly ever ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kitee-based Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final was sealed for him by the Finnish championship in the two-wheel drive SM4 class.
Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä, who competed in the Honda Civic, started the Turku race with restraint, because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give a handicap when some of the additional lights failed on the second special stage.
It was a bit blinded by a third snippet.
In a situation like that, you can't relax.
On Saturday, only Jussi Teppo, who was second in the series, followed the pace, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syria's foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against the terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallen also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
However, there is no end to the war that has lasted for seven years.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Germany on Friday that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, which would be attended by the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judges' drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who is running for the Supreme Court, got an extraordinary number of people to the screens.
The U.S. Supreme Court's nomination drama received at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor of California accusing him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online hearing was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had set a one-year record with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN's figure rises above 10 million when it comes to those who have followed the broadcast through YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also launched 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are the channels' own, the TV viewership figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be dizzying anyway.
Few people reach 20 million
In the United States, the audience of more than 20 million is usually only sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammy Awards in the world of entertainment, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
The U.S.'s most watched program, the U.S. Football League's NFL Finals Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, nearly 48 million people watched Trump's first speech to Congress and more than 30 million people attended inauguration.
A very important thing
The Supreme Court's nomination of judges is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent the then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called scale language on several issues, the voice of which could decide the position of a nine-member court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, with his vote, he decided that same-sex couples had the right to marry in the entire federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock down the right to conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to be informed by parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Initially, the situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying than this: the parents did not get to look at even the health information or recipes of the little ones.
The temporary correction to the situation was made in autumn 2016 for under 10-year-olds.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazingly long time to repair.
Now the repair is on the way - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a shout-out.
After that, with the understanding of the layman, it is a matter of pressing a button: now that the wire is closed, let's open it.
Of course, the child can show their information to their parents - if they have bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is subject to a charge, and the 10-year-old does not even receive the bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of the elementary school's fourth grader except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much about the right of parents as about the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that the parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations in which not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which care free is a deeply meaningful human right.
In the United States, the FBI began gutting off harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
Earlier this week, one of the women was heard by the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not last longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than criminal investigations, and it may not become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The caught brawler continued to bulge even in the chamber.
Police say they put the man in a police prison to "calm down."
Police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities announce a case that started when a 30-year-old man fiercely challenged a dispute in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the restaurant.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, he also hit him.
The triple assault led to the police calling.
The patrol arrested the man and took him to the Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect was still behaving aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another officer in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they sent the man to a police prison to "calm down."
The man is suspected of three counts of assault and violently resisting an official.
Grant groups are preparing to start work on Indonesia's Sulawesi - "Pure water is the most urgent"
UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Agency, and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF Finland.
The local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency aid capability, says Haru.
The first task is now to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue operations are underway in the town of Palu in Sulawes, but in the Dongglala region, slightly further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawesi, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing that can be used to provide people with water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, the water is transported in the first place, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and reunifying families is one part of UNICEF's mission field.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
Initially, the previously collected funds will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started a fundraising to help Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami victims.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla's board of directors for 20 million dollars in tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of the companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, will avoid fraud charges by agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Elon Musk, billionaire, will end his post as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a 20 million dollar fine.
Musk resigns as part of a contract he signed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which prompted the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as Tesla's board of directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and take two "independent leaders" on their management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of 20 million dollars, the Tesla company will also have to pay the corresponding fines of 20 million to the financial regulator.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured financing that would have made Tesla buy back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a price of 420 dollars.
Tesla's share price rose more than ten percent in a day after tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim on the funding.
He also had not discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped 14 percent when the Securities Supervisory Authority SEC reported a fraud charge.
The agreement on the news is expected to reaffirm the company's course.
The final sentence is not the reason
Naturally, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical fault.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The hands point to twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: when the church's crypt would be exorcised and the organ would sound to itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped due to a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some part has broken and a new part is expected to be involved, says suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account mentions that the final judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the church bells do not ring due to fault.
