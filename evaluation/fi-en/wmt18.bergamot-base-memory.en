Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's making art on the subject - "A person should have the right to their own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts' Project room gallery.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story about how outside people have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By process, he refers to the gender reassignment process.
It is often a year-long study period that includes appointments with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be initiated with a referral for "gender identity disorder" ­diagnosing studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In Auer's case, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the internet and was also very far along in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the gender can also be corrected legally.
The Trans Act, i.e. the Act on the Confirmation of the Transsexual Gender (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to undergo forced sterilisation in order to get the right gender to the Population Register Centre and passports, for example.
Currently, a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility are required for each gender-remedial.
A person has the right to control their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the Act and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to observe the right to self-determination.
Finland's previous government prepared a legislative amendment under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections and the Finns Party entered the government.
The change in the law is back to be stuck.
It is a matter of domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table, because there are disagreements within the board about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International's Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the drugs used by Auer.
In the patient record installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpol psychologist of Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and wrote a report based on these, which would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The study's sense of reality appears to be vulnerable to faltering.
The researcher's perception of himself or herself appears in a boundary-level manner fragmented, and the unstable traits related to personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
It was an even greater shock when Auer was not granted gender reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
That's February 11, 2015, ­Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the TV in the transpol waiting lobby.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was born on that television, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and how to use it.
"It's crazy that anyone at birth as a woman can enlarge their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove your breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything other than the number of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience isn't the only one of its kind.
The gender reassignment process is harder for many for mental reasons than purely because of medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified of their own existence and their right to their own gender experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment, claiming that their resources aren't enough," Auer says.
Many people who have sought the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On the basis of these, the medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, it got easier.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed since childhood and teenage years.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into your own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using voice and movements," she says.
Today, Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when your loved ones abuse you.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't agree or can't internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, that is, body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, you cannot get official confirmation of your own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal gender.
The adult applicant submits a written application for the new personal identity code, stating that they feel that they are of the other sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement also sums up Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 at the Academy of Fine Arts' Project Room.
Civil rights organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, a national civil rights organisation for African-Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouri. This is due to the state’s discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that took place there.
“NAACP’s travel advisory for Missouri will come into force on 28.8.2017 and urges African-American tourists, visitors, and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where numerous questionable racial-based events have occurred recently,” the association said in a statement.
The law, which recently came into force in Missouri, makes it difficult to take discrimination cases to court. In addition, the implementation of state laws is disproportionately targeted at minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They are stopped based on their skin color and abused or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never heard of such a few incidents in such a short time.”
The Missouri travel advisory is the organization's first warning about the U.S. state.
The organization cited as examples racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
A travel bulletin also referred to a report by the Missouri Attorney General that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
“The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be on their guard and warn their families, friends, and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay guarantees or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth most of the U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, a constitutionalist organization, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and apply to other countries. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Centre Party), who is responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair to provide a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the minister, it contradicts the state's statement of intent.
The 130 000 euro supplementary pension received by Vauramo came up this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on ownership steering.
The sanctions immediately increased the speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in connection with the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the mood has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions that were approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted to bitterly in Russia.
The most stunning response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means "a full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian reactions were only offset by the escalations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of faith after the election of Trump.
In the United States, the implementation of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
The Congress approved the law with considerable consensus, but the approval of the law was considerably more difficult for the president.
Trump criticized the bill he recently signed as "significantly inadequate."
President Trump's snarl may have been the reason for Russia's, although the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must also have been disgusting.
As is well known, there is an investigation into the United States, both in Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and in the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As White House staff have changed frequently and various scandalous twists have been almost revealed, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the president's leadership, but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is complicated in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core area of the Baltic Sea is also straining relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state that trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU fears that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, the US economy has been excluded from the sanctions, for example, the important liquid natural gas lng.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics a means of showing disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well-thought-out and sacrificial.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now aiming for the Statue of Liberty
Intervening in the statues is the surest sign of a transition of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologues of the Trump administration, knew very well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word-wrong-willing proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller berated Acosta: “I don’t want to go into history right now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller wasn't wrong in himself, but it's not just history, as he said himself.
The only things that matter are Lazarus’s touching words, the only ones of its kind in which the state calls not only immigrants but “the poorest of the poor”: “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched of your teeming shore.”
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism. He made it clear that “the poorest of the poor” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The dispute over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned to attach the poem to the base of the statue. They knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
To attach the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouth-watering player who can now be considered a sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not make an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives who take the torch of the United States into a world covered in darkness: “Lady Liberty comes forward.
He takes the freedom torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their torch does not show the way, but incites the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
Athletics World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the head of the UK Athletics Federation, says 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are a “significant confirmation.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics in London on Friday.
According to Black, Scotland “has something special happening” that UK athletics must learn from.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it for so long that we understand what it is all about,” Black said.
“I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the Federation's activities,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And the average streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s something great, whatever it is.”
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m race. Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the national team.
“Eilidh is too modest.
His captain’s speech was incredible,” Black said.
“Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medallist in the 400 metres hurdles, and their fifth World Championships. He said it was “unbelievable” to have 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was set in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London in the 1 500 meters and 5 000 meters.
Chris O’Hare runs 1,500 meters in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: he has an excellent season behind him, including wins in the UK World Cup qualifiers and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is “hugely proud” of the fact that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
“Being captained is a great honour anyway, but it’s even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scots that made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for podiums.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic politics, all the way to his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism annoyed,
But he did not silence his critics.
“If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights League sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also dismissive online.
“What does it matter? This is just Facebook,” a lot of people commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the astonishingly popular Republican governor of the state.
He has received the second best ratings among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive hothead.
He has led the state steadily and held on tight to the principles.
He has also competently used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and there posted a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax revenue.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post. He said it was just a matter of moderating the comments.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders of their choice. They were not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and matter-of-fact.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma from Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not commented on the hate crime and other recent news,” he wrote in a statement.
“Nor can I accept the fact that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor’s staff called the comments a “centralized attack.” Someone else might call them to promote what is considered important.
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It’s really the same thing, now it’s just digital.
Hogan is not the first public officeholder to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
James C., Judge of the Alexandria District Court. According to Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights League spoke with Kentucky's Republican Governor, Matt Bevin, about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's time, inexpensive postage had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers hammered Washington.
Even then, there were trolls.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers calling out Washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, i.e. the U.S.-UK cooperation, trade and maritime agreement. This is evident from the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
It is advisable to stop feeding the birds immediately
There have been samples from about half a dozen places, and online advertisements about a couple, three.
Most of them came from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individuals from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The greenfinches have died from a parasite called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially pigeons.
In the 2000's, however, the disease was also detected in the finches.
In 2009, it really worked out.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have been sick greenfinches, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of the Finnish Museum of Natural History at the University of Helsinki (Luomus).
It is to be feared that the previous epidemic of greenfinches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-court advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home advantage for the next three days, with the Renaissance Club in East-Lothian running 25. The Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Ireland's Rafferty led the tournament on the neighboring Archerfield Links last year, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is in a new place and is the ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will be filled with its glory,” Rafferty says.
“Players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an avid ambassador for the game, and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
The tournament is a great show for this field.”
Eales defends the title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
“This feels like a really special opportunity,” the player at Southport says.
“I didn’t get to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: winning a tournament was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember.”
Gary Orr will return to action on his own soil. He joined the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and playing pretty hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge. Parking a car costs five pounds if the car has only a driver, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's Relay Company, at least for the time being, the brigade was announced on Thursday.
Indoor air research continues.
The investigations began when a man who had interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated incident, and the other people who served in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to find out this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that due to the arrival batch in July, goods have had to be transferred to the barracks, which has allowed the dust to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of that, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove in cooking.
He rarely uses a pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “nota” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the carve is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There's no furniture in Degei's home. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as laundry in turbid water from a nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet is provided by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and she has not been assigned to take care of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, the soldiers must be taken into account.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The merger was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger at the Jakarta government, which keeps the region firmly under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is remote and dead. The journey there begins with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19 000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated tin roofs of which have stained yellowish-brown.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
“We didn’t have clothes like this,” Degei said. He means his colourful, hand-woven wrap-and-writting hat, dark skirt and brightly coloured sweater.
“We used to have only leaves covered our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
Paniai is a highland of about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153 000. Only about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced 3.1 billion dollars worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollar wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local units in the military nearly 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to 150 000 dollars.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income, and they are silenced mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papuans since 1969 and raped, tortured and captured thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Papuan Tribal Highlands in the 1970s took on the proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the area.
The Brisbane Archdiocese Report We Will Lose Everything 2016 contains reports of the previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and from relentless attacks towards peaceful protests.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because there are cases every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch in Indonesia.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 per cent are Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslims are moving to the region from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi for a better livelihood.
The Javans' warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
“Movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a lower price than the locals,” said 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital for work.
“Local women lost their clients.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 areas, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 districts, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our hopes and restore justice,” You said.
Paniai experienced some kind of wave base just two months after the inauguration of Jokow in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the campfire in Enarotal on 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should be using headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. Local pastor Yavedt Tebai said the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the stories of the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers apprehended the children and beat them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, a building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered on the football field in front of a local police station and army command center to demand justice.
They were carrying hunting bows for celebrations, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in a ring and imitate birdsong.
Some of the protesters began to stone the buildings of the police and the army.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were ordered by the internal radio system: “If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death.” The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been made public to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, anticipated that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house, which was painted brightly.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
“A number of shots were fired in the crowd.”
Alfius Youwi was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” Yohanes told TIME magazine, sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were just “protecting” the police station because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The next day, information about the killings took place in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing like this will ever happen again.”
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his speeches.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990's and early 2000's.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed for that,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he wasn't going to start investigations in Papua.
“Everything will be dealt with in court,” he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of “crimes against humanity.” The crimes relate to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence referendum of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have already been investigated, including the events of Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai are darkly incredulous about the claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the past three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” Yohanes says.
“I’m tired of this.”
He says he still lives in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
“I’m scared,” he said.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me. I’m afraid I’m going to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He said the soldiers had assaulted him after he helped bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers were looking for me after the victims were buried,” he said.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot and killed villagers in the neighboring Paniai district of Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the construction company's manager, which began when the manager refused to take the man who lost his consciousness to the hospital. There were also children among the injured.
The man who needed the hospital was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the police, who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one of the villagers.
“We are terrified. We’re afraid of revenge,” said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers who fired the shots to be held accountable and the mobile police unit pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to be defending the rights of the Papuans with occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the revolt by arbitrarily arresting and capturing thousands of people in Paniai in the name of “national sovereignty.”
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as “a sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is only a little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is also too expensive for the locals,
Just like the bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five fields of sweet potato.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have widened, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to locals for better-skilled and wealthier migrants.
Only a few Papuans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is overlooked around the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare filming warrant. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or contributed to the development by removing the restrictions on news coverage.
“Reporters reporting on the restless eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua, have new risks: denial of a visa and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “numerous and widespread violations,” including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation, chaired by human rights envier Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, said an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There will be a presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
“Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, the president of the tribal council.
He wants Okow to know the situation of the Paniaists: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Paniaists, like the other Papanists, consider the votes they have given to Jokow as a “debt” that must be repaid.
“They don’t want money. They just want justice,” he said.
Despite the threat and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once more showed metaphorical resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the army office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
“My family members were killed,” Yacobus said in a head.
“What else can we do?”
Dereck Chisora calls Robert Helenius' rematch cancel: 'Even your own fans don't want to see'
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora blasts the reason for the rematch to be completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's terrible.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial scoring.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation is no longer annoying for Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to have surgery," Chisora said.
The British say they are currently in about 45 percent shape.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but aims for Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
Fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames took over one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
This was the second fire in a building that happened to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured. There was no idea of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
“We were asleep and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about 10 minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue authorities, the firefighting forces were able to extinguish the fire at four in the morning local time and remain to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may reassuring questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the board of the Torch building commissioned a study to find that the most damage was the boards used for the cladding and insulation of the facade.
In the UK, police believe the isolation and cladding boards of London's Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 21 o'clock on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later Thursday.
The police will request observations on the moped or its collection by email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take banned items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of travelers in the U.S. had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items to aircraft past U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of the passengers had knives or other bladed objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was conducted by the Stratos Jet Charters charter airline. The results also reveal that young travelers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated the rules of the TSA, 19.7 per cent were representatives of Generation Y and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X generation.
The most common rules were violated by taking food and liquids on board.
More than three per cent admitted to deliberately taking bladed objects to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they deliberately exported banned drugs to the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken the smuggling goods past the security checkpoint and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most frequent travelers also take smuggling goods most likely past the security checkpoint – consciously or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey states, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed to be taken to the aircraft and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For a while, it was also thought that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids may be exported for domestic flights but not for international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Director Scott Pruitt swirled his decision to delay decisions made under Obama to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt revoked his earlier decision to delay the execution of decisions made during Obama's administration that would reduce emissions from smog.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads will take better account of the needs of the decision-makers in the states responsible for environmental issues than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a word of the action that had been brought against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start to comply with the 2015 ground level of the ozone standard from 1 October.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year so that his agency would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan because the agency “does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth.”
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before he was appointed head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to relax the regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA chief exceeded his authority in attempting to delay the execution of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies. The decision obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his complete translation of the ozone regulations only reinforces EPA's cooperation with the Lands in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
“During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to challenge it to a court to reach an agreement on schedules,” Pruitt said. In his previous position, he sued the Environmental Agency more than a dozen times.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation concerning our activities seriously and the powers conferred on us by it.”
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt can continue to use its ‘powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers’ to ensure that the provisions ‘are justified and based on the best information available’.
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the bill passed last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on by the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York State Attorney General who led the U.P.A.'s state consortium, who sued the EPA this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ozone on the ground is created when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people. It is also part of the reason for the thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced in Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We will have to fight the Trump administration, for its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups.”
Supercar manufacturer to become SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer introduces its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savo of the same type of virus
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, says THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has ensured that the measles infection confirmed by a person in Rantasalmi on Friday 28 July is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the area in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth person, new infections may still come up until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, Soster's physician in charge of infectious diseases in primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions have been reported since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.

Finland is preparing for a permissible scream
The soup of the moonshine was not even considered for legalization.
In the background, the reason that the process produces, along with the liquor, methanol, which is toxic.
It will be legal to prepare the squeal at home next year, but the legalization of moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, the moonshine is distilled.
The regulation of the dissent is based on the grounds that the process produces, in addition to liquor, methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to enact the soup of the moonshine as everyman's right, comments Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the moonshine was not considered for legalisation.
This was not brought to the political table either.
There was no discussion about the release of the distillation, says MP Outi Mäkelä (National Coalition Party).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
The permit to distill at the moonshine's home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for the home production of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be brewed at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally scream at home.
The government wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of the scream, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring materials created during their fermentation are clearly noticeable in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared for yourself as much as you want, and you can give homemade alcohol as a gift.
It should still not be put up for sale.
The act of Scream is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will be processed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been discharged from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he was discharged from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said that the former top athlete is in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcribed phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcriptions of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to end his public speech that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called for Nieto to have publicly knocked out the wall project. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a transcript of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, there was a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. would take refugees on their way to Australia must be “ridiculous,” “miserable” and “stupid.” According to Trump, the deal negotiated under Obama would make him look like a “idiot” because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day.”
Georgia massacre: Activists reframe racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small bridge of Moore’s Ford.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
“Roger, n---u!” the man squawks.
“Out of the car!”
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-staging, which was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded around the neck of the “Roger”.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to the Moore’s Ford Bridge to reframe the events of 1946. At the time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with the murders.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in the years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to re-set them.
“It’s a shame stain on history, but above all it’s a burden that weighs on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-staging is a startling call to action. It also reminds Monroe's residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the culprits to go to trial. We want things to finally be completed, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice,” Brooks said.
“We cannot recover and make peace until we have justice.”
The coroner covers the body of the victim of the Georgian massacre on 27.7.1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching in Monroe and the surrounding counties.
No one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, Georgian state blacks were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the election was held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident during the election in which a black tenant, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumoured that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child for him.
According to FBI information, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid for Malcom's 600-dollar bail on 25 July 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore’s Ford bridge.
“It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders,” the FBI said.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
“It was a suffrage murder,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-staging of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the performance, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides,” the director says.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or you don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
This year's rehearsal began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always so difficult and disgusting.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh said.
“However, it is important that this aspect of history is also kept on display so that it will never happen again.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, aka Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester. He's furious that Hester's had a relationship with Dorothy.
“Didn’t you hear? I said get out of my mind, n---u!”
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then the punch goes.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the hardest.
“What?!” Rascona asks.
He's confused.
“Did I accidentally hit too hard?” he asks.
“No,” Greene said.
“I just don’t think the Whites used the word n---u at the time.”
“Yes,” the other black actor confirms.
“It’s slang. You have to use a longer version.”
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is occupied by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the sake of the show. They want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene starts over.
Now Rascona's words are slashing.
No one's laughing.
The re-staging stops quickly and violently.
Screaming, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral outfit stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken for every other word.
A few dozen spectators a few dozen meters away wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca in New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks to the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have come true from the story. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children squat down to look at the artificial blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” the little boy murmurs as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers take off their robes and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man from the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
‘Don’t worry,’ said the woman in the show.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
It's hard for Denise Duplinski to find the words when she describes the feelings that the show has evoked.
“It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible actions that people say and do, who look like you – precisely because they look like you,” he says.
“The show made me notice that lynchings are still happening,” he added. “They’re just called arrests.”
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He said he had already started planning next year's presentation.
“Restalling is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we’ve been through, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks said.
“Its message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
The ripping of vegetables in stores is turbulent: This is how much it actually saves by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking a big part of the pineapple out of the pineapple - it weighs a lot?
The answers strongly divide opinions: for one, it is an indication of extreme sluggishness, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and, however, go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in the shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people rip the leaf parts of cauliflower out, for example.
From the box, the newspapers are taken to the store's biowaste.
According to a news release published by Taloussanomat, sniffing at the vegetable counter surprises merchants.
But how much does it save money to remove the extra parts of vegetables before weighing?
What is the important means of sluggishness really?
We Women tested how the price changes when taking the leaves or stems off the pineapple, top artichoke, champignoses, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of the cauliflower costing 2,10 euros was 1,80 euros, when you peel all the leaves out of it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when its stock was twisted away.
Top artichoke: 2.60 euros was 2.40 euros when the short-term stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without strains, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain of 80 cents.
The result: If you start to pick the leaves and stumps off, you save a few dozen centimeters at best for one vegetable.
Considered as a percentage, the price of the vegetable fell by up to 20 per cent.
So I would have saved a total of 1,20 euros for these purchases!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - the brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP reported.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a Spanish league player, a 222 million euro buy-out price.
The transfer fee of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Earlier, the record was set by Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempt by Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, a buying club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his own contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a potential new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA examines details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (UEFA) so that the union could determine the possible disciplinary measures to the incident.
Spanish league leader Javier Tebas has suspected that PSG's spending is in breach of UEFA's financial fair play rules.
UEFA can punish the club, which will make a loss of more than 30 million euros in three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic clauses.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell multiple players for significant sums, Uefa said.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Tenstans for Neymar
Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - the flash was caught on the airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing the usual work on a plane at the International Airport of Lunch Florida with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The power of the lightning threw the plane to the ground of Dunn, near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had a third degree of burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that his brother was electrocuted and he was in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive," Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone," Autumn says.
According to an airport spokesperson, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson will cut 3 000 jobs and revive the business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it started a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company already cut 4 000 jobs in connection with the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive the business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his stake in Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company said it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its net sales grew by one per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber hit a military act in the Afghan capital of Kabul. Authorities said a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to a statement from NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a statement from NATO, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "person-carried self-explosion device."
The statement said the condition of all the injured was stable and was being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, where Shiite Muslims live.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's deadliest militant group since U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the U.S. is sending more troops to help the local army and police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, the policies it pursues, and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA swirls its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke spray regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) swirled its decision to delay the execution of decisions made during Obama's reign that would reduce smog-reducing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called ‘ozone definitions’ in 2015 late on Wednesday. According to the agency, the decision demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and we want to meet the needs of the states,” Scott Pruitt, the head of the government, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone specifications by one year until October 2018. According to the specifications, smoke fog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced according to stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mainly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia. They said it was illegal to postpone the implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to relax Barack Obama's environmental regulations. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing in the air containing ozone “can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspects said the bomb was to be taken on a plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
Police would not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that secretes toxic colourless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, for example on public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorists' plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Saturday in police raids.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation will also continue.
Neste's CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to a record level, and the development of the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favorable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the 66.7-kilo series, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports station's office in Los Angeles, until the WBC's unbeatable lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia defeated former four-class world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five in the list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and asked, “How are you, Master?
Good luck with the match!”
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the duo posed for the photographers, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between the men would be “perfect in terms of size.”
“I’m a former featherweight,” Garcia said.
“I moved up the series [63,5 pounds] for the Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 kilos.
I want to get back to the lightweight.
He has to climb to the lightweight [61.2 pounds]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
The holidays agreed.
“Boxing needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will make his debut in the lightweight series later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will compete in the lightweight category at the Forum on September 23.
“The match could be on a pay channel because fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later announcing that he was ready to fight on the channel, which offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else is attracting the same attention.
It’s okay with me as soon as we reach an agreement...”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an “incredible fighter” and was planning to go see Saturday’s fight.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia’s sluggish praise and said that this three-weight master from Riverside looked “really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said he focused first on showing the impact force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was wanted to be more and more intense.
“This is the match we’re waiting for.
No other match attracts so much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. “Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match."
Average salary 5 300 euros, education what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talked about a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat reported on Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full-blown when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightenings are based on the new MiFD, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the competence requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment services complete their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The Financial Sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investment Degrees Ltd., whose degree working group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), universities and actors in the field.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material of the degrees includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Degrees Ltd, says that the pass rate for exams is roughly about 70.
Of the largest banks, almost all of the service providers have completed either the APV1 or APV2 degree, because they are mandatory under the companies' own rules.
Then there are the smaller bankers' shops without mentioning the names, whose staff seems to have avoided completing the degrees, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" such bankers.
According to Savikko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13 000 to 14 000 people and the more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors by approximately 3 000 persons.
Some bankers consider graduation to be an advantage.
More other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Sector Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because then the competence related to the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance-based bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners during regular working hours is approximately 5 300 euros.
On average, men working in the positions earn more than 5 900 euros per month and women over 4 500 euros.
The tenth of those who earn the most earns on average worth about 8 100 euros.
The tenth of the most earning men earns more than 9 000 euros per month or more, one-tenth of the most earning women earn 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice in accordance with the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a company with a licence.
So far, the employee and task level has been trusted in self-regulation.
According to FIN-FSA, the audit carried out by the FIN-FSA involved individual cases where the investment advisor's professional skills and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor's activities.
In principle, you can also work as a seller of investment products, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at an easy level.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free in this regard.
More other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, says Savikko.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new MiFID II.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing the investment services are sufficiently competent.
The FIN-FSA, on the other hand, is likely to be empowered to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, FI's market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the regulation on the requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and investment product vendors.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both the own staff of the investment firms and the tied agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance, FIN-FSA is likely to be empowered to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are, we will decide on this during the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and continuing training.
All this must be documented, and the company has a duty to prove this that this has also been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the job descriptions of the personnel at the individual level.
This will certainly come with different requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, it is also new to work with someone more experienced in the deadline if the competence or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, the change will tighten and make the rules more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner plane "draws" a giant plane on top of the United States
The route was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24's service.
The flight took place on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which departed from Seattle, flew in 18 hours and 1 minute for a distance of 15,700km, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming school pupils are not spoiled by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen persistently snicked with the help of a swimming tube
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra's beach swimming schools will be located in Sludge and Lempukka this and next week.
Even though it rains and then it shines again, young swimmers aren't a big deal, says Taina Itkonen, the head of swimming schools.
This week's swimming schools have a total of 13 children, and next week a dozen.
The number of children this week was affected by the fact that school and preschool are already starting, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is jointly organised by the Liikunta Unification project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach of Liette had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school students were training to stay afloat with the swimming tubs, someone even without.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines Kaikkonen, 5, first doubted how to go deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to swirl towards the shore.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said that he went swimming a lot this summer.
The sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with the swimming pötkylä.
You can be happy with today's achievements, the swimming instructor praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to the water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg's 6, swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for learning swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school students packed up on the pier.
The boys had plenty to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked on fruit and basked in the day.
The teaching in the water continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
It's not part of the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a unifying story"
You see all sorts of things.
A couple of days ago, Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line.
I mean, dish brushes and laundry racks, and a "toilet brush with a border brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film, which will premiere in the autumn.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products are grimaced on social media: When will the Unknown health bandages come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Executive Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are the film's partner.
We support this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support Finnish production and cult film, says Määttä.
According to him, the products will be specially displayed in the stores, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a bit funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not alien to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners of the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichys have been launched, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
The Unknown products were already gutted by Suomen Kuvalehti's blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still a sequel.
The partners of the unknown have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail goods chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of the Swedish asylum seekers' age tests announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been announced. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 % of the tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of asylum seekers more accurately than before. The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the real age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far commissioned 6 880 tests, and the Forensic Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
Of those tested, 80 %, i.e. in 2002, asylum seekers were determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the Forensic Agency determined that the test subject was “possibly 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the asylum seeker was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Department says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
“The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences in the statistics of the previous months,” he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that 442 cases had “indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older.”
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that she was turning 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of the knee joints are taken. Then the dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinsk Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether the person has reached adolescence earlier than usual or later.
“I’ve had a reason to think about it, and I don’t think the method used is the right way.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age, we shouldn’t pretend we can do it,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Agency for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject will soon turn 18. The risk is about 10%.”
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
The five over par result in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen 30 notches down the leaderboard in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday from shared number 11, but was found to share place 41 at the end of the round.
Ilonen got one double bog with three bogs in difficult weather.
Others were difficult too.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot on one under par lap, although he said that there was plenty of work to do in the umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I was hanging with it and in the end the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top spot with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia governor changes party
West Virginia's Democratic Governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night that he was changing the party at a Trump campaign event.
“The Democrats simply abandoned me,” Justice said.
“Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... Today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats.”
The crowd burst into loud applause.
“Tomorrow, a member of a registered Republican Party,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d like to tell you it’s time for a new game.”
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that “the party change of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather build barriers than a better America.”
Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that brings people together,” RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Lightning sows damage - Thursday is even becoming the biggest thunderstorm day of the summer
At the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also be added to southern Finland.
During the past week, thunderstorms have occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in Southwest Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the hardest thunderstorm day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
In Pöytyä, lightning struck the electricity center of a terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of the fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in the sauna at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department deflected the roof and wall to find the fire outbreaks and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, lightning, on the other hand, ignited the outbuilding on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already in full fire phase, and the rescue department had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
The outbuilding, which is about fifty square meters, burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaring lightning strike.
The rescue department came to the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the fault was received between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which the trains in that distance were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5pm.
Since then, train traffic has continued normally also on the track section run by thunderstorms.
Lightning has wreaked havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, there has been relatively little lightning this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely dead-end! says Jari Tuovinen, meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, it also feels powerful for many.
This might seem like a really hard thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the ground lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had the potential even for the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer: by about 16 o'clock, there were 1,790 earth lightnings in the placard.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking year of thunderstorms was experienced in 2015, when the year's lightning count was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning count had risen to 18,386.
So there is still something to be arrested so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a habitat-like environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to be shifted to the south from the northern parts of the country on Saturday, where about 2 000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more uniform rain front in the central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, such thunderstorms only rarely.
Coe praises Russia’s “open-minded” apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world's athletics boss, praised the apology Russia made on Thursday for the doping scandal. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to lift Russia's ban on participation.
On the eve of the World Championships, Dmitry Shljahtin, the Russian Athletics Director, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he intends to fight doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for “all the athletes who were deprived of the gold or silver medal in the competitions.”
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-subsidized doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open-minded proposal,” Coe, the president of the IAAF, told reporters.
“The whole council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities.”
Coe said he was also “satisfied” with Russia’s acceptance of the terms of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group’s recommendation that now is not the right time to end Russia’s ban,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete with the status of a neutral athlete in the World Championships in Athletics in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF's working group, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
“Testing is still inadequate, and the coaches who have been banned from operating are still working freely,” he told reporters on Friday to the IAAF Council following a proposal in London.
The production company was disappointed with the poor success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become as success as the authors had hoped, says Yle.
If you say it honestly, I'm disappointed," admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 viewers, which is little compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
This didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams from foreign spreads, says Sucksdorff.

How do the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France. This is the most expensive transfer of all time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European Football Regulator UEFA, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules of fair play. According to them, PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros for the termination of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary for the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic considerations.
PSG have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer amount and joins him in the star cast, as the club is funded by a family of rulers who have become rich with Qatari oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules of Fair Play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, a Frenchman elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini was of the opinion that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game's financial rules shifted from club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of the Fair Game Financial Rules will last until 2018. During this period, clubs may make a loss of up to 30 million euros.
Although Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA chairman in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
“The fair game rules are still in use, and we will apply them in the future as well,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of their contract with a lump sum, it may appoint the amount in the accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual fee of 44.4 million euros for the next five years.
Based on the fair game's financial rules, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros, which was later reduced to 20 million euros. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014–15 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies that are associated with club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal level of the market, UEFA does not count the aid as the actual income.
This is what happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatari Tourism Authority for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings could be financed by payments from the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee for 2022.
However, the PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Championships. It would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is following attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely than usual.
Sources informed the situation on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the situation with PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015–2016 were 542.4 million euros and operating profit exceeded 10 million euros.
Last period's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar agreement.
Clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, the Spanish league tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move. It was alleged to violate the financial rules of fair play.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state,” Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS. On the state, he referred to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state's funding for the football club's activities. Arsenal is owned by an American sports tribe.
“The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the way football operates in the last 15 years,” Wenger said Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It becomes very difficult to follow the fair game's financial rules. There are so many interests that are related to the fact that the famous player represents the state.”
Now I'm in a hurry: Finland's World Championships athletes' coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should coach at the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualifier.
However, the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British Embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but even that hasn't been good enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
The World Championship medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and will last just over a week from Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are able to take a passion for year after year, whether they have success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prestigious competition to another, where gaining experience is used to mature the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Championship medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, and no veterans, though.
The World Championships medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to watch the races, even though the London medals are not decided until late in the evening due to the time difference.
At the 2015 World Championships in Athletics Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The daredevils expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the results of the rest of the time tell the others and Pitkämäki to qualify for last summer's competition.
No matter what happens in these competitions, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Getting to the finals or setting your own record is a good enough performance for the other Finnish athletes in the competition.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be given a great success in the international youth competitions this summer as well.
Breeding young people's talents and financially supporting their work is more important than maintaining a small group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the Usain Bolt and Mo Farah Games, and not, for example, because of the deterrent of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is the best big air in the Rukajärvi World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race with his last jump, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and I'm feeling good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite.
I'm going to try it again from now on, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express vessel stalled in Helsinki
Viking's new fast vessel FSTR is very late.
The express vessel was supposed to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 18.
There were eight on board loading.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on the boat.
Now the queue of cars is moving a bit, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to get on board in the Port of Helsinki, told at 19.30.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for the ship in their cars.
Viking's Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship departs from Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave from Tallinn to Helsinki at 20.15.

Small Circle Nostele: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story longs for both the glory of the characters in the 80's and the grunge of the 90's (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great sketch show for MTV) and his own time – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscence that we have stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already seems to have lived on.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (among other things, it said H. The backstory of a vegetable can speaking in Jon Benjamin's voice).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the lustful teenagers approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, 90's stalker movies, such as the horror film Hand That Cradles.
At one point, one of the characters digs up the Apple Powerbook, inline skates and “other stuff from 1991.”
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot features Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best things are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see the young Paul Rudd, who has a beard tassel under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the movie Singles. Andy, the king of the camp, who played by Rudd, is getting old.
Moments of random madness may take flight of this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its apparent conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the Wrestling Imagery of the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980's, in which a bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The starring Gregor and idealistic Iosefi stars Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching chess on TV in the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. It's a fun game to spot them.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught imitating the awkward socialist drama – including the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That's why the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In short, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby devouring burgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a consumer and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as numbness.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will rise to the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru is facing a hard bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt of jujitsu and a world championship.
For once, I'm fighting myself with a parent.
It's a funny thing, says 32-year-old Tauru.
Kouvolalainen was supposed to climb the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were quickly brought to the autonomous region of China in Macau.
Tauru has never encountered anything like that before.
This was the first time my game was canceled.
It was annoying, because the preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date for the fight was reached.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
Fitness can get worse if you train too much.
In his previous few struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in standing up.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvolainen describes the typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he's going to get on hard in the first round and try to take him to the carpet.
He's won the world jujitsu championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match did not go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory was left in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when he didn't get a single hit.
When I went to pour, he hit my eyebrow.
It was a shame for a really long time.
A new motivation
Some MMA fights once a year, some climb the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we have another fight this year.
Sometimes the pace got heavy.
I have been training in the last few years and been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing things back.
We got some really good training when we had a friend from Sweden with us.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola resident has to prepare for the physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice the vertical match.
Gagging upright is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
We have to hit sensibly.
If I have the chance, I'll take it to the property myself.
Downstreams are not allowed for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who has fought in China before.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think it's going to be a big, great night.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been impetuous and the easing of inflation has stopped speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow. The bank shifted interest rate hikes because the income level of families is under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee decided by a vote of 6–2 to keep the interest rates at 0.25 per cent. The increase in the rate hike received less and less support this month because economic growth has been impotent.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that there is increasing pressure on household income levels, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rate hikes will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation accelerated by Brexit. In addition, the Bank indicated that the borrowing costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive financial package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will discontinue the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide the programme with a low-cost financing of 15 million pounds, or a total of 115 million.
The minutes of the Bank’s interest rate decision state: “According to the forecast of the Committee responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, when the fall in households’ real incomes will reduce consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for ‘some degree of tightening of monetary policy’ in order to curb inflation.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases were ‘staggered’ and ‘limited’.
In May, the Bank forecasted growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and growth of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 percent and was 1.31 dollars. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was 1.11 euros.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker than expected growth figures dampened the increased expectations of interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but will pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation rate gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases. According to the bank, the situation will worsen before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy ‘can’t prevent’ a decrease in revenue in the coming years. However, it expects that wage developments will recover ‘significantly’ at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound. It will override some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25 per cent after the shocked result of the EU referendum, which plunged the pound into a decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank's latest decision, interest rate hikes had become increasingly louder as inflation tightened the pressure on households. Three decision-makers demanded a 0.5 per cent increase in interest rates in July.
Last month, inflation eased to 2.6 percent in June from 2.9 per cent. However, according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will intensify again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the overrun of its two per cent target was “whole” due to the weak pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying as lenders feverishly seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, president of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also cost-free options.”
NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients may be prescribed a ‘reverse’ HIV anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court brought to an end to the dispute over the financing of the drug under the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) therapy is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. Before intercourse, the drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86 % in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year. According to it, the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP drug, although it claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the English NHS, called Thursday’s decision a “significant new intervention,” and the national AIDS organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive registrations for the experiment, which will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prior-intercourse medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A drug taken before intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of the treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates for the trial to meet the criteria for men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partners are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and who have registered for the treatment of a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the English NHS signed a procurement agreement for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
“This important new intervention should complement and enhance the existing, and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
“That yet another significant achievement in the battle of more than 30 years in solving one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS.
“If PrEP medication is targeted correctly at those who need it and those at risk, it could have a revolutionary effect on England’s HIV epidemic.
From September, those at risk will receive a medicine through a trial funded by the NHS, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to consult with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk is left out of it,” said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people in high-risk groups from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was prolonged in vain by several months due to the government’s slowdown,” said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government’s health minister.
“We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country. In this way, we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been stopped.”
Quality of life: the mid-layer and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl’s Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was enthusiastic about property renovation, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house. The success of the renovation is illustrated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her gear and moved.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment,” Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where you could only get into the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to make use of the room height.
“I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
That was my demand,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space in the rooms, which were almost four metres high, and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale, but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
“Steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to cry.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right both on and under them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms with fascinating details in the space.
On the interlayer, the Retrouvius copper truss window opens into the elegant living area.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem to be longer than real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view of the other room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use adds to the elegance.
Kitchens with folding door are not a new solution,
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a little planning,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced mDF door.
“It is balanced, that is, it slides very easily when lifted in place.”
With the sensible use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
“When selling an apartment, the area is crucial – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
“In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.”
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
“No one is attached to the electrical wires in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good planning and additional square meters can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit was right.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before giving birth.
For the A Sustainable Tomorrow dinner, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event smiling.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow in a stunning blue figure-hugging outfit that was wearing a stunningly last-minute pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event where Sofia represents before giving birth.
His due date is in September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was actually beaming in her fresh summer look.
At the event, Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," Sofia said, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared at the Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
At the stall, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He didn't know much Finnish, and the Finns didn't know Thai at the time.
Since the people didn't dare to go to dinner, Panja offered a free tasting.
This is how he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the taste, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the stranger.
When you are hungry and have limited seats, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with the dictionary, learning the Thai language.
Two years went by the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because they said that homemade spice pastes smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we gossipers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we have to ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows her clients.
He's told what's been going on and who he's been seeing.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers what a man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
He has also opened our sense of taste to our thoughts and our hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about Thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I Admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's hardworking.
He's working on a restaurant in a mushroom and a blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the two-decade anniversary.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any noise or attention, this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a significant list of work against terrorism.
The list contains the data of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data, but also pictures of each of them.
Of the people mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the place of discovery on the list and the information contained in it has become more detailed.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found a list of the terrorists' personal data and images while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying reason was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and pictures of all persons, the list also includes their date of birth, invented alias and information about the person's home country.
The list also includes the specialities of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J., who is on the list, reads the name of the battle with Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later through Turkey to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber is written next to his image.
There is no further information on the man's fate.
A total of 6 000 fighters have left Europe for ISIS, the fate of which is uncertain.
A man fell under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on the rescue department's interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
According to the Helsinki Rescue Department's on-call fire chief Ville Estlander, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the report.
The rescue department's diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a report after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was taken into the hands of emergency care.
Estlander said it was a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander praises the cooperation between the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
The participants also guided the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, according to the on-call fire chief.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident happened at a crossroads of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The crash occurred when a second car turned from behind a warning triangle in front of another car, according to the on-call fire chief.
According to the rescue department, the intersection area has an 80-kilometre per-hour speed limit.
The brothers are fighting for real estate assets of more than 500 million dollars
Two brothers are arguing about one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than 500 million dollars. The dispute relates to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Torak value area just three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought a dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for US$85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Under the agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as “the driving force and central figure of the family.”
According to court documents, the distribution ratio of the property means that Colin owns about 316 million dollars worth of real estate and Paul about 176 million dollars.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was first heard on Friday in the Supreme Court after several attempts to mediate.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of the business.
Colin said the claim was not true. He blames Paul for the poor care of some properties.
Colin writes, together with his first sworn testimony, that he would like to reach a solution.
“According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important to me,” Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970's they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral to buy a property in Collingwood where Colin started the family's first denim store.
Colin said he founded the store in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in an amicable manner.
“Luigi often said he didn’t want the brothers to end up in court,” Anna wrote in a statement.
The family's other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received US$10 million and Luke 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “bitter of the financial conditions of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League's board and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered. He said in a text message that he could not really comment on the matter because it will be heard in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family’s name into a legal battle,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
“Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, saying he still hopes to reach a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone out.
“Our case will be decided in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's finally gonna be okay.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and follow-up so that the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reported:
“When the White House’s new Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with executives on her first day of work, she raised a key issue that she intends to solve: she plans to limit access to information for President Donald Trump.
Kelly told White House employees that all information – both printed and heard at the briefings – must pass through her because the president makes better decisions when he receives good information.”
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship of decades with television – and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
“If Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media were dealing with things more equitably,” Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Trump’s campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “six former campaign workers say it’s essential for Trump’s Twitter use to be managed that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise.”
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter would ever have been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even more wild without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left out.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing the problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing the controversy.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing factions in the White House who are trying to pursue their cause by giving Trump information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told about a case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be immensely outraged by newspaper clippings criticizing him – especially if they tell about harmful leaks. Then he has to know where the information came from.
That's what happened at the end of February, when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the online provocateur Charles C. A news release from GotNews.com, founded by Johnson, accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later revoked them. He also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started reading the article to ask the staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-HR Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter “had tried to introduce a system for the management of documents going to Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more powerful leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still pursuing their own affairs.
These immutable facts make Kelly's mission extremely difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP reported.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a Spanish league player, a 222 million euro buy-out price.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The transfer fee of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Earlier, the record was set by Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Best-selling author Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the order of my life"
Of the TV series, the best-selling author Raija Oranen, known for her time and the Clean White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
The hypnosis helped Raija Oras.
Five grandchildren consider the grandma so in their grip, along with writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The appearance is 20 kilograms lighter.
The weight started to drop when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were antidepressants.
I got help for alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the radiant author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same distance for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been together for more than 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, she's stopped living that," Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had a large career as a writer, only remembers the good 44-part Pure White Sheets TV series that touched and moved the recession-era Finland.
I finally decided to become an industry of the Fresh Family company in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes work as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He thought the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many manuscripts in the works - ideas hundreds.
The cyclists returned over the ditch to the “millionaires’ alley”
The wealthiest homeowners of Western Midlands are again hair-seitted with stubborn orbiters who managed to cross the municipality's longed-for-all trench and return to the field next to the houses.
The cyclists parked their twenty caravans near a street called a millionaire's alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but managed to cross the moat needed by the municipality as a barrier. They brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The cyclists managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
The infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of “the complete inability to solve the problem”.
The resident, who remains anonymous, says the tourists came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
“The municipality must be toughened up to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The cyclists were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today.”
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to the other resident, who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the orbiters returned so soon after they were driven out.
“There are more of them than before, and they have even laid a horse in the park that the horse is grazing.”
According to a spokesman for the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to form an overall picture of the situation for the purpose of court proceedings.”
Infurious people surrounded Portugal's crash plane
The men who crash-landed on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the crash.
Two men who flew the plane could be charged with involuntary manslaughter.
At its longest, it could be sentenced to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
The small plane flown by the men had to crash-land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical fault.
At the time of the incident, hundreds of people were on the beach, some of whom ran away from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who was back to the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began to beat it, said Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, in the newspaper Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star, who tragically lost his leg, won the World Championship gold medal again: "Without the accident, I would not be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the Finnish World Championships in the banked slalom in the competition held in Big White, Canada, early on Wednesday morning.
Suur-Hamari also won the cross World Championships earlier in the competition.
There have already been three World Championship titles.
What an incredible World Cup!
The gold was taken care of twice, with a pretty good heart rate, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is constantly increasing.
The whole paralum boarding has been growing and developing a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new skiers involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eagerly counting with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take him to the slope.
It reminds me from time to time what my life would be like without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's pointless to ifs.
Those cards are used to play what is divided, Suur-Hamari emphasises.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Greater Hamari does not.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without the accident.
Before the accident, the biggest snowboarding enthusiasm of 23-year-old Greater Hamar was already fading.
My job towards the top started in earnest only after the accident.
I was training with my friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there in the X-Games start.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought that this would be a really long life if I stay here to get bitter and feel sorry for myself.
I decided to pull on my overalls and start working.
I would say that I have done quite well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair reeler Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion won his prize at the sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal for the parasports.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the world of parasport.
When is the time to launch the two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's athlete of the year campaign?
We'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Greater Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he has coveted.
Next year is a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympics will take place in South Korea.
We'll go there and get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Between February and March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the respondents may think of returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of the young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the permanent homecoming, while a quarter thinks the most important thing would be the departure of ISIS from the country.
Just under a tenth of the most important factors influencing the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrians were asked which factor is the most important factor for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority is of the opinion that the end of war is more essential than the abdication of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter consider the presidency of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
You only believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS power weakened in the past year, while a fifth feel that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media would convey to people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised the primary means of military measures and the reform of education.
More than a tenth thinks that the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the conflict in Syria will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are split in two on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the internet organized - the database he developed is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example
The Espoo-based company MariaDB develops the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of the MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing, and it can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept organized and quickly available.
If you use, for example, Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the Chief Technology Officer of MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man working remotely from Kauniainen contributes to ensuring that the Internet operates smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with the Swedish company David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun acquired MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured the Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't give a certain promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired twenty of the best developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB Code.
"During MySQL, these confirmations were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50 per cent per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
The growth-focused MariaDB does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is scantly worded about the company's key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders worth 20 million euros.
Because the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically spreading to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, gamblers like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing, sints.
In the database market of about 50 billion dollars, open source databases do not reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured in money alone, because the majority of users do not pay anything for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced or the transition would have been started at least.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them choose open source.
This has led to the fact that the license fees of commercial databases have jumped to the cloud.
The companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Because it is difficult to change a closed database, the majority of customer companies have obediently swallowed up price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult, because their old applications and others are attached to a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming.
When license fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later go to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent from the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of 25 million euros from the European Investment Bank (EBIA).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB's funding was the impact of the MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed at how Finland spends money on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that you can't think of or can't do yourself.
In addition to the other Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, the 55-year-old Widenius is one of the best-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of the open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy is increasing its attitude towards NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean, that they may not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not commit to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
The warning from Minnit came a day after the Italian authorities seized a ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet. Its crew is suspected of having cooperated with the smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has been operating for just a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organisation said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of having taken boatloads of refugees directly from people smugglers who re-used the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the coast of Libya. The information is provided in the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defiance of the Italian coast guard, which is monitoring rescue operations in the area. The motive is the enthusiasm for help.
According to the Code of Conduct, vessels such as Iuventa must be accompanied by the Italian police, which supervises the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, as they do not cause ‘significant changes or obstacles’ to the organisation’s rescue operations.
Among those who refused to follow the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees as a sign that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors will begin to produce results.
“In recent days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that plans to continue this month's discussions with the mayors of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing her husband in Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Kuttanen, Enontekiö, last December.
Police said a 36-year-old man from the Czech was suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect had fled into the terrain with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when caught.
The charge must be filed in less than a week.
The case may be discussed in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My Friends of All Hairs, has died

The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter. Her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
“My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at Thursday’s session.
“My son was my best friend.”
Carter appealed the verdict and had to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored sweater, Carter listened with his judgment on his hands crossed with a weeping look on the ground.
“What he did killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“He ended Conrad’s life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act,” the prosecutor continued.
“He has shown no remorse.”
Carter’s lawyer said the incident was “caused by “shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz was of the opinion that Carter’s “age or maturity, and even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read the statement of Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy, in which the mother told me that “it doesn’t take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can handle all of this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad’s sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was “stalked” by the idea that she will never see her brother’s wedding and be an aunt to her children.
“It’s painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never go away,” Camdyn said.
The case appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted nationwide attention when it emerged that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
“Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don’t know, there are many habits,” Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy’s suicide, Carter wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “You just have to launch the generator, and you’re free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death. The judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Very few people have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering a British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece by Knox, saying, “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: Relationships with Russia the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not tighten to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had even fallen dangerously to a poor level.
Trump called for a thank you to the countries' bad relations with Congress, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to the 850 000 diesel engine due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350 000 cars.
The head of BMW said the company believed that “there are more sensible options than driving restrictions.” He referred to European cities, including the hometown of BMW, Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the CO2 emission targets.
Emissions of nitrogen oxide from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralizes emissions will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under strict attention, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of sympathizing with large car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating equipment in the cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in the tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent Europe's emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar study in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Venezuela's vote began a fraud investigation, with large demonstrations to be held
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures that the crisis will end
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a council was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organized a change against the demonstrations.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be underway at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Pais newspaper, the country's national security forces began taking control of the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the southern French province of Provence, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Laventeli is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. With them, the rainfall in spring, and especially autumn, has clearly decreased,” says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
“This shortens the life of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area, which spread microbacteria.”
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of long cobs and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened, or completely absent,” says Chaisse.
“In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil.”
The solution is sought by enhancing watering, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, more drought-resistant varieties will be developed.
Journalist's murder manifests growing threat in Mexico
The once-a-week Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them to the delivery, which was the subject of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking the reporters for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and sensations are sufficient.
The board is written with the names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels. They are criminals who make the Mexican chaos news life-threatening.
Violence is incessant, and increasingly the target of the attacks is journalists. According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. Under the federal protection, there are 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened. This year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads, “Justice.” Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, a journalist in their 30s, are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a patched panama hat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears that have become paranoid.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's post was established specifically for the handling of cases of journalists, but according to the Supervision Committee of Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely tried, as do thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime each year.
Riodoce's journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
“To be honest, this meeting is a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know why.”
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan on the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with his wife and two adult children.
The rumors move quickly and float freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is mouse-slow.
Sinalo has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing groups want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storey two-storey grave buildings of drug lords, which are larger than the homes of many.
The coastal state is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a rival grouping that is at war with the sons of Guzman.
The story may have angered the Guzman's sons: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had had a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish a Riodoce with five colleagues. The magazine's shares were sold for 50 dollars at the time.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the magazine began to be felt about its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hardcore investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of its coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to be able to move on with my life,” he said, receiving the Resources Committee for the Protection Committee for Journalists.
The drug deal is a “lifestyle” in Sinaloa,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The journalist must accept a task that falls on him – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was dying here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce's staff needs Valdez – a joker who cursed like a harbor worker. They need a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his downfall.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it if we cover their women and children and their clean businesses in our stories, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the case,” Bojorquez says.
It meant, even in the best case, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
trusting one's own instincts.
If you feel like everything isn't right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce’s reporter Andres Villarreal, is that “the impression can be deceived, and that’s what happened in Javier’s case.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there are dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies, and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce's safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had emerged that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had taken a shelter in the shade of the tree from the 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists half-joked about whether these two police officers belonged to the 50 percent group that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had been in a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's issue, Riodoce's delivery was planning three main things.
The brother of the boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending had focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so it had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The PRI has ruled Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases of much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of “El Chapo” Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would receive reliable information about the kidnapping in Valdez's column.
“We would have known what had happened before,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed ‘El Flaco’ because of his slim physique.
“Now all connections to our sources of information are broken.”
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored. The newspaper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who promote freedom of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning in front of the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration, which was caused by yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the assassination of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder across the country. In the demonstrations, “SOS Press” texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to get international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since asked to be moved away from the government because he is concerned that his anger is not objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were caused by the police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez said.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: “I’m here because of my writings.”
Next to his cut-out head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some will continue to operate, as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on its front page: “What do you want from us?”
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the country.
The decision is difficult.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals searched for a reporter, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was supposed to become a poet at the time – admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, the journalists of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk on the sidewalk on midnight on Friday, when the latest issue of the magazine was completed. Suddenly their phones began to vibrate as a sign of the message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had been killed in a Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel's messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce's website on the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be rebuilt the next day.
Sirens howled nearby – yet another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's editorial board continued the tradition of the founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, in which the man shows the middle finger to the whole of Sinalo.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down. “How can I shut down the newspaper when our intern asked me to get on the street to do the story the same day that Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, was short-lived, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May was practically completely sick.
First there was a cold and finally a pediatric disease like an ear infection, for which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was able to do only ten percent of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the enthusiasm for training, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was not granted a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the roller mat test conducted on 12 June by the Research Centre for Racing and Top-Level Sports KIHU.
In the test, the athlete skis on a carpet with roller skis, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I managed to ride the mat for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
I came across a wall, Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also a week and a half holiday from flying.
I also had time to visit the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race, when Manninen rose to 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the head coach of the national team, Petter Kukkonen, have drawn up a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, we are supposed to be in at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, I plan to be part of Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Manninen.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, says the Nummela resident, who celebrated gold in Salt Lake City in 2002, underlines.
The dinosaur was protected from his enemies by camouflage
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first research results of a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner, which was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been so preserved that the researchers could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a “problematic past.”
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur of all time and some of the world's best representatives of its species.
The fossil discovered recently is a nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110–112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armoured vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found at the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit someone who didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Pacific Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a boulder of 1 100 kilograms.
The results of the hard work are now available.
“If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep,” says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
“It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Naha's studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masks it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter coloring on the top, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was able to better mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it the brand from Borealope, after museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7 000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been so amazingly preserved that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a common coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on the top and lighter on the under.
The sighting was still a surprise, because Borealope is significantly larger than the current animals with the corresponding coloring.
It can be concluded that it was predated by meat-eating dinosaurs to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
Of the current animals, for example, deer, zebras and armadillas have a similar coloring. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that the nodosaur was also seriously threatened.
“The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells you how dangerous the Credito-Age dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions about its life. Among other things, they studied the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell into the river when it died and drifted to the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they do today.
“This nodosaur is really significant because its scaly leather has been preserved and it has also been preserved in its original form in three dimensions,” Brown said.
“That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous
It doesn’t take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little, you can almost believe that it was asleep.”
The Cretate period was an era of theropods, huge bipedal, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified himself into the mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and armour from snout to hip.
On average, the nodosaurs were five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-metre spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe this armored vegetarian passed through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river transported it to the high seas.
Its armor has been preserved in small details in the underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remnants have been preserved so well that its leather is still left in the pitted plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic that such survival is “as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull-tanked plates still have fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also lower the scales of the sole of the foot.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
A day earlier, he arrived in New York from his home in St. From Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from a high school friend:
“The police just killed an 18-year-old young person, and his body is still on the street.”
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That's why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were numerous retweets from @TheePharoah on his timeline.
The username belongs to St. A Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old blackman, Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police shut-offs and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, whose sign read: “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time videotage of police standing in front of the protesters with the barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of another police officer squeezing his rifle and shouting, “I’m going to kill all of you... animals.”
“This isn’t normal,” Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’re used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11pm. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been the subject of a documentary film “Whose Streets?” It premiered in cinemas on 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a floral dress and a crown that was compatible with it, they re-examined a conversation about “what it’s like to live in black and in what conditions.” They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
“Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?” Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t help but take my daughter with me,” Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also be familiar with the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black. And he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even though I've been able to protect her from blatant racism, she's still like the rest of the black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station. It became a camp for activists as they waited for information on the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” he said. While studying at the University of Missouri, St. In Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nurse Students. At the time, he focused on food law and health ingests in black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “just wanted to tell” what was happening.
There was a suspicion in Ferrell's mind. He asked, “Do you really want to tell us what’s happening, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?”
The suspicion was caused by the countless times that people, usually whites, had appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
“We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice,” Folayan said in a recent interview. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, known for his activism among death-sented prisoners.
Davis's presence prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This isn’t a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how the local people are portrayed in the film, because I’m portrayed the same way.”
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience, because it was wanted to show that the popular movement “is not about a charismatic leader but a community.” However, Ferrell proved to be the most open of the photographs.
That's why the documentary features surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as he told me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the humanization of blacks requires a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's story recounts and brings the role of black queer women to the centre again in the larger Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot and killed black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify with the queer identity.
“The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” says Ferrell. “It’s because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeed sustained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women.”
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary “self-purposedly” because of his queer identity.
“He got the energy moving,” Folayan said.
“It’s no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the big screen.”
The film crews have long since left Ferguson, but relations between the community and the police are still strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left. He was convicted of blocking the highway at a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home neighborhood is brief and concise: “A mess.”
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
A suitable resemblance: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has a face hanging in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see a resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits of the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose prison sentence was lifted by Barack Obama on the third last day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical statement on the adaptability of DNA data, ambiguity and the cause-and-effect relationships and identity behind the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 counts of offences, including violation of the Spying Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the prison-convicted Manning: a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which the bothered Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car. He's wearing a platinum-blond wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had the hugely popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He received DNA data on, for example, cigarette butts and chewing gum and created pictures of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of the story,” Dewey-Hagborg told a new show.
You couldn't visit Manning and you couldn't film him in prison. So the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondents. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Suppressed Images comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and he would have access to the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published. It was a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leakers and transgender soldiers, and is coming up with more and more new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divisions he actually had to ease.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the gallery wall is the artist's statement and under it is Manning's great autograph, where the point of the last name i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to “the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based.”
On the opposite wall is the DNA sequence of Manning: a long sequence of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or a nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are genetically equal and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations,” says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his 2007 video work Spurious Memories.
“DNA tells countless stories. There are 30 of them here.”
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's figure rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
“If they can shut you up, they’ve won,” the picture reads.
“Never be silent.”
“The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” says an artist from Philadelphia.
“It’s so impressive that I still get chills.”
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data, like a group of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the DNA sequence of Manning is written with a pencil at a height that is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
“My face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a sense of crowd to them,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea had created, which was also behind his release.”
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being sought on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Cook County Court documents show that arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who are suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death. The arrest warrants have been issued for the murder of the first degree without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
Police officers who were alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with several cuts on his body.
Authorities said Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder. Police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Vice President for Social Affairs at the University Alan K. Cubbage said in a statement sent by email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from access to Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement by a spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said, “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief of information at the Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
“The police have a perception of their whereabouts, and we are constantly clarifying our search,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will help in the search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza team released the following statement to residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the condemned told police.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of making his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore's staff alerted them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threased to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for threats.
The threat was not related to the bookstore's events.
Authorities discovered that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police during interrogation.
As a punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay the legal costs of 620 pounds, i.e. about 690 euros, and compensation of 85 pounds, or about 95 euros, to the victims.
Scotland Yard's spokesman said several hate crimes were not reported.
“We will take the actions in line with the WADA roadmap to the decision in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
“Some of the measures in the roadmap have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission (UKAD).
WADA’s roadmap has been updated in this respect,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which defines the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the roadmap was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
“Everything is announced, and everything is being implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of a Canadian lawyer's investigation by WADA, Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state's alleged involvement in Russian sports doping.
To that, Mutko said: “The study is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we cannot admit what did not exist.”
Mutko's words contained echoes of the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian sports media earlier that day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-dopings. “We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally,” he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olivier Niggli, president of WADA, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he said the organization was on the ‘right path’ towards the restoration of jurisdiction.
British organisation skeptical of the innovation that Finns love: There is "no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packages"
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, say that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting cot deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of cot death.
Cot death means the baby's inexplicable sudden death.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert on the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow to pack our official brochures in them, as it would imply that we would recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that they give each family a box might be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure, said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cot deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products on the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends using the package only for a nap and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
The snarling escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time
The staff of the Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, West Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The 35-year-old rogue is female, 55 kilos and about one meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the area of the nursery.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The crook's last escape happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The responses were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
“The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective,” Errett says. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to seek outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can be used to measure employee engagement. Companies can query and target specific teams and population groups, as well as provide anonymous advertising services to their employees and, in some cases, a direct connection to the board of directors.
“You can follow your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where are the companies’ Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint Startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says that he has gained a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick inquiries and votes to certain teams. In addition, it can be used to create a map showing at a glance which departments the employees are the most dissatisfied with and which managers have received the weakest estimates. Based on these, Errett may have drilled into the root of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don't become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are being harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global industry whose value could reach more than 118.7 billion dollars by 2020, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber's reputation suffered a blow.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of inappropriateness, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
“General opinion has overthrew the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily connect with the headquarters.
Previously, it was the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out the phone number or email address that could be used to report the head office. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” said James Vitrano, General Counsel at Ruby Tuesday. According to him, the complaints made by the employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from executives in another city or state. Now, problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related legal proceedings.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that the companies understood that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their dirty laundry.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by private equity investors. Both Glint and Convercent are backed by private equity investors.
In February, Convercent raised US$10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised a total of 47 million dollars in capital.
In November, Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of US$60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and risk capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces.
Good wages in a competitive market like Silicon Valley, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel they are listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, Executive Vice President, LinkedIn, Rewarding and Welfare.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Businesses succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they interest investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of a change.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a management consultancy, who has seen companies rely too much on simply gathering information.
“If the company does not take action, the employees will start to think about whether they were heard
Does their opinions matter?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday better understands its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term retention of its employees in a industry known for their high turnover.
“If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” says Vitrano.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly photographing his naked female neighbor, according to the TT news agency.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home when she noticed a cell phone hanging from her string outside her window.
According to the woman, the phone's camera was filming in the apartment.
The woman, who was frightened by the incident, had run to the other room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that had been lowered to the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of secret photography has admitted to photographing a woman.
He claimed to have only photographed the woman’s face.
The video, filmed on a cell phone, had been removed and police had not been able to return it as evidence.
During the interrogation, the man has admitted to the crime, but denied committing the crime.
The man had justified his portrayal by saying that he loves his neighbor "absolutely crazy."
According to the news agency TT, the man will be charged in the case.
Teachers demand more money in the autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday pay highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to make agreements in which the holiday pay cuts were not included in the review in some way.
In the municipal sector, agreements are likely to be reached only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages have been announced.
Luukkainen predicts that OAJ's terms of employment, for example, have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luke did not yet reveal.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the public sector training organisation Juko.
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cuts increase earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector wage and salary earners is weakening, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, a temporary holiday pay cut will further sharpen the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, because the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the differences between both pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the Bruins' players was extended as the NCAA reduced daily training from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock tonight. A group of UCLA's American football players have been left talking to the other side of the campus's new training ground.
Some have taken off their jerseys. Their backs shine with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few-minute chat is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, the players studying in the university's summer courses return to the dorm to study for the final exams. The next morning, they gather at the Wasserman Football Center at half-seven.
“The next three days will be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday’s change of ground for Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was intended to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
Therefore, the first three exercises of the UCLA began a quarter of a quarter past seven in the evening. It was already difficult for the players to find space in the full schedules.
Limiting the training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coaching season that continued for the six seasons of Mora, when the training sessions are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The training is scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening game of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the NCAA's rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
“We’re really burdening them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
“But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday. Then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outsiders after the camp. It's not easy, given the direct view from the training grounds to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs that have flown over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to a hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security,” Mora said.
“The worry is that people can book a room and shoot exercises for the video. That's not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises pays a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom to Rwanda
The Central African Rwanda will hold a presidential election on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has been involved in leading the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremist huts.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will run for the third term because the constitution that limited the presidency to two terms was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely liked leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by the genocide.
Rwanda's success has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame, too, has promised his people more freedom after the country has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by stepping up a fact-check
Facebook plans to post any fake news more and more often to independent fact-checkers, as well as present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company released a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to the fact-checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest spreaders of fake news. Many people think that fake news influenced the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
The issue has come up in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that a fact-check would be conducted in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t pass through the screens of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share,” Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook’s newsfeed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test related articles and make other changes to its newsfeed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history. Now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired author who likes old documents.
“I think it’s great to be able to study the text written by someone who died more than 300 years ago,” Rhodes says with longing.
“I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.”
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This isn't Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspirations were documents from the National Library of England. The project was emotional.
“I was in tears when I noticed the thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 17th century,” Rhodes says.
“It was his fingerprints.
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love the archives!”
The author, who was attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle for a little longer than he had hoped.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest keepers, gardeners and sometimes illustrative artists.
In the evenings, he “took whiskey and started writing.”
The nearer history of Scotney is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation's staff was just about to start going through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. “You could imagine that the land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says. “Here, however, families even fought for one birch tree.
I thought I should let it be.”
Some of the stories in the book proceed from castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells the story of a man who joins the English peasant revolt in 1381 shortly after the castle was completed.
“Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes said.
“The peasant rebellion of England began in the same area, and it came to mind that the revolt could begin with a riot.
“Maybe these events are connected?”
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. “The men of the family seem to have been quite a rogue. They were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court the heiress.”
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Life's Hound, a sanatorium that operated in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this damn life.”
You're the worst in Russia since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not tighten to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had even fallen dangerously to a poor level.
Trump called for a thank you to the countries' bad relations with Congress, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko to close - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not take place
Vladimir Klitchko, a long-time heavyweight champion of professional boxing, is ending his career.
Ukrainian Klitchko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought professionally 69 times, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury scored a point in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitchko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitchko were expected to face off in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitchko did not find the motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making the decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Check Klitshko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always emphasized that he wants to quit if he doesn't have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers controlled the titles of the World Championships of different alliances at the same time.
Finland's weather keeper bewitches the conditions: "Take the vibe"
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the outdoor iron season of the summer.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman's vibe away.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Championships in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been against the pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen this summer.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't get even the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here who knows how many times and I've never experienced such a varying wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the training, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was also discussed in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold-jamming or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away the vibe.
There is no point in consuming energy in a bad condition.
He qualified for the World Championships thanks to his hall jump of 455.
It's been 445 outside.
The condition is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross the 460 in Friday's qualifier.
Why not move abroad to train?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology was standardized.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally I've been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal weather to compete?
25 degrees warm.
A small wind is fine, as long as it is constant.
Experienced ex-official slurps politicians on Yle: "We have no room to distribute now or for many years"
Despite the positive atmosphere in the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep the ice in a hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He said there was no room for distribution.
In 2015, Yle interviewed Virtanen, who retired in Wednesday's One Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Virtanen considers the recent politicians' proposals to increase the guarantee pension, lower the car tax and support e-bikes, among other things, as election speeches.
They mainly indicate that the elections are starting to be close, because when ten per cent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about the distribution reserve when taking on debt," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has extensive experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget Department and Budget Manager.
The last time he retired was before retiring, he was Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the now projected economic growth of three per cent is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike from which we will start to go downwards already next year, and Finland expects one per cent growth of tens of years.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit candidates who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our finances,” Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark's spouse does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Pictured is Prince Henry and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, are not buried next to each other, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, couples of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It's no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," court chief Lene Belleby said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural result of not being treated equally with her spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of the wish for her spouse's burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: The car was to come on the highway
Tomm had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party cannot be reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring Road III.
Tommi from Vantaa says that his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his partner Riina and the couple's two young children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in the direction of Hämeenlinna in Vantaa.
From the Ring Road III junction to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to drive to the side of the family's car, Tommi says.
Without the evasive movement, the car would have come on top of Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car crashed into the railing at high speed.
The parents and the two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other less than a year old.
Apparently, it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one passing by drove up to us, even though there was busy traffic.
The accident happened around 17:20.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car was in order for redemption.
Tommi says that he and his partner have a small income, and they received family help to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family will not receive the money from the insurance.
That's why the family hopes for eyewitnesses to find out about the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's difficult to take children to kindergarten and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, oldish car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000's.
In his opinion, the initial registration number of the car was SIG.
If the culprit can't be caught, I don't know how we'll be doing financially, we'll have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who saw or know something about it will be in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had to do a task at the accident site on Tuesday evening.
The title and story were corrected at 21:15: Contrary to what was originally said in the article, the second car did not come from the oncoming lane, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with relationships through humor - The Exhibitionist is seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who is from Kouvola, will bring her debut directorial director to the What? theatre.
The self-exhibitor is a musical theatre performance of relationships and inadequacy that have gone wrong.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is dealt with through humor.
You don’t feel bad, he said.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges you to think about what a person reveals about themselves when getting to know a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling a role or is the other approaching the jacket open?
A plotless presentation confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that even though the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-Exhibitor does not directly tell about his own relationships or the working group's relationships.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my values will be conveyed in the show.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I also don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Exhibitor draws a current picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance will be played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music arrangement is by Jäppinen and Rokka.
The love for the theatre was sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to direct theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Arts Academy.
It's been two years and there's another thing ahead.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The music class breeder has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted in the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
I'm becoming more and more interested in directing.
The self-exhibitor premiered last week on the Narri stage in Helsinki.
The 45-minute performance will also be seen in the future, at least in the study city of Jäppinen, Turku.
The self-exhibitor at Kouvola's What?-theatre 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers from a year of horrific motocross accident - cervical spine fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the mound count toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new sports.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on the ground that the person in Kemijärvi has not tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one of the hobbies was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the crash.
Driving a bike may sound wild.
But I didn't use it to find boundaries.
It's just such a hard sport that it's not worth doing too much forty-somethings like this!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
It was a long time behind the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the position immediately after the end of his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be still.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching, Lahtela often challenged his protégés on the slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts didn't make sense either.
Not even with the sport.
It was good to be still.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd be burned out.
It's easier to find places in the body that have broken off than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as the coach of the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speed sports.
I switched to motocross for disc golf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing for seven hours a day.
Even though Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not require his coaches to be the same as him.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
In our sport culture, there is room to be your own and ways of becoming the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just when it had started to feel like 2017 can't get any weirder.
Yes, yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
“We need to take the rise of sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the foundation and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being giggled, but they’re already selling quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said at the report’s launch.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What's even more worrying is that robots have a ‘personality’ that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as fully as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in a conversational mood or “in that mood.”
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots. They replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resisting, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
“Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn’t men have a sex robot?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their spread and development is a sign of something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual interaction, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although a FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of the time.
And many people don't start acting strange or offensive until the market gives them permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president is sitting in the White House who has boasted about harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid’s Tale (Orjattarsi) is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, for example, images of the hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short distance.
We try to make sex robots as much like real women (with the proportions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
The developers of the robots want their skin to feel real and the movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have neither their own will nor history – nothing that refers to independence or a fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by the ISIS chief
The chief of the extremist group ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspects said the bomb was to be taken on a plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
Police would not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that secretes toxic colourless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, for example on public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorists' plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Saturday in police raids.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation will also continue.
The good of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like a parint of common sense
Under Trump, it has been repeated until the saturation that the strong division of voters has also broken up families on a daily level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper counselling boards were used to show how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'll tell you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week. He is a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been the buttons against our family's Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins – including a Republican-providing sibling, with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it's a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new boost, but the distorting effect of his presidency could actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we’re talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won’t be able to be horrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrible chance that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I look back on Mitt Romney's understated version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and at least we've seen his tax return). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild violations.
When Trump's term is over, the Republicans' next presidential candidate will have to be just lucid, and that immediately feels like a noticeable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It's the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses on the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – the grotesque clowns and the animals looking back in horror – are ominous, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's hallmarks become disappointing over time: the views of the tall buildings are getting boring, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city's reality does not match the dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I haven't been able to get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't a Swiss cottage, but a big roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-inspired pub, but it doesn't count.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their 40s enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the eReader.
The same thing in the café in my hometown, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with a 15 per cent service grant, when I go to get coffee myself from the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service representative to put their personality on the line in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no management confidence"
FC Inter have today relieved Shefki Kuq of his duties as the coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously served as assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching group will continue in its current duties.
Piccareta, an Italian coach, has previously worked as an assistant coach in the English company Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing your coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the club's statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching group, he will be responsible for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the team has been in turmoil throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed strongly in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of youth from the 80's - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the picture, which can be used to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself is seriously surprised by the young woman who is looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he says.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just over a year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In the second picture, she is seen 20 years ago, in the second she is now posing, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like.
After the text, she had added in English the hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating problems in previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing began little by little.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized with incisions on his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he was allowed to fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, saying Pistorius' six-year sentence is too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal may be heard this year.
If the appeal is passed, Pistorius's sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's Foreign Ministry said, according to bTV.
Police arrested a group of people camped without permission in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. There were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already issuing substantial fines to all those camping in areas other than those reserved for this purpose.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court could impose a fine.
Neste's stock sinks - sunk already -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's share has sunk 7.7 percent at 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started today with a slight frost in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the extensive European Stoxx 600 index had declined by 0.2 per cent.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange's general index OMXH had fallen 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points and the most traded companies, OMXH25, had declined by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million was the morning's earnings releaser Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, bloating, frequent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritated bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the head of the study, the immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that harmful microbes that are hiding in food cannot enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to the inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments found that there are immune cells that strengthen tolerance in mice whose guts contain a certain bacteria.
This bacteria needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the gut,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more tryptophan there was in the mice diet, the more immune cells they had.”
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
While studying the immunity-boosting immune cells, Postdoctoral Researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mouses had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of the mice, i.e. the normal bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of the mice was examined, six bacterial species were detected in the mice that had immune cells but not other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that had no gut microbioma and did not develop immune cells in a sterile environment, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – from mice to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri will make the cells develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genotic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surfaces of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
‘A high level of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their increase.’
Jose Mourinho said Manchester United had a ‘nero’ after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a ‘nero’ after signing with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his Manchester United debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for 40 million pounds, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United's final season-previous match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best shape because he was not on the blue shirts' Asian tour before the season started. He only managed on the pitch for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the Premier League season begins.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and mindset make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho says.
“We’ll help him be ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a “great job” by acquiring three of his four players.
“Three out of four – you have to give the club a thank you for that,” he added.
“I’m more satisfied if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.”
Volleyball women plagued Germany for two rounds
Finland's women's national volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup to Germany in a straight set 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level in gaming is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two sets, Finland kept their opponents tight, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to rock along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was Piia Korhonen, who had 14 points.
Finland, who have lost three matches out of four, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Major jury already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr.'s meeting on Russia
In the United States, a major jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for his Kreml-linked connections.
This is reported by Reuters, which also confirms the Wall Street Journal's announcement earlier on Thursday of the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, a major jury has sent challenges related to the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Veselnitskaya, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a major jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russia investigation is intensifying.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help investigate Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his immediate circle cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on a sworn.
A large of the jurors is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether the charges should be brought.
The British inventor microchipped himself to get to his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor has been the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get to his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of the 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthetician at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the installation of a microchip meets the requirements of medicine.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's attempt to also convert the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the microchip. The processing of one lock costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which kicks in when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit paid thousands of dollars to the taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern lawn, presenting American production, was to pay taxpayers 24 000 dollars. The information is evident from the military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was attraction at the event held at the White House on 17.7.2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials familiarized with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the display included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be replaced by a mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on a southern lawn for an “exceptional” event. This is evident from the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
“I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it, because it’s an extraordinary event that gets a lot of visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, who is the deputy commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17.7. at seven in the morning and the event would start at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would leave the scene only after the grassy field was emptied between six and nine in the evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service time restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's house when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIME magazine do not reveal whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event violated the law.
“One of our questions was whether this violated the Hatch Act. We were told not to be violated,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of the health care reform that was under the Senate proceedings at the time and looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from all 50 states,” said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 regularly make training flights in the Washington area and practice bringing the president to the White House with centimeters of precision on the southern lawn.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training sessions for the White House.
According to one official, the flights to Made in America included the crew's monthly training quota.
That day, the unit’s helicopters also flew for 11 hours on “non-presidential support missions.”
According to the White House, the incident did not cost taxpayers any other costs.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the helicopter's presentation on the White House's southern lawn.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly allowances for 2017, the replacement level of the VH-3D helicopter is 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
According to documents from the HMX-1 unit, the flights from the Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters said.
‘The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.’
According to a study conducted by the RAND research company in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to bring it up.”
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down at the scene of the fire truck driver.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. “I have three of them.”
Lightning hit the Vaasan railway - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical fault, says the Rail Traffic Centre.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The fault in the traffic control system was caused by thunder.
The Railway Centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
Venezuela's state prosecutor is demanding a right to block the appointment of the country's new council
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has filed a court order to prevent the appointment of a new council of representatives.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the council elected in last Sunday's vote is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a disputed vote, a council was elected for the country, which may, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the blocking decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the Representative Council vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated to the council, and the elected 545-member council of representatives includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to changing the constitution, the Council of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutionalization of Maduro as a way to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro argues that the new Council of Representatives is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
There have been several wounded and more than a hundred people have been killed.
Venezuela fell into economic crisis after oil prices dropped.
Now, many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to protest on Friday, when the new Council of Representatives is scheduled to begin.
Finnish-broken Russian man sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, a Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a claim from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities when he was about to return home.
Finland handed Senah to U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, according to the AFP news agency.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had gained the benefit of millions of dollars.
Senah was jailed for 46 months.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized Finland harshly after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
According to prosecutors, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the information to continue to direct internet traffic, which was used to carry out click-through scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the acting director of the Justice Department's criminal division, the incident shows that the U.S. is also capable of chasing cybercriminals operating in other countries.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.
Edited at 20:58: Corrected the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel takes the lead in Netflix's hit series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will feature the third and fourth seasons. The third season trailer has been announced and introduces the new villains of the series.
In the third season, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that there is a little more corruption and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is connected to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
In a newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, recruiting U.S. and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola will create an exceptional light artwork in Paris
The Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in the photo) will produce an exceptional light artwork to celebrate the first Day of Light, set by the UN, in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola makes a light artwork called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - the sun and the moon.
The UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it are illuminated.
I want to emphasize not only light, but also darkness.
Today, the light pollution of cities of millions is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I feel important visible in a concrete way, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am well honored by the invitation to be part of the first International Day of Light and to bring the light art to the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to recreate my art at UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanding significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in the parking garage of the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction of travel.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver, who was driving in a prohibited direction, swung the driver of the other car, as a result of which his car started to move, colliding with the batsman's car.
He then hit the hood of the car.
The man has admitted to causing the damage and wrongdoing.
Timo Soini titled the article: "After that, the Flood came"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (v.) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the deluge, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 17th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the deluge parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have been left with the phrases "after us the Flood" or "the Flood after me".
According to the United Nations, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim head of the UN Aid Embassy, said hundreds of women were nominated in the provincial council elections, three women running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban have made threats to the elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has passed from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the women's contribution will strengthen Afghan democracy.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the sights are rushed through in large numbers.
Venice is a stuff for quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move through the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center, while hotels have taken their place.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give two or three hours.
You follow the flag-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Market, and you turn back, describes Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini's prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the activities of the place, shops and workshops.
We must maintain this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The indignation of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50 000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2 000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was in the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the vessels bring the income it desperately needs to Venice and create a need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to make it possible for cruisers to go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is located, could have more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Every year, about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad traffic jams on the highway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the northbound lane has been traffic jams of kilometres during the return traffic on Thursday afternoon.
The area is undergoing motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
At the time of the roadworks, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual speed of 120 km/h.
However, even in the 50-kilometre restricted area, traffic had progressed at practically a walking pace in some places on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, roadworks proceeded on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the Revelation statue, the golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention
The 23-year-old has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published stunning photos of herself in the landscape of the Grand Canyon, among other things.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter race in March by orbiting the track lap at 51:81.
A month later, he improved the 400-meter hurdles at 55:38 of the Norwegian record.
Iuel, who is hard-working on social media, soon after his records, discovered that celebrity and publicity have their downsides.
Men from all over the world began to send Iue pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "smear pictures" from strangers, so I had to turn my account into a private one," Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received in the interview with VG.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when the Amalie was 2 years old.
When the Amals were 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of their father's work.
After that, it was time for Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussing than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask for anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally engage with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400 metres and the 400-meter hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korpi's entire career on the line - now participating in the World Championships: "Nice to not happen anywhere"
It's been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
One of Finland's most successful snowboarders, Janne Korpi, 31, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career was still at stake.
The stress injury to the foot was forced on Korpi's operating table in January, and the foot did not want to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the snowboarding would continue or not.
The sponsorships were on hold and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, that's how things work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back to the slope.
The decision was easy after that.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
I was like, damn, this is so much fun again, let's do a couple more seasons.
Korpi didn't get to count properly until September-October, but after a long recess, just training painless has been a big deal.
The competitions Korpi has only toured a few.
It's okay. It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of snowboarding for Korpi.
I've never counted because of one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're on a fever that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today Korpi will compete in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don't keep him on board, he always lights up when competing in tough company.
According to Korpi, the appreciation of the competitions organized by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some snowboarders chose the X-Games in Norway, which is held at the same time.
These are important races, the visibility is great.
However, I always think that appreciation depends on the circumstances and what the level of the competition is.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-person team in Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The team's youngest members, 17-year-olds Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to watch the younger friends go.
I remember when it was time to be new and so excited about everything.
It also brings new energy to myself, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up on the slopes, but otherwise I don't, there's that much power in my friends!
Behind the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korpi is addicted to horse racing: the rider has his own racehorses, for whom he makes training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, I don't have time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the trotting results and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korpi, horse racing and trotting coaching are a potential career plan when the snowboarding career is completed in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I try to stay on top of the time and develop, maybe even some departures in the summer.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The trotting activities also include the Elitloppet race with presenter Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The duo has rented a cruise ship heading to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to bring the old tradition back to life.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months left, let's hope we get the ship full, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's care home project in Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-bed elderly care home to be built in Kitee.
The building of more than 1 700 square metres of floor square metres is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbouring Terveystie road.
The common wonder of Kitee is what the new care unit has enough customers for, because now during Siun sote, many private nursing homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that there will be more demand for Kitee in the future, not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerikka from Kitee.
The transaction concerned business, but the property is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie’s factory in Scotland
The union is seeking confirmation from McVitie’s brand manufacturer’s leaders for long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish section of the British General Trade Union (GMB), the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns the McVitie’s brand, said it had invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be “will certainly be told first” if there are any changes in operations.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to “respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated to modernisation of production lines.”
Drew Duffy of the GMB Trade Union finds it very worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
“Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a significant employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihood.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and the continuous reduction of Brexit, rising living costs and production, eastern Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie’s production.”
According to a Pladis spokesperson, the factory manager had received a trade union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it values constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed several issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all of our businesses and locations to maintain our competitiveness.”
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production facility and will be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after paying a transfer of 189 million pounds to terminate the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the transfer world record. The previous record was less than half the record, which was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as PSG will offer him more than 500 000 pounds per week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be outraged by PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says the club has been very well taken care of by Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that they were interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking the best players in PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they want our players, we’ll become their opponents and we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona loses their star player Neymar because of this.

Now: Trump's phone calls were made up - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two of the calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Telephone calls from Trump with both the Mexican president and the head of the scouts' organization have proven to be made up.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said Trump didn’t lie.
According to Sanders, many of the scouts' leading figures spoke to Trump in person, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had discussed at the G20 in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty harsh accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, they just happened face-to-face," Sanders said.
The speech to the scouts sparked disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump for a successful eradication of illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people come across Mexico's southern border because they know the trip to the U.S. border is going to be a problem anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump praised his speech at a major meeting of the National Scouts' Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, a scout agency said it was not aware of any of its executives' phone call to Trump.
According to the statement, Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organization, a statement in which he had apologized to Trump's speech from the scouts, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the Scouts' Association aroused a lot of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
