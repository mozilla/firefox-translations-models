Kuopio and Juankoski will decide separately on the conduct of the next municipal elections.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski joined, Kuopio has a population of approximately 111,000.

At the top of the agenda are plans for expanded nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian forces shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kyiv's leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership in Kyiv does not want to engage in substantive political dialogue with the eastern part of the country, Putin said, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, which Kyiv and the West say are aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian forces away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian military forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed troops and their artillery so that they do not get a chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was surprising that people came already in the early evening.
The number of visitors during the two days was as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was organized for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be a hip-hop festival, so there will be no pop, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, a law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives will enter into force in Finland.
In future, private individuals will have to apply for a licence from the National Police Board to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as a precursor for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium chlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide can be found, for example, in cleaning products and detergents, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration driving.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of Nairn and Pitlochry hotel rapes
A trial awaits the accused of rape in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing at Glasgow High Court.
He is accused of rape at Pitlochryn Scotland's Hotel in County Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "while she is unconscious, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision for herself."
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will take place on November 17 in Edinburgh at the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shined - Mario overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
At just 19 years old, Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived at Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than he did during his time at Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his top form.
The Italian wasted three quality scoring opportunities and only half of his sixteen passes for his own team.
Pool supporters who have already favoured the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the club's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team's star was midfield diamond striker Raheem Sterling, who poked an important opening goal for the 3-0 win past Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli, is between the opponent's lines like a fish in water.
This feature is not common for players who speed around 34 kilometers per hour on the grass at best.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of credit for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman explained after the match how Liverpool have systematically developed the northwest Londoner, who grew up at the foot of Wembley, into a more comprehensive player than just a winger.
Susanna Mälkki appointed Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start in her new position happy and proud.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in Finland's musical life for over a hundred years, for example by premiere a large amount of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members in the past.
I look forward to our future collaboration," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations meet in pension negotiations - Finland - Regions - News - Karjalainen

Pihtipudas.
Rovaniemi-based women's volleyball league team Woman Volley stumbled upon league promoted Vampulan Urheilijat in the final of the Pihtipudas practice tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned a match that stretched into five sets into a 3-2 victory.
In the final set, WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead the whole time.
The fight was good, but in defensive play and pass play Vampula was slightly better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six was rickety in that 190-centimetre American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
The centre was Sara Niemi.
Despite her thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed the most firepower combination in WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparations for the league will continue next weekend when HPK from Hämeenlinna comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "School of Business" at 6 pm in an official practice game.
On Sunday, we will meet again at the Sports Institute.

Ovarian cancer is more common in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 per cent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Principal investigator Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the women's health history over a seven-year period.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socioeconomic status also affected the chances of survival.
Older women and when the cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis had the lowest probability of survival.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their practices are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although telemedicine is becoming more common and distance is becoming less important, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients being treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's research, women with ovarian cancer have poor long-term survival rates regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha TNeave, a 33-year-old mother living on the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to use the detailed plan to confirm snowmobile parking in Friendship Park, which is located next to Hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the detailed plan proposal for Friendship Park and its surroundings will be placed on public display at the service point Osviit.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Committee and the Lapland Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment.
With the detailed plan amendment, the city wants to enable tourism-related snowmobiling activities to continue in the area.
The plan is to create a park area on the site, which will include the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
According to the proposal, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently allowed at the site between 15 November and 30 April.
Refuelling points may also be located in a certain part of the area.
Service traffic will also be allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and the zoning change have aroused even loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring apartment buildings have been upset about both the sound and the emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been investigated and the reports have not revealed any observations exceeding the guideline values.
The renewed fleet is also lower in emissions than the old one.
Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were moved further away, the hotel's safari customers would have to be transported to the safari departure points by buses, of which there would be approximately 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the Friendship Park area and its surroundings are also large enough for snowmobiles, better than the places proposed as replacement starting points, such as the boat pier on the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
Due to its location, Friendship Park is also good because activities may expand to the Ouna pavilion area in the future, for example.
The establishment of parking operations is part of the City Strategy approved by Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City aims to create a good framework for business activities by reserving a sufficient number of high-quality areas in logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
Friendship Park has also been marked as a starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre's partial master plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the under-35 group, could lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of horticultural sales in terms of age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the UK.
According to a Financial Times report, renters spend only 55% of the money homeowners spend on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people are living in highly urbanised apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the horticultural sector, which is estimated to be worth around £5 billion a year.
In the greater London area, house ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest amount of money spent per household on horticultural products across the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Horticultural Society (RHS), an increase in housing rentals or a decrease in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, says that "plants grown in mobile growing containers, for example, are particularly popular with renters because such containers can be included in the move if needed".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the heyday of horticultural resale as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, after worse weather in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over espionage report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the report was discussed by the U.S. Embassy's chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and online newspaper The Intercept have reported that documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former analyst at the US National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main target of espionage by US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of the report, saying that all major nations have been spying on each other.
An earlier report of espionage on Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service provoked a angrier reaction from the Turkish government.

Magaluf police chief in Majorca accused of corruption
Those who denounced the case presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and Calvià City Council officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf district, known for its damp partying.
Superintendent José Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody after several Punta Ballena Street business owners filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena Street is home to most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who exposed the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and Calvià city council officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard on corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Mr Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angered by government bias, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You are not destroying our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video circulated online showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing oral sex with 24 men in a so-called "social media". during the pub crawl.
Since then, the island's authorities have been trying to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf's holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcohol-intoxicated pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to close for one year, and Carnage, the owner of the nightclub and the operator of the pub crawl, was jointly fined €55,000.
The popular tourist destination of Magaluf, especially among young British tourists, has also become popular in the so-called "tourist destination". Balconing trend, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol consumption, when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombarded communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting can still be seen.
At the Pashosh kindergarten in the southern city of Ashdod, workers removed shrapnel marks from walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the kindergarten.
"We're a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city's school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks returning to school after a long time feels "a little weird."
"We've had difficult times at times when we didn't leave home anywhere," she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire began, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and mortars.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are sceptical about returning after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "their education and safety will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the blockade of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt expects a new round of indirect negotiations to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the death toll. It said at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no conclusive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
In the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still sheltered and fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of school the week before.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives sheltering in a school in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used metric, house prices have risen by the most in seven years during Australia's winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic house price index, which measures house prices in Australia's capital, rose 1.1 per cent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
As a result of the rise, the rise in prices in June, July and August totalled 4.2 per cent, that is, more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual rise in prices was 10.9%, more than twice as much as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the list of price increases.
RP Data's results show that house prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin have the next busiest housing markets; The average price increase is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent in a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which will be a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in home sales at auction, the generally brisk pace of sales, and the still ongoing low level of interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise further over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record crowds to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
The Serlachius Art Museum has had more than 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has exhibited classics of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä Art Festival, on the other hand, announced on Monday that it had set a visitor record, with 14,500 interested visitors to the Hetkinen event this summer.
We are not used to such figures.
People have swept through doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums for the whole year will be close to one hundred thousand this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, Mänttä-Vilppula has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are phenomena whenever they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
Mänttä hopes that the art season will continue well into the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
The police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property on Pohjolankatu was broken into by breaking a window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a lorry's tank on Syväojankatu.
Between Sunday and Monday, a boat with outboard motors had been taken from Petäisenniska Marina.
The rowing boat was Kalapalta-branded, light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside was the inscription "OIVA" on the nose.
A couple of suspected thieves were already caught by the police.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
A police dog was tracked and a man in his twenties from Paltamo was found hiding under a fir tree in the forest.
On Monday, the police abducted another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought murder charges in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of just under ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Kajaani, whom he suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man who was with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car in which the party was burning clothes used in the bloodwork.
In addition to burnt shreds of clothing, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a judgment in the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August occurs on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me
Henry was born to seven children from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19. The relationship between son and father was distant.
Henry is currently rehearsing for Rudy's Rare Records, a comedy show based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father and developed based on a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap to an upbeat beat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother's death, and she reflects a lot on her relationship with her father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never visible, only a voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Go!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, would go to the pub with my father and discuss things like the shape of a pint of beer or the beauty of a cricket batting.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was to me the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, giving him an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are better today than they were then.
The smelters are a little brighter today, but they are basically dark, smoky, labyrinthine depths with flames, smoke and soot, reminiscent of hell.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the dirt from the melter away from himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to put food on our table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the intimacy provided by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started to get sick shortly before she died, that we started repeating to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep repeating "I love you"?
Stop hugging now!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She's a great mom
Henry is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started to suffer from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do an about-face.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his transformation during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics for her role as Othello, she has immersed herself in making theater.
Next up were the comedy of mistakes and August Wilson's Fences.
Making theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old as a factory worker.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned as he worked.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes off the conveyor belt from 1975 to 1985, while living stardom and being on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny at the New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show featuring people wearing black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and frowned upon, I got to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, perennial favourite and light entertainment show" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 80s on another comedy series that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the '90s, Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock on the sitcom Chef!
Henry spent the next decade in commercials, documentaries, TV series and film segments, but after his BBC TV series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just standing still or getting sidetracked."
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wear tights and have money.
Therefore, the subject of Shakespeare aroused fear in me.
Everyone we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Try it.
Don't dismiss the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Date the words and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was obviously expected to fail, but it didn't quite happen.
Soon after, Henry starred in the comedy Mistakes.
Suddenly, I was acting at the British National Theatre and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, a thought came to my mind: "Oops, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You've got to do 10 minutes on your own until the computer works again.' ”
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked off the stage, and part of me breathed a sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You are part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry in the play "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play, too, was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
This is what Henry says, of course, in a HOARSE voice.
So I decided to stick with this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comedian: little humorous chicks constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one imitation to another.
Refraining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it doesn't excite me as much as it used to.
I ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the entire journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting –
It's really fun.
When acting, a story is constantly being told, and I enjoy that role.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya draws up register of civil servants to eliminate 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun compiling biometric records of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive pay, the government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving their civil service posts.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to stamp out corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least one million dollars a month was spent on the salaries and other financial irregularities of "ghost workers."
The government suspects that salaries will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left his or her civil service position, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital Nairobi.
All civil servants will be required to register themselves in the next few weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, a government statement said.
According to the release, anyone who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector by determining how many people actually perform their duties. In addition, this will clean up payrolls at both levels of government. This will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official in the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
Seinäjoki's result for the 2015 financial year may show a deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual contribution margin will show a deficit of approximately EUR 9.4 million.
Possible measures to improve efficiency included compromising the scope and level of services, purchasing services, selling assets and subsidies, and increasing tax and fee revenue.
Of the EUR 10 million reduction target for investments, EUR 8.5 million has been reached.
There will be no relief for municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a five per cent cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Board is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned towards the goal set out in the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals to the management team for preparation.
The City Board's proposals will form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through committee consideration to the City Board and City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of 'plotting' against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots", local media sources said.
Police officials did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some police officers were linked to last December's corruption investigations targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large criminal racket and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said the police actions were part of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen's planned actions against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he is committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who works as a leading teacher at the Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will be useful to them in the future.
Celebrations on the first day of school traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry, Texas, said the defamatory tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry's verified Twitter account posted a defamatory photo Sunday night of a Democratic district attorney amid allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another tweet in which Perry vowed he had nothing to do with the image.
The tweet was sent without permission from my account.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it," a later post said.
Perry's backers did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
While the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon of Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was indicted. Perry is a potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet read: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as allowed... But when that happens, I accuse Governor Perry of pointing fingers."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Office did not lead the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
The investigation was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antionio-based special prosecutor assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the allegations a political ploy.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the charges, saying the law under which Texas' longest-serving governor is impeached is unclear when mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector allegations, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning follow-up group to issue a formal complaint.
Perry's verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa caucus during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end in a tie by posting a photo on Twitter of himself jogging on the lake with the caption "Here we come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says housing market is "normal" again
One of London's main developers has warned that the housing market in the south-east of England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital London have been plagued by huge demand and soaring prices, amid fears of a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-end developer Berkeley, said Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and transaction volume have returned to normal after the 2013 peak," adding that this has allowed for a "stable operating environment."
London's housing market was doing well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to land registry data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, well above the England-Wales average of 6.7%.
Average selling prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months – some interest has also been driven by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "mansion tax" ahead of May's general election.
London-based estate agent Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage report, which announced stricter lending regulations, would lead to lower levels of market growth, both in terms of property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh Bank of England data showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for London property prices. According to the report, prices are falling by three per cent because the index measuring homeowners' opinion of prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of deals made in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter from a year ago, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, which increased revenue from properties sold to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, right-of-the-kind product in prime locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained buoyant."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes the year before April. This is almost a third more than during the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year to £380 million and revenue increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full-year pre-tax profit is £450 million.
Berkeley stock sold steadily at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker claiming to hold photos of a hundred other stars leaked Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's snapshots online.
A representative for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for a "brazen invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will face charges.
The images, which were originally published on the 4chan image publishing page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of a hundred other stars targeted by the hack allegedly includes dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is unknown how much of the images are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those looking at the pictures my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you guys are in good spirits," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images, tweeting that "these so-called nude photos of me are FAKE, don't you understand".
Let me nip this in the bud.
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that a representative for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of photos of the star.
An excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "j"
They dissolved, it best described what had happened, gradually they broke apart like a cardboard box left outside in the rain.
Only now and then did he hear from her that he was too serious, awkward, intense, detached, and maybe a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the prickly.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The most recent victim of his barbs had been an early relationship, which, however, had been promising; It had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might even have brought some substance into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north that was even more rugged and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern assumed was her aunt. Her aunt had inherited a house in a humid but paradisiacal valley, and the valley was aptly called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, slugs had left their mark on the windows, considering the whole place their own, weeds were growing in the garden, resembling giant heads of cabbage.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, menacing and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
Told by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
The nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on broken terrace chairs amid the long grass, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both absentmindedly listening to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news as Ailin's crossed, sun-tanned legs reminded Kevern of a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and often listened to by his father through the venetian blinds of the cabin down.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were inherently too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren't banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to forget them, as did the word oblivion.
Public opinion accomplished what laws and excommunication had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read memoirs, cookbooks and romances of heroes, in music, they preferred ballads.
Driven wild by the day, Kevern began keying on an imaginary piano and singing a serenade to Ailin's big feet in a cheekily comic voice.
Ailinn did not understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between her and her father when she was little.
His father said he played the same game as his own father.
If you let out a word that starts with a j and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz hadn't really been banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was wit presented through music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
An obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude—gratitude, that they had been spared luck—the principle that each group did things inherent in it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of Afro-Caribbean ancestry were best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to get things done.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; The last Greeks broke plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, came true, those from the Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly for fear of being accused of blazing the flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and smoking hookah, and went on living with their eyes fixed on the ground and depressed with boredom.
Let everyone act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for her to understand how the hurtful words Kevern had just sung could ever have been dressed up as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for the Bigfoots.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
Not a single word would pass through the soundproofing of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips in the company of Ailin.
Ailinn thought he was strange even now.
"Dad thought it was amusing," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair obscured Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing else to see in the world other than Ailin's huge, crow-black tuft of hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say that," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
However, that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankles, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It was just a silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm perverted in that sense.
This did not help.
He had wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father had meant to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her terrace chair, knocking down the receiver and spilling the wine they had just drunk.
Even the wine was made only from elderflowers, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he would punch?
He had never told Kevern about life in the freezing northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been like life here.
The same huge, icy sea that rippled against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more diabolical than their smuggler and scatter grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He would still see a thick fist if he were not careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word used to describe erotic encounters between a man and a woman; The antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, as the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window, a man who was himself responsible for his hard life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands to strike him.
A back-turned, bowed, shameful, defeated man who had lost all will to fight—why did he feel so familiar with the sight, even though he couldn't remember ever seeing such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at Ofnow, a private institution measuring public opinion, conducted a brief study of the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in those areas of the country where it was most likely to decrease, or even stop, given the money and energy spent on eradicating it.
"Much has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "to offset the inherent aggression of a people who have fought and mostly won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite church towers extending over hedgerows, human gentleness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it generates.
The people weep over sentimental ballads, devour stories of overcomes, swear by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty grips both rural communities and urban communal neighbourhoods relentlessly, and there is evidence of a new, more evil-minded will to quarrel in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her gaze to the ground.
Also, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Ms Esme continued to invoke her right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
No prejudice is maintained in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you have just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the Church—and what you call cruelty or evil-mindedness, others usually call innate energy and physical strength.
Saying WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed the instruction Ofnow had been distributing to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a low voice when she was sure her mentor had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I worry that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
This time, though, we're not pouring out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "in describing as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You're also going too far when you say they poured out their 'anger and distrust of others.'"
Someone in a position like you shouldn't have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we're not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' and no 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say that it has behaved well.
I am not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
That was then.
There is no need to say more about that – we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to hand out accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is some way of making them.
But what is the past for, then, if lessons are not learned--
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, indicating that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist riding on the sidewalk, whose ride passers-by described as "evil-minded and furious."
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho army denies planning the attack; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied staging the attack to overthrow the government and said they were working against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had besieged his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighbouring South Africa after being told that he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said the army was responding to a threat emanating from "political fanatics." The police are said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause trouble," he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the army's actions looked like an attempted revolution.
"Although no one has claimed to have overthrew the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces appear to correspond in all respects to the hallmarks of an attempted revolution," he says.
Lesotho military officials said soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have been raging in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements within the Grand Coalition government.
He thus denies having disparaged the power of the government, despite claims to the contrary.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to establish a data center in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has established a large data center in Uusimaa in a location whose location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the location of the centre had previously been predicted to be Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will completely close its Oulu office, which will take jobs from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's Communications Director, told STT that the company would not comment on how many employees the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data center in Uusimaa was reported on Monday by Kauppalehti.
Man accused of running over girl at traffic light intersection

According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 carelessly and caused injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at a Dundee sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I actually took these photos at a family gathering using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure that the camera battery and other parts are sealed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the photos or video you are taking.
Some cameras or camera/camcorder combinations have a setting to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can go.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60 feet deep.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple shots – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often don't have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows bracketing, which means taking multiple shots at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light is significantly reduced at a deeper depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This will also add more color to your photos; The deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Try to get close to the subject being photographed.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater, as light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, which means that the photographer must be close to the subject in order to fill the entire image, including the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders – protesters vow revenge
China's parliament ruled on Sunday that Hong Kong's voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was announced.
The decision of the Chinese National People's Congress effectively gives the communists the power to weed out any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says Democratic Party leader and lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary general of China's National People's Congress committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidacy to elect Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that it would be able to choose its own leaders from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to tightly control the electoral process through an appointment committee administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region in years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely run by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business quarter if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was announced, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the rally, organizers announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and would spark waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing it would lead to problems with authorities.
In a statement posted online, organizers said the movement "considers the Occupy Central stunt to be a last resort, which will only be deployed if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been lost and the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings. Among other things, police and barricades were present.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fuelled by the feeling among many that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood – the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it takes," says lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media have also reported that Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists are henchmen of revolutionary Western powers."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
US prom tradition hits British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing Britain's first luxury mode of travel for today's students.
In addition to private jets, the company also offers other means of transport, such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise be dragging their belongings across the country in overloaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF (VIP friends) features, we are ready to provide today's students with the easiest and highest quality transportation to the university.
According to a company spokesperson, bookings have not yet been received as the service is newly established, but added that "students will start placing orders in the next few weeks."
The company believes there is demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 per year tuition fees.
In terms of their expectations and aspirations, today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now more than ever, it's important to make a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's higher education section, "this service plan seems very far removed from the lives of the majority of students."
Many students starting their studies this month are shocked by the cost of living as financial support in the form of loans and scholarships has lagged behind the staggering rise in the basic cost of living. Only then can we start thinking about where to find thousands to spend on something as simple as arriving on campus.
Ipswich "pig house" for sale
The estate agents removed the sale photo of a house for sale in Suffolk after noticing that the picture shows a large pig lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where a pig was leaning its head against the sofa.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the image ended up in the ad by mistake and has since been removed," says a company spokesperson.
In the listing, Connells describes the former convention house as "a unique one-bedroom house."
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has aroused interest on social media, where people have asked whether a pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish striker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement stepped in with almost the same opening of the door.
Chelsea announced that they have signed French striker Loic Remy from neighbouring club QPR on a four-year contract.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, joins AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50m four years ago but never lived up to expectations.

As expected, Kagawa returns to Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU transfer.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's new contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be a Dortmund man again.
This is a great team and an amazing environment," Kagawa said.
Another Bundesliga club from Berlin, Hertha, is strengthened by Salomon Kalou.
The Ivory Coast international striker will move to Hertha from French side Lille and the transfer fee is estimated at around €3 million.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played for Chelsea from 2006-12.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
Salary increases are also due to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the prison workers' organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate-General for Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
Members of the Workers' Trade Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protest.
Basketball: Fan cheers almost too much: Sasu Salin had to faint on the court
Basketball Sasu Salin was the epitome of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch-black USA game and beat the blood-stopping decisions of Ukraine in the second half.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans - and did it in style:
I almost fainted on that pitch at the end, the encouragement was so great.
My eyes just blurred, I couldn't help it.
The noise and the white crowd was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, possessions, rebounds and scramble everywhere he happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere somewhere, now in an insanely important place, Sasu enthused.
That is my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others were able to catch up with the plot as well.
It infected the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and lifesaver, so it's no wonder that his example took the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big, heavy-handed Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a break of 32 years: The previous ones left me with an outrageous refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 World Cup tournament in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's national volleyball team played in a World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali was the all-rounder.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a red-hot match against France in the preliminary round.
"In the deciding balls of that match, the refereeing game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already lined up on the back line.
Suddenly, the game resumed.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world champions when the World Cup tournament in Poland gets underway today, Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The strength values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average height of players has also increased.
The game is faster than before," Parkkali mused.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded, and the strain can be shared.
I expect Finland to advance from the preliminary round.
Then things can get tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on the strike in the victorious match against Tunisia.
The current player's agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-around player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope that we now climb to 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," Parkkali said.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö fanned in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotional at the Seamen's Church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Championships.

The finalists will record the songs of the competition.
Competition moments always leave great memories, Immonen says.
Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all praise"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook post that Cita, the dog who was in the mountains with him on Thursday, hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to coax and pull it forward a bit, but its legs just didn't carry," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help came from the police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
As the evening grew darker, the situation began to look threatening.
Luckily there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Galdhøpiggen, Norway's highest mountain, and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm considering the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanomat.
Soon a German man with a camping mattress with him also arrived.
From the mattress to the Cita we got stretcher-like ones to which the injured dog was attached.
A German man arrived a moment after us had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope in his arms for a while," Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically strenuous, but carrying in difficult terrain went slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, the Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for "international heroes" to thank them once again.
The Soins replied to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, to whom I am eternally grateful.
On the night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: "Cita is already feeling better!

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death due to a misdiagnosis.
For most of her youth, Karin Rodgers thought she only had a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a group of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and curled toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be confined to a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I was never able to roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. During the surgeries, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers that said he had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would be confined to a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose my full functionality.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his gait had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl baby, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair".
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they explained to me what CMT was, I thought I put it off," she says.
Charity CMT UK – organises CMT Month to draw attention to the condition.
One hundred migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal migrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles in central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about EUR 3 000 each to enter Greece, and another EUR 800 to 900 to reach Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, a country of a few million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scots.
In the past, actor Sean Connery, among others, has given his support to independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In polls, supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in midsummer - Domestic News - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline in department store sales continued also in July, says the Finnish Grocery Trade Association.
According to the survey, the turnover of department store and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than twelve months back.
Sales of home and leisure products have been the worst affected, as turnover fell by over seven per cent year-on-year.
Clothing products also sold clearly less well than in the previous summer.
By contrast, the value of retail sales of daily consumer goods grew in July by nearly three per cent year-on-year.
Sales grew most in small shops and large supermarkets.
Throughout the first half of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent.
By contrast, sales of daily consumer goods have grown by nearly one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto third reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project have mainly been due to the approval of the reactor's automation systems.
The project is already years late.
In May, TVO did not provide any estimate of the completion time of the third reactor.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of waterfront plot to Bottas - worth approximately 60,000 euros
The municipal board of Nastola donated to formula one driver Valtteri Bottas a 1.4-hectare waterfront plot on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Villähtee.
The municipal board showed fair sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
On Bottas' gift plot there are farm buildings - seven in total.
The municipality will demolish all but one of them this year.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the site within two years.
We are honoured that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to be here in the future as well.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to talk about his sports career and life.
And hopefully it will continue to be," says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the monetary value of the waterfront plot to be between 40,000 and 60,000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has, with varying degrees of success, kept those who have succeeded in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World champion in javelin throw Aki Parviainen and aerobics world champion Tuuli Matinsalo received plots for detached houses from the municipality and built magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola and sold their property and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then moved elsewhere when their life situation changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syrac says, believing Bottas will stay in his home municipality.
Hull sign striker Hernandez for a club-record sum
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay international Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez is switching to Hull from Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or around €12 million.
The contract is for a period of three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B and were promoted to the Italian top flight.
For the Uruguayan national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
At last summer's World Cup finals, Hernandez came on as a substitute in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short period of time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said they had also signed Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russian space test failed - geckos sent on sex trip died
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia to reproduce have died, the Russian Federation space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geckos travelled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and behavior of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
Through the effects on geckos, we can try to predict what kind of effects weightlessness would have on people staying in a similar state for longer periods of time, the New Statesman illustrated in July.
According to Roscosmos, the date of death of the geckos and the cause(s) of death will be determined.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers dubbed "sex geckos" froze.
Another sign of surprise is that the fruit flies on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities made the announcement on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track down the man after he used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told authorities that the family was not related in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is originally from Chechnya but now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had monitored the man's actions before.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people lured into the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that around 800 French citizens or persons registered in France have travelled to, returned or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team's hopes of an extra place are in the game when Finland faces Ukraine in their second game of the World Cup today.
If the opening defeat to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the victories needed for the second place.
Ukraine is a good team, but I believe that we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the World Cup on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the hundred-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter threw in 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defense right," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in yesterday's defeat to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that we will see a normal pack of wolves on the field, Möttölä said.
Alleged snapshots of Hollywood stars go viral online - some verified to be genuine
A number of nude photos are circulating on the Internet, allegedly depicting well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has fallen victim to a "snapshot" campaign.
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts (on the Internet) Stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos circulating of her are genuine.
She had taken those photos years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the horrific effort that went into this.
I sympathise with everyone who fell victim to the hack," he writes, according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says images under her own name are fake.
Genuine or fake nude photos are also circulating of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS game illustrate well the club's confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeping coach for four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the struggle that ended in a 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the poor defensive play.
Player traffic has been busy at Honka this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed frequently.
Player roulette has also given many young players opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here one day," Viitala snorted, without naming any individual players.
Honka's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed with Viitala to some extent.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a Veikkausliiga player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that you can't expect immediate success from players when their teammates are constantly changing.
There has not been twice in a row the same lineup this season.
Especially on the defensive end, people have changed.
That's the biggest reason why we're where we're today," Kuqi said.
After the VPS defeat, Honka is a serial jumbo, tied on points with penultimate TPS.
There are still seven rounds of Veikkausliiga left, so the Espoo residents still have time to avoid relegation to Ykkönen.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop now.
We are definitely not going to drop out of this league," goalkeeper Viitala said.

Perspective on the howling of wolves: How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played France in the European Championship finals at the Maroussi ball hall in Athens.
Pehkonen was not exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the hundred or so Finns who shouted noise in the otherwise empty hall, which drew 20,000 spectators.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine match at the World Cup?
In Bilbao, the number of one hundred Finnish fans is eighty times higher.
Euro 1995 was a time of search for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by beating, among other things, Russia in a qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Centre.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann lifted Möttölä to the finals team with lime lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, even if not everything went according to script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
As far as is known, there were slightly over a hundred Finns present at the Athens Games.
That group included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao too, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I don't think anyone can say the exact number of Finnish competitors.
Estimates have hovered between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number in between, it's an unimaginable amount.
Here's what sports sociologists need to explain.
In a global global economy, companies are moving across borders.
In sport, there is still a chance to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit and see how our girls and boys are doing in the world, says Professor of Sociology of Sport Hannu Itkonen.
Certainly, both in Spain and at the Volleyball World Championships in Poland, there are Finns looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
Still, it doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself must also have appeal.
Itkonen makes sports a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports competitions than going to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses still cannot be mobilized.
Let's go back to 1995.
Back then, head coach Dettmann challenged the Finnish Basketball Association and the players to throw themselves into elite sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and national team activities were put on a pedestal.
The volleyball crowd made the same move a little earlier.
Now both are enjoying the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have succeeded in productising their top sports, where the holy trinity operates: sports-media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalistic advocacy is, Itkonen points out.
Will ball sports be able to transfer this massive interest to domestic leagues as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would bode well for the species.
Another school of thought believes that interest will shift.
The second is the one who doesn't want a sweet tooth full of stomachs.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not doubly interesting.
It's a challenge for socialites in the midst of the frenzy.
Securing the Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas with a waterfront plot.
The municipal board unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
A holiday home will be built on the plot in the future.
Nastola has followed Bottas' success since his karting days.
He is considered a good ambassador for marketing Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in the area that are ready for demolition, six of which the municipality will demolish at expense by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved his fourth podium finish in the Belgian Formula 1 race this year.
He is fifth in World Cup points.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived his childhood in Villähtee.
He currently lives in England but visits Nastola whenever he is free from Formula One.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth centres.
Designer smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently demonstrating and testing them at the ongoing U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart jerseys are tested by ball people on the court, but amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players, also holds one.
According to him, the shirt helps him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into the nylon shirt, from which information is transmitted to the mound on the shirt and from there on to a smartphone or tablet.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The mound, which acts as a central unit, is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact time when the shirt will go on sale, nor has it even hinted at its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company investing in smart clothing.
California-based Athos has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, respiration and muscle work.
Clothes cost a hundred dollars apiece, and the thumb-sized CPU they require costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about technobytes.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who will soon be entering his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which students in later years borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them right away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for the whole semester and a hearty sandwich," says Schroeder, a 19-year-old student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his books from last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board of Trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but there are many ways for students to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing to use online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying significantly less for it than students who buy it.
According to Neebo Inc, a company that operates more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the industry reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores this spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Shopping
In online stores, you can get a new book for only a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended retail price for the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but the book Chegg.com available online is $239.99.
Used Buy
Used books are a good option if the reader is not distracted by the notes and worn appearance of others.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be obtained second-hand from Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's final-year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" second-hand on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
When new, the book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 percent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for an entire semester costs about $20.
Review the rental company's rules, including fees for notes, highlighter use, and wear.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return a book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Purchasing e-books instead of regular paper ones may also be an option.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the holder is paid for the right to use the e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
At Chegg, you can get "Calculus" as an eBook for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics today can be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It's worth comparing different sellers, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book ISBN to find out the price to make sure you're looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he had bought was on hold for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Almost double the number of people killed in fires this year compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have died in 49 different fires so far.
In the corresponding period last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of the deceased, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the situation was last worse in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other detached houses.
Spek reminds us to review fire safety at home.
According to Spek, at least the functionality of all smoke alarms in the home should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that first-aid extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed escape route from all areas of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they are allowed to use when they are home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of the city of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called "Summer Festival". counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had come as far away as Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Relatives became concerned about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party consisting of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for the youths, and the duo was found around 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Officers spent the night with the couple and they were lifted to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were given the order to retreat.
Ukraine says paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to an army spokesman, the opposing side's artillery fire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
Over the past day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery hits yesterday in the Sea of Azov off southeastern Ukraine sank in the morning, according to the border guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Patrol was not sure where the vessel was fired from.
The separatists said yesterday on social media that they had fired on the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not invade Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should lead to an immediate unconditional ceasefire.
Lavrov also reiterated that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First of all, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners," Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets were flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains lashed southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars.
Authorities estimated on Sunday that it may take time for the flooding to subside, although rain was forecast to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was issued in advance.
Ari Mustala, meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder if it has been difficult to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France," Francois Hollande's chief supporter says
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" for the ailing socialist president, whose new cabinet composition failed to win the approval of the majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said, earning a round of applause.
In a reassuring gesture, the prime minister called on the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour workweek alone, despite a controversial suggestion by new economy minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work in concert with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused controversy by appearing at a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the continuing discord among socialists and said she did not believe the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by phone, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and considered it certain that his party would win early elections and that he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in March's municipal elections, and the far right held the top spot in May's European elections.
According to an opinion poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several rival groups before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeded in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to notice quickly that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka disappointed Good morning Finland's hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda badly in the recorded part of the programme.
Last Thursday, the Good morning Finland programme published a funny video on its Facebook page about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Huomenta Suomi advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording doesn't quite go smoothly.
Alm-Siira gets confused in his words when he tries to pronounce the word budget session, and his freak out also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their pomp time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow as well, says the Facebook update of Good morning Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at Lehtikuva's photo agency, came third in the portrait category in 1972.
Pictured is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Builders' House on Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given just over five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four or five feet away.
The light and background were on point.
Immediately I understood that this time I succeeded.
You can see from Meir's expression that Middle Eastern leaders have had a hard time before.
At that time, pictures of well-known people or events succeeded in the competition.
It's great that nowadays you can succeed with other images as well, as long as you have an idea and visual contortion.
This is the second best photo I've taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash photo from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't submit that to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Narcotics Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation on computer science at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the supervision of the legality of police activities and crime prevention in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and court proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive oversight of legality.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special press release on the wall of the Naistenmatka school in Pirkkala caused a food stir on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the menu do we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old bulletin forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The picture that has gone viral on social media has prompted people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Services, tells Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was once an idea like this, which was discussed with health care at the time.
Each student gets a meal according to their wishes," he tells Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, pupils are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or public health nurse on a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the decision to Yle by saying that young people's experiments with vegetarian food may leave nutrition inadequate, and the absence of meat or chicken may cause wonder from the pupils' parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL. O, the world's third-largest cruise line, is in talks to buy rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for three billion dollars. The information comes from persons closely involved.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, with a market cap of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and wealthy customers as it continues to compete with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL. N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO. N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations are not taking place in public.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, and an Apollo spokesperson declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when revenue was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was $1.2 billion, up six percent from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle classes in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the number one choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's stock since the 2007 deal, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current line-up in 2000 through a merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL). The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, Genting's stake in the company was 28 percent, Apollo's 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP's stake 8 percent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The Tampere City Board will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Board will strongly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the era of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end soon.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread perception around the world that keeping advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
I hope that this view will also be conveyed to Tampere.
The closure of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin reinforces the demands for dolphinarium operations to be shut down.
Näsi's death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start investigating how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the remaining dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience life other than the unstimulated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The aim of the Finnish Association for Animal Welfare Animalia is that the use of all wild animal species in circuses would be banned in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act that is currently being prepared.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support the demand, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins to be held today, 1.9.
A demonstration at the Embassy of Japan in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season starting in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that Ukraine's government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the secession region, Russian news sources reported.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position inside Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev regime to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equal interlocutors is in line with his obvious strategy that he has been pursuing since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists seize the region, thereby forcing the Ukrainian Government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossiya independence that will allow it to turn towards Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with State TV channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to retake the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the region "Novorossiya", "New Russia" – a term reminiscent of the glory days before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks were an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians ran campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attacked civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of Southeast Ukraine. This takes into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
Peskov said Putin's reference to "statehood" relates to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with Kyiv's leadership as it tries to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need," Peskov said.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
Interjection by a Kremlin spokesman aimed at correcting a "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments stressed that the Russian regime is treating the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently than it did in Crimea, effectively occupying a region where the majority of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, given that the majority of the 6.5 million people living there are not ethnically Russian and because, according to opinion polls before the conflict, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give Ukraine's local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto power over the territory linking Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historical coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea in Russia, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers – after new elections – consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of regions that are different from Ukraine's core region over their own economies and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatists perhaps armed and fomented by Moscow.
Putin's latest demand to the Kyiv government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Sea of Azov.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the city of Novoazovsk by Russian-backed separatists is the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and a narrow area of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke Saturday in Brussels to European Union leaders pleading for further action to prevent further Russian violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; leaders called for additional sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian tank detachments and 1,000 soldiers moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce struggling separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters Saturday in Kyiv.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers besieged by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese talent Keisuke Honda already in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari scored first and Jeremy Menez a little later from the penalty spot.
Lazio also got a penalty in the closing moments of the game after their narrowing goal, but Antonio Candreva's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Diego Lopez.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of former Milan striker icon Inzaghi, the San Siro stadium was only half full.
The attendance for the match was announced as 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko caught up in nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed outrage after hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the internet following a widespread celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence, as well as other superstars such as supermodels Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "this is sickening."
All personal contact and photos should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is based in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online newspaper as "disgraceful" and said the victims "feel disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film credits include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ that "this is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen got angry with the hacker in a tweet: "Posting pictures stolen from a cell phone is no different from selling a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, if only from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if on its home turf and emerged with a sensational victory over Cuba at the Volleyball World Championship.
Check out the pictures of the fan frenzy.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, Finland's victory was watched by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like playing at home.
That's how big an impact the fans had on our game," Finland captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already down 0-2 in the match, but rallied to win 3-2.
In the fourth period, Finland made a miracle surge from behind six points.
Cuba already led the set 16-10, but after that the Finns got into a frenzy.
However, a couple hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an airport charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
