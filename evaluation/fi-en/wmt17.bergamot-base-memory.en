28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, “His business was finally going well.”
The body, which was found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-born Frank Galicia, the San Francisco medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was set as a homicide and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line chef in Boston, had had his dream job as a line chef at the San Francisco restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “horrified and shocked” by his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close-knit family, and he’s going to be missed very much,” the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at hostels at the beginning, but that recently “his business was finally going well.”
“He found an apartment and dated a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, to make dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shined brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone who has any information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Demands for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to accept new industrial action in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is requesting the entire Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to take up concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with the BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the board had remained “stubbornly silent” about issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to be empowered to the gradual and expanding industrial action programme, which will begin in early September.
The dispute has resulted in medical trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA's medical trainees, doctor Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms negotiated with the agreement, the conditions recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 54 000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was a good one and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A gesure that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle between words and economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile seemed forced, and he hardly exuded heat, even according to his own restrained norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke about his “dear friend” Putin – five times, according to a report.
I went crazy on the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the general public in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led to an astounding, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only made because Putin received the request of an apology from President Erdoğan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on a truce for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown in last month's failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also a financial motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” as the report of the Vedemosti newspaper said.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Add to that a long-lasting resentment from the snail's rapidly progressing EU membership negotiations, Putin emerges, eager to take advantage of the coolness and undermine Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, who has his own deep-rooted fear of a transition of power.
So this meeting in the blader seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce a “consortium of outsiders”, as one analyst described to me: two countries that feel abandoned by the West and mistreated them, uniting their power.
However, the two have major disagreements, despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but in which Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be a lot to talk about that after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the presidents told the press that they hadn't even dealt with it.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are even on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s strategists have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used by Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of the head office and stock exchange listings, will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we are now becoming much more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue the Six Nations sponsorship and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
The dettor sprays the champagne after a double win with a total of 3000 wins
Rival Frankie Dettori secured her 3000th British victory at the Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second victory of the night on his home track, competing in the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettor, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, “This is special.”
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The dettor sucks cheers into himself when he leads Predilection out after the victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in the steeplechases - the master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9x Derby Winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical stunt sets him apart in the other weighing room.
He is a wonderful ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden the 6000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and a big race jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but on top of that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flying landing from the saddle.
From voluntary endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
It's been a roller coaster.
Heaps of wins in the big races, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from competition because of drugs.
Three years ago, he initially struggled to return after a six-month ban, but he showed significant strength in character when challenging the skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to step down from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration," but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later led the president's protocol and board staff, according to the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served on the Soviet security service KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff pulled aside at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been very sceptical.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Putin, Ivanov said “it is true that early in 2012, in a discussion, I asked you to give me this very complex, jobful, task, to give me four years of responsibility.
Well, now I’ve been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov approved the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy leader.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia Putin after the second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after beating the producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute on the set in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and a quarrel on the set.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI agent team will be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it my fullness for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The start of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sweets that the vortex has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film footage of the sight in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The 1.35 billion pound project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry overpass and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the ‘deck fans’ that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 rhogue ropes.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all proving a truly impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel have been used to build this section of the bridge alone.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme dimensions of precision must fit together.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover of the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lockdown in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of the civil engineering.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and combined with the expanding north pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the north side, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway ground bridge 700 millimetres in the south direction.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the ground bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at a slope angle of about 3%.
Demanding, because the permissible dimensional deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, just a few millimeters in both directions.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are ‘lucky to be alive’
The three men are “lucky to be alive” after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station sounded the alarm at 13:20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperately trying to swim to safety as their boat continued on their own.
“We saw the boat circle closer to the men and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, the helmsman of the Moelfre lifeboat.
“Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got going,” he added.
A local fishing boat saved two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhaustedly hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill-breaker rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been worrying about teenagers and children no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some activity.
The screening time was originally limited to TV, then to video games and now to smartphones recently.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity aren't mutually exclusive.
I refer to a craze called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later, they became a cartoon series, playing cards, and other follow-up products).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
How does it work, then?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked with GPS, and which can be “photographed” after discovery (using a phone screenshot) or “catch.”
A generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the “average person”.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns’ calls for “find 30”, “get up on the couch” and “be active every day” have not yielded any result because most of the public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly, people who exercise have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse for this list.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how the three pillars of health are covered: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving buzzkills are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could be used to monitor activity, they didn't give a reason to move around the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and use will eventually subside.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape, and healthier.

Simone Biles won gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of that.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match title on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the end world in the Olympic spotlight.
He scored a total score of 62.198 clearly better than the silver medallist and “Final Five” teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States at the balance boom in the final of the women's gymnastics multi-match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win a multi-match title in a row, and a fifth American champion in all. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his to the same class as the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to the next level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose ambition and precision has been so stunting that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
The final test awaited Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning to the family's home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals, would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the final of the women's multi-match of the women's gymnastics in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, when he was the culmination of the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - one of his trademark flip-offs - is adapted for Latin American music that would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and whom was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerhouse.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to last as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the sole, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He climbed to the top with a boom point of 15:433 and crossed them by getting 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - the mere formality - and the tears rose to the eyes of Biles in glitter red, white and blue, when the dream of which he once wrote in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of a rematch from four years ago, when he was in shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who Americans call the “Grandma,” was clearly in the lead.
He sent kisses of flights to the public after his performance in emotional turmoil about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old's widespread tweet from this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killing were shot while listening to music in the car
In the deadliest attack of the first serial killer of the last decade in Phoenix, two women and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car chatting and listening to music when they were shot. This was reported in a police statement released on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. On June 12, Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot in a car parked on the driveway.
The shotter, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired a handgun up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple shooting does not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the other adult victim had 2900 dollars.
Phoenix Police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to see if it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over a four-month period, carried out in two mainly Latin American districts.
“These are happening in a residential area in front of a home,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interconnected and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police bulletin for the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple shooting and targeted an empty truck. This is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet sockets, bullet seats, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: ‘The situation will ease’
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike much of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise this.
Which is not true at all – of course I promised,” he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walkway.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund invented signs sign for “sing to me.”
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he says that Edmund has come up with some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or the Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction in a while, because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation will be easier.
You can believe that the situation will get better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their edges and caused widespread flooding due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to the counties in need.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's security and emergency preparedness office, said they receive requests for high-rise vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangisaho County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is in place until Saturday in much of the southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five centimetres more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said there was a threat of flooding the Ascension County by the river below, as flooded rivers slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Lousiana, was at the highest ever level on Friday morning at 9pm.
Rescuers are still picking people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which normally is more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He says the other stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up, and the water just kept going,” Hansford said.
It reached all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had not seen the water in the stream so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members are all injured, and that he is the only one with swimming skills.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescuers stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are “fading rapidly” as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with the heavy rain that had been going on since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a member of the city council said that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The district chairman, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets left to be surrounded by high tide.
Protective shelters have been opened in the towns of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
“They’ll be able to go back to their homes when the water starts to set,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, about twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The latest major flood here was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administrative official.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager of Harrison County, said that the steady rain continued off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have flooded on Thursday, but so far no floods have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, the head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain still goes on.”
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was ‘full of bullets’, survives the Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot dead in Philadelphia, which means the shooting of another six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand, and stomach, among other things, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his small body was full of bullets,” the boy’s grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgeries have been performed on him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start the first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car, along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia it looks like there was a cross between several shooters.
The attack weapon-type shell casings, which originate from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
“So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat,” Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and, according to the information received, the police are investigating the CCTV footage.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in her hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I'm calling this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team will look, finally, from America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
Oh, this is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they play unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the pinnacle of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all walked the same path Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the “Final Five” (the last five) because in the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the gymnasts team, and this is Marta Karolyi’s last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, train in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, and for families) and the list continues.
A large part of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics coaching to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Latin) and we have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's awesome.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girlpower” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical trainees organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58 % of the 37 000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was “on unknown ground,” and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to the nightly and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Medical Interns' Committee, said in a statement last night: “Medical trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular the fact that it is accelerating the existing labor crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally.”
When the time before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement, only eight weeks remain, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's unwillingness to participate and, at times, deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt should act now, lift the sanction and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he does not, then the doctor's trainees are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace the doctors on the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for those under the contract with 54 000 medical trainees.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of the NHS Employers Employers, appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “The labor battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in the demanding situation, as well as causing concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that a constant positive discussion of other important topics - such as development, the flexibility of education, additional training for those returning from Sabbatical leave, the cost of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious the agreements reached with the November, February and May with the BMA are.
A two-pound daily drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attacks patients are benefiting from a two-pound daily liver medicine after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans for longer.
Anti-clotting drug, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or second seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of them have a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter accumulated in the wall of the artery, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks, it can travel with the blood and break the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making the coagulation less likely.
The draft guidelines for NICE published today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Review Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative effect on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we recommend a tentative ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand potentially benefiting people.
Because the information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - in particular as regards the risk of bleeding - over three-year periods is limited, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread votermal fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles berated the police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of “racial and religious hypersensitivity.”
The former Community Secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed the possibility of setting patrol chains outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present identification when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that an indestructible ink be placed on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He is calling for more extensive access to the council documents and decisions made by informal committees or the working group.
“This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud,” he said.
The government commissioned a report following a voting scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have “led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting, appearing another.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern about the election fraud in the post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for the purification of the voting system, including proof of identity with an ID
He said in a report: “Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“Concerns were raised that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ over-sensitive nature of race and religion.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for the system to be cleaned up. These included the ban on political activists to be allowed to process the ballot papers received by mail in order to ‘sound-take’.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for stricter amendments to registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the indestructible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail-in voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made voices and envelopes through the mail, where the votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Insist that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff sticks to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric beats the Greater London Police Force, saying it’s “amazing” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court recused Lutfur Rahman and his clerk as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities,” he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without suspicion, according to the criminal law test threshold.
He also criticized the ineffective “check-in checks” in the City Council’s voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, “Last year’s Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy of giving birth to parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation.”
Crazy about Kate's cyclist twin flight and other famous photos of celebrities at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone haywire with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer and can brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio ever since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos surfaced, where he looks frighteningly similar to The Wolf of Wall Street's star.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the zeal of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard from Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a big resemblance, except maybe for the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 is sure to emerge this year as well: a startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's large, expressive eyes are said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A bigger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the “sporty version” of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more in common with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team reminds fans of “Joseph Gordon Levitt’s sporting version.”
Hardwomen: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
One Twitter user recently expressed their happiness on the site that “others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the U.S. football star and the actress of Dexter really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to actress Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer was “dead like a pig”
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place relay of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay infuriated viewers of the CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been due to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer had “lost like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig.”
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought her microphone was turned off when she began sharing some of her own opinions in the women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring “color,” was heard saying, “That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch up with China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Did the CBC commentator just say that China’s 14-year-old swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot didn’t realize he was still on the live broadcast.”
China’s Ai Yanhan was described in the women’s freestyle 4 x 200 metres relay final: “That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.”
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #disgusting.”
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized on the live broadcast for MacDonald’s comment, saying, “We’re sorry that the comment about the swim performance was sent to the broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we regret that this happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, a commentator, had to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize in this moment for the comment I made last night after the women’s message,” she said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
“I referred to the swimmer’s performance, not him as a person.”
“It’s probably unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who brazenly fitted underwear in the middle of a store
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try on her underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what he looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to wander around and eventually fitted four pairs of underpants in a shop located in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman fitted underwear and then put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was in the store at the same time, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed up again and walked away from the store without buying anything.”
He said, “People didn’t believe their eyes.”
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took the pair's underwear, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on the fittings.
“He didn’t even try to find a remote place for fitting, he just stood there shameless.”
“Everyone was staring when he again took off his underwear and clearly didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.”
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, got dressed again and walked out.
“He didn’t seem to care who was watching — or thinking of someone who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is taking home the underwear someone else has tried but not cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after the woman left the sale, which is fine.”
“It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they haven’t been washed.”
A representative of Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All such products have been withdrawn from sale.’
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with the robbers waving the gun in close proximity.
Whether you're approaching the front or the back, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker the same length.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn to see your attacker and “clear the line of fire.”
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you punch the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by striking the knee in the groin, and when the attacker goes out of pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him in the back of the gun, and then retreat, and then hold the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the fire line, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot trigger.
Put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point a gun at him.
Does that sound tricky?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a host and travel writer from Suffolk, licked the euro banknote, the handrail at Piccadilly Circus, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flushing button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, no of his licks left him with anything else in the mouth of bad taste.
Wright became a well-known tester of endurance of his gut as he traveled the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from public railway station railings to the flush button of the toilet seat, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since I was a child, I’ve been pretty carefree about my health, and I’ve put all sorts of things in my mouth, starting with the soil, worms, and muddy water.”
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, the reading of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in one of the Russian public toilets, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler on the trail of film, Internal Power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, “This is almost the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because there's a lot to do here.
On the trail of internal power, we produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost the intestinal bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and which at the same time would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and ended up with the idea of ‘let’s call Ian’.”
They argue that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell our everyday environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film, we can interestingly tell more about it to consumers.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The director of the documentary, Tom Hakala, added: “Let’s just say it: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the things to be licked were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we were able to record some of those dirty licks.”
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they sometimes use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The bully family destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The bully family caused the damage to their rental house 50 000 pounds after being evicted due to the terroristization of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after several complaints were made.
After being removed from the property by force, the shocked housing company's officials found the property to be in poor condition.
There were gaping openings in the walls, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, a manager at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property could not be repaired.
He said, “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here, because this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is disreputable, and their name is disreputable.”
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and according to the police, the family's despots included a street fight with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, was decided in June on anti-social behavior.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat of demolition found old waste.
The floorboards of the property from which drugs have been previously transmitted had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing used force to evict a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been a bad situation.
We've seen the police here a lot of times.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It’s a shame that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate everything my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the courageous community members who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that anti-social behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that the three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the waste stacks surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of dividing it.
He claimed the money was for the tombstone of his son, Lee Skeldon. He died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless now in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the rooms in the house had graffiti scribbled.
Police say they are trying to evict the residents, who are making fun of the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to make fun of the rules.
“This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, and for those who suffer such behavior,” he said.
The police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew the shore sluggishly low
Sun-worshipper tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, were shocked by their lives
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft swept past from a very low level
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
At this very moment, the horrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows a military aircraft coming almost to the touch of a sun worshipper in the northern Portugal's Aveiro.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not initially see what was coming from behind the clouds towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic passing on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, “It passed twice at a really low level, and at one point it looked like it was crashing to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was about to fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight aimed at identifying fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of the mainland Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the conditions that had affected visibility, the smoke caused by wildfires and the thick fog
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote's first half-year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better result of 3.4 million euros in January to June.
Eksote's result was 4.3 million euros in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the sequences of measures.
Eksote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess part of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border jaegers swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military ceremony for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special border jaeger course was held on the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was sworn in by 70 conscripts.
Special border jaegers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become Special Border Jaegers.
250 were invited to the entrance examinations.
Special border jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting, which was held in connection with the oath-event, was attended by five wartime border guard veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had a RTA, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is led by a sergeant in Lahti.
The Chief Executive is Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a plaintiff.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the rest of the police.
In Häme, among other things, it has acquired information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of the analysis units is the latest reform of the police's working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave the whistles in the place of the swirls only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of the information collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, manages operations nationwide.
As the name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTAs, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The inquiry extends beyond your area
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is the RTA unit's job to know what's happening in the entire police department.
The inquiry also extends beyond the boundaries of your own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of working.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method, the author becomes a certain image.
Serving can be done either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information about.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
Both their own methods and the methods used by criminals are not disclosed, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent attempts to fight crime against the police.
The police will publicly report the methods if it anticipates that they would pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, a news released in early summer, the method of marking empty apartments used in residential burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment, with which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material is public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The most clever order the district court's minutes, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time we'll go stealing with gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the National Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
A reduction in the number of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of its own institution and Finland.
ISIS schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumoured to have been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard this died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just while planning an escape from a war-torn country and her return to Britain.
“One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will to others, that there are real risks involved in entering the war zone – that it could make people give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland a Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose a person to replace the late Supreme Court member, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicted with “some certainty” that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether to appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not “rock the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are the "henchmen" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is “for women as well as for men”
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, the president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine, rich in nude photos, is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
“We need to start showing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these naked images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release, where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill in the comment section with irritable insults, the author of which is a pseudonym NonAllSoliteMile-agedMen, please note that this claim is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed new arrival of the albums is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for middle-age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the most unlikely of all, the albums are bought by 18-24-year-olds.
It's not just about collecting amateurs, it's about emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to have their emotions (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk through the busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I would be vigorously suggesting before I would stop, form a cup out of my hands and say something authoritative, such as, “Let’s take a closer look at it.”
Let's look into it further.
At the same time, as Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supply stores, now fill buildings with independent shops in the past - a handful of stunning specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment, as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temper.
Glasgow-based Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Raysta (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
“I guess I am,” he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 records.
These plates, which are shown in the picture above (he sent the sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
“Most of the material I bought is from the late 60’s and early 70’s, albums released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get,” he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my vice."
Wez, a 25-year-old who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she encounters fit into YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the enthusiasm of the media. People who have heard that the albums have come into fashion again and who have the need to buy back their old albums.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have gotten rid of their collection in general in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records,” he said.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakeners of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
A store like Phonica takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar record covers; objects that evoke the memories of the happy days of teenage years.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort in owning objects,” Wez said.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
“We’re like their social workers!” another employee said suddenly from the record stack.
An April poll conducted by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers don't have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned when browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This ‘reward’ aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works in Sounds of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big part, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fopp, which today has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the stores mentioned earlier - the loudspeakers are the latest synth and sex-filled pop by Wild Beast, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, looking at the various records for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collecting isn't really an option.
“It’s expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she sighs in love.
“I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.”
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to make it look like I'm researching denim shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before Dad and Dause think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with albums by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential albums of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely ‘art vinyl’.
But given that even the slightest attention these items may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho to get more, there is not much to complain about here.
It should come as no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street's record stores, scrolling through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter, as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the sharks, says that the record is for a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long.
French court rejects application to cancel deals in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent taxes on the unpaid parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals served by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille decreed that there were no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 temporary shops, but said that the concern of the prefect of Calais was “utterly understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extreme uncertain conditions.”
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals daily, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said the closure of the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, the Help Refugees and the L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to the top of the 9000 people – to the top – after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food in Finland will fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food is sharply reduced in Finland to the delight of consumers and the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while on average in the EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen the second most in those EU countries with the same wage level as Finland.
Of the comparison countries, only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data can be found in Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen's article, which was published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010's, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came the turn, after which food has become cheaper every year.
Now the price is weighed down by the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Intensified price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven of affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in the EU countries, which had a similar wage level to Finland's.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the reference countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same wage level.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the reference countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve the VAT to the EU average and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes at the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same
Returning to school may notice that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official goals.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, schools start practicing coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin to be read already at four.
The biggest change concerns the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known for its icebreaker, reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live on for another 250 years, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is overtaken only by an Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is timed to be 507 years old.
Greenland's sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the monitorings, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The sample's two largest fish, the 493 and 502-centimetre Amazonian fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
As previous studies have found that ice-branches only reach sexual maturity over four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 - sellers will not be deducted
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The partner companies in the company, which was in trouble, ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores is not reduced so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, about 80 support function employees are offered new work as a salesperson.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the start of the reduction, the reduction need was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The aim of the reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately 20 million euros, which are due to be realised during the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of 50 million euros this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in obtaining profitable from the department store trade.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter, the department store transaction is still making a loss.
According to Stockmann's acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sale in department stores has not reached the company's targets.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says in a statement.
The second-quarter earnings improvement was mainly due to the success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter revenue and earnings.
Lindex's operating profit increased by 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
In the corresponding period last year, the entire operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on top of the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be showers in the central parts of the country, but further south it will be pouty.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as throughout the country the mercury is below 20 degrees.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees is left.
Kenya's athletics team is rocked by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah appeared as the national team's athlete in a doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete in which Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because she "blew her crime against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," Kenya Olympic Committee President Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner will be aware of any consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Championships last year and is a favourite to win Rio in the preliminary round.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was on the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officers confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's athletics stadium is empty
Where is everyone?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, following athletics.
Rio started a battle on Friday for athletics medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show their skills to a confusingly empty stand.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening races have been sold.
Four years ago, there was a second in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, kayaking and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12 000-person stands were only filled with about 30 percent.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organizers, said at the weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million to be sold," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to the opening of the opening to more than 1,00 euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have issued 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on the sand of the Copacaba hasn't interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can use the money to claim holders' rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who are willing to acquire a holder right for a fee.
The holder shall be granted a veto for his 187-square-metre block, which means in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the intended use of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Obtaining the right of possession is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don't have to go and carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control for his company.
The person who has acquired the right of possession receives accurate location information from their block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website contains the name information of those who have acquired the holder rights on the same map where the parcel information on the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees the only risk of its nature conservation procurement being that the foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect the natural areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holders, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and is planning a land acquisition from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in a pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst-hungry city in Turku - see the situation in your home municipality
Bicycle thieves are the worst-placed in Finland's major cities.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the number of inhabitants than in the other nine major cities.
On the basis of the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and parts of bicycles and parts per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police records, four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants occurred.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, right?
"In some cities, double the number of thefts take place relative to the number of inhabitants," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the National Police Board.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of theft can be influenced by how much people move around the city on bikes and how many bikes there are in the first place," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense center, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, the number of bicycle thefts in the whole of Finland in January-August has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period last year.
However, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline of recent years, the police are aware of just over 20 000 bike thefts every year.
That's 50-60 bikes every day and about 4 000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report the bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be found out.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in the blood.
"Cases can also be found in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug case in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from shopping centre bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, online.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that stolen bikes would go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or offence.
"The alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," says Reen.
Specialist library clerk Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of his workday.
He has had five bikes, but not one has been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never taken, has a good monk been there."
"Perhaps this isn't so much attractive to thieves, this doesn't necessarily have any hipster value," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who had been visiting a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike was sitting against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bikes on some fixed, such as a bike rack.
"I think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You can always hear from your friends that the bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such sleazy-Jopas."
A bicycle was stolen from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
The bike hadn't been locked, though, so Valve was waiting to take it.
Under 15-year-olds responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tested to prevent young people from falling into a criminal spiral.
Initially, the experiment applies to people under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury intervenes in the first young person's crime.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator of the crime and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime may join the Peer Jury himself in order to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Director of Youth Services Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation patterns that are used in parallel.
"Everyone steers the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything does not go away from the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young person will not be faced with an adult panel after their first crime, but will reflect on what happened with approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at the Palmu service design agency that followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first offences of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you keep going on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is directed to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking unpopularity, threaten to bring the Democrats a slur in these elections," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections could prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the undersigned are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes "from people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not to support anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the U.S. economy would do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive, US$275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a handout to American workers who suffer when factories move to countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder people, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to ease the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax exile, it has to pay the tax on departure, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As President, I'm against any trade deals that work against employees or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton planned to criticize the economic program that Republican Donald Trump announced on Monday that it "only favors this kind of millionaires."
Clinton has previously called Trump a loophole.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized herself as the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
Such are the ratings of Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in the TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At a time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: Tuesday night's swimming was watched by 615 000 viewers on Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago received almost 800 000 spectators at TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships received well over a million.
The most interesting Olympics so far are Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
The head of Yle sports, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that the spectators are divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics at Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the percentage of TV viewers who choose the Olympics in general.
On the TV side, too, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20 000 to 500 000 spectators throughout that time, it's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the lame interest - if someone now considers it lame - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early competitions, the interest would have popped upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When the athletics begins, the ratings explode.
For the Games, Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store on the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I bet we're already going around 200 000 downloads.
"We won't get the online ratings until later," Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be shown on Yle's channels and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the competitions every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last, which can only be followed on Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be broadcast on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to the official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre depression in Ristiselkä, the depth of which was 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred meters, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Lake Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown deeps," Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14:29: Corrected the last paragraph with the deepest lakes of the average depth wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax cut: Taxation of pensioners still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still higher than that of wage and salary earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came up in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage and salary earners.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income deductions that reduced taxation.
The matter heated up in Parliament the opposition representatives, who were grilling the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (National Coalition Party) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) is mainly about securing and increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (Centre Party) and Orpo's messages on the desire to honour the hard-hited Competitiveness Pact.
He says that sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It is done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be challenged by questioning.
It will be needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
Infection with prolonged unemployment in the threshing
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were about 17 000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to go to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach especially Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The ambassador speculates that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thai society and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The bill was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested who claimed responsibility for the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict linked to the Muslim population is smouldering, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist attractions.
Bangkok is having a big, local holiday today, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police.
At least four people have died in Thailand in a day, while 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including in tourist-favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in Phuket, a tourist destination popular with Finns, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require any deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, in the southern Thai village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in each.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta that ruled Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks took place in tourist attractions.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns who intend to go to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the guidelines of the Embassy for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Invulned Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
More than 20 others were killed and more than 20 foreign tourists were wounded.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the second attack in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as a sight.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
The Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee was killed.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded every half hour or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
Biles won the women's four-game match
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with a score of 60,098 and Russia's Aliya Mustafina third with a 58.665-point lead.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for scaffolding championships on the floor, jump and boom at the Rio Games.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnastics in recent years.
He had eight world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and floor championships three times in a row and a boom last year and the other year.
The U.S. team has won two world championships in the team competition.
The Biles have dimmer World Championship medals on the jump and the boom.
Thai entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club located in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think there will be any miracles, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has witnessed many of the tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If the previous ones haven't deported tourists, then hardly this either.
The Huovila company's office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around nine o'clock local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
Not many people on the beach had even heard of the attacks.
At half past three in the day, traffic in Patong had normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the strike site.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men suitable for the description, hiding in a nearby spruce tree.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other one escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage of a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russian Leader Changes: Clear Relocation
Russia made the most senior leader change in the years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his regime, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in squabbles with other executives or screwed up.
Dealing position in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will transfer to special environmental and transport affairs.
With a tape presented by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his immediate circle to be younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 19:30: Earlier, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document publication policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to the Interior Minister's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Communications Director says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time in the run-up to the championships.
He injured his hamstring early in the season and had to miss the Jamaica Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been a complete preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included under-the-top samba dancers and journalists who had become fans.
Porina Bolt's surroundings underline the fact that the Jamaican's star has risen in the era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter first round with a time of 21.05.
At the time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a 100-meter-long period, which he used to break the world record and the self-confidence of his rivals in the time he was born with a time of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached his career on the clock.
The world records set in Berlin with 9.58 100 metres and 19.19 for two hundred are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second undercut, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
At Satanen, Bolt's biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of Athens' 2004 100th Olympics.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals of the title race, if only he has made it.
In Daegu, the 2011 World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to a cheating start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the youth men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm a parent and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping violation
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 metres butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has referred its doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also been reported in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent Rios to the home of an athletics coach for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historic gold came in the style of a show
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in the 200 metres mixed scenes his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic gold medal of the same sport in the fourth consecutive competition.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed standings ahead of Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on this week's Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise on social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a shortish dress that is sure to have at least enough revealance - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, no rear-end steps are expected.
It's important to look good, and after all, small controversies are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be thrilled and perhaps startled, but he emphasizes that he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This isn’t about me, he said.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached the point of Finland?
I can't, but everything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers do the work and how big the sacrifices they make is ok for me," Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a controversy about nothing if it comes from (the presenter's) dress.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two counts of terror
Rio police said Thursday that it had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the Games.
Police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All the suspects were Brazilians.

The detainees are believed to have links to the Islamic State extremist group.
The detainees had reportedly incited violence on social media.
Messages urging violence had been distributed, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.

Argentine lady pushed Petäjä-Siren - Finn pondered protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren was hit hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday in the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away," Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered a protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn finished at number 27 with the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The crash did not affect the tip very much.
Friday is an important day when you have to race 10-12.
Modified at 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that their life lengthens.
Sometimes, on the other hand, things that the person themselves cannot influence can bring him additional years.
These include the tendency to abdominal obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to splurge - just picking up a milk carton is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented the seven strangest findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol is supported by studies that say that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway examined how laughing affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years in his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings additional years, it is not disputed.
However, achieving a long life does not require absolute sleight of hand.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who won a medal at the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, he's more likely to live further than a regular chubby.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behavior of people over 65 found that a person shopping every day, probably living a parent who is rarely shopping.
This is because running in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring forward death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver derailed in a truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Koski, Southwest Finland.
The accident happened in Koski, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the newly arrived passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
A passenger car plunged into a ditch and from then over a ditch on its roof.
A woman who was driving a passenger car in 1972 was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breathalyzer test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket's selection of loose candy because Posti had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salo's K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught my eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So, if it's not traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The foxing sign of the merchant is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include mowing the lawn.
The lawn mowing is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia managed to grab her own favourites in a loose candy bag, even though a few lars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the transport services business of Posti's companies, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we didn't go to work on the partial delivery (Salo) for three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant at the sign, because she found all her own favourites of loose candy in the selection.

You're amazing, though.
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard! one praises.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I'm on the same journey," the other says.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last few pounds with the Let's do it now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was ten kilos away.
During the three-month course, five kilograms eventually fell.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation to the police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Clinic has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and also completed his nurse training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where the donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was desparently wounded in the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise a temporary agency worker, the District Court of Kanta-Häme estimates in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the detained wages and 2 000 euros in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the induction worker's salary, which corresponded to the part of the induction throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his or her trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the Postal and Logistics Union's decision on the prohibition of induction.
During last year's November postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees would not familiarise temporary agency workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Ps.) in their reply to the Union of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in a letter, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns in favour of freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression for Turkey.
Putin dismissed the head of his regime - replaced by the Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
The replacement will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close-knit insider of Putin, will move to special environmental and transport affairs tasks, according to the Kremlin.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became the president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election.
ManU's ban on Premier League opening
The world record holder for football moves will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed England.
Manchester United's acquisition, Paul Pogba, is suspended for the opening season of ManU's season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros to Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) will keep him out of the game, as Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup and will be banned for one match.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next chance of playing will be in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomanship is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's status as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with their distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival, which will be held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The reason for the success is a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves like to go to?
It's quite unusual in event productions to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to last year's 70 000 people by 5 000.
This year, the festival will feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities need to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is directed in huge averages.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated so that the area, partly decorated with artificial turf, has 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, the venue this year is a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even large visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the middle of the 2000s, the operations were very dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of approximately 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can be used to create "crazy things" like building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own distinctive clothing.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the trendy community of young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with the content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of punk, the 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival, which combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked, because now is probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and she's been doing some damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs of the tourist paradise of Thailand were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up with the help of cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wildlife who has lived in Asia, tweeted a very telling picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran to me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets," Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on the popular Phuket island of Phuket.
No one is reported to have died.
Meanwhile, a second double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that it had not yet exploded.
According to Thai authorities, the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby troops will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to fight missions several months after the military oath is sworn, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who was interviewed by the newspaper, for example, conscripts serving for 5.5 months in a war situation are only able to fight in the final stages of their training.
According to the head of education, the reservists belonging to the standby force are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to have a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it turned out that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts to the units of immediate readiness from next year.
If necessary, the units can be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensation for the mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been 330 000 euros.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth that is dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to 132 000 euros, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as 198 000 euros.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma 150 000 euros in the price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs totalling 47 344 euros.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already been aware of the need for repairs to the apartment when the sale of the apartment was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction defects that occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to start repair work.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition inspection report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and shortcomings of the ventilation and the fact that the management of rainwater and meltwater flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not turn out that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the impression that the rainwater coming from the cliffs should be controlled a little bit within a few years.
The transaction was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both rock rainwater and capillarily rising soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, according to the inspector's assessment, the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mold or yeast that enables the health risk, exceeds the limit values were found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision, before the transaction, according to which changes to the apartment had been made that were contrary to the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were central to the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for extensive repair work in the near future.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finnish in the register
In a recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about how documents have been recorded on microfilms in Maryland, USA, for a total of 218 500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to be the Nazi brides.
The documents and license plates come from the Racial Bureau of Nazi Germany.
The Finnish Breeding Authority was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were subjected to gynecological examinations to investigate the matter.
The Finnish Breeding Authority investigated the women's backgrounds, for example, by examining church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Racial Bureau wanted guarantees that the women were "child-loving", "sparing", and "good National Socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive's documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside of the marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum's website says.
Instead, Nazis' demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for having children.
The German mother's honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolls Day in the Rio Olympics, but was the tail peak of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko finished eighth in the overall standings after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to number 14.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for 17 and three in the RS:X class day.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening run of the day.
The Lindgrens are ranked 19 overall.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hangovered"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finns' favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of the year in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dance halls and festivals, Sillanpää is still on the rise and he is currently on the rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen and about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both for good and for bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total climb when he won the Tango King's crown at the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the competition, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go quite as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape with a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in a hangover!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess that it was sung on a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfect and top-notch all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, which is described in the book, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced his then partner, and the case ended up in the lyrics of the song You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the song lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the lyrics of the song about the breakup were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 Days magazine.
In the newspaper's news, the reason for Jari's and ex-loved divorce was told that Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption was told, but according to Jari, it was complete nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, Jari played the song in a furious manner and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 % of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48 % would have remained in the Union, even though the polls of the week predict the opposite result.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university advocated for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into the scrapheap in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue in politics.
Economical curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of the economic status of economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still imagine that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the real Brit.
Many also have the impression that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economists' Union, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists did not come up enough.
They were particularly concerned by the fairness of the BBC, which gave the same amount of space to only a couple of per cent of the economists' population, which advocates an EU exit from the EU as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hate-minded press was not interested in explaining what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic letter combinations of the consequences of the separation are.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and the currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, then they were not cared for, because economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think have common interests.
Academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also economic
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a Briton to get doctor's appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a school place if they could get rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues of health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors of the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. a camp in favour of leaving the EU, was prepared for more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to increase our cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open real estate fund quoted on a daily basis, which was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion pounds at the time.
In total, the company's funds are worth about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds of the UK's real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten per cent or even below that.
In other words, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp, which advocated the EU exit, won, Europe went haywire.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
And then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freezed its trading.
These, together, swung the situation and put the matter in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good due to the cash collected, but it, too, had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the commerce, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it was now worthwhile to pull the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the notification.
Since then, the market has been quite even, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the Aberdeen Continental Europe Funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the closures dominated by about four percent of Britain's real estate.
The Aberdeen lockdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than 10 properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might be sticking to its fund for 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ragged downwards, but the situation does not look "faderous" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and the dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and the market also has a 15% sale in relation to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit has brought down the minus to the London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't look like much.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of the real estate investments of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power word got in there.
I realized that this is now going to the side of plan B, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already completely alive in the morning.
At the office, the normally silent TV screens were full of news, and the normally loud crowd was completely silenced to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared for the option well, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went on an exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK and London in particular.
Up to 20% of the office space in London was anticipated in the coming years.
Soon, a group of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays this week in Helsinki.
He still thinks it's too early to say much about what Brexit will be.
So much is still open: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first known.
CBRE's information on price development covers approximately one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London's office buildings accounted for 6.1 per cent of the negatives, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large drops hit the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was quickly compared to Lehman's downfall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
According to Vanhanen, the comparison is not quite accurate, as this is a home-made crisis in the UK.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that, but rather the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
The repair could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the price correction movement is no wonder for him - such a thing could have been ahead even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world's number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that City and especially offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The fall started very high.
London's prices have been upwards for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership category that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has led, for example, pension companies to look for income from new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used clearly less than in the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, disperse
In London, the rise in prices stabilized last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and last year was a net seller.
There was some kind of turnaround to be expected, and now it's here.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much for the future, but says that there is hardly any climbing spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several stores up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that we can get through the bumps with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If you have diversified, the risks are also diversified, Vanhanen says.
S Group will start registering purchase information in more detail than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information on the purchases of its regular customers.
As information has been collected so far on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it from purchased products in early May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
According to grocery shopping alone, Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is currently planned.
Suomen Lähikaupa has its own First Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwa and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product group data, we will stick to the level of the receipt total.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of K Group or S Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First, the experiment
SOK's co-op member and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic data have also included occupation, education, the form of housing, the birth years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their role are also registered.
The S-Etukortti card purchase is saved the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their POS systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be saved in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terros and ABC chains have the information recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have expressed the hope that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK's Co-op member and partner operations manager.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored at the checkouts anyway, whether you like it or not.
The willing person can check their deposited data on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - the puppy will be the first explosives dog
The black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes set in a row at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of sniffing casings smelling of gunpowder gas were revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online shopping access
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives, and it will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, the tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action at Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs' duties is postal items passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport every year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made an online store of about 300 discoveries related to purchases, luggage and air cargo of passenger aircraft, weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their precursors.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In the future, it will be of great benefit to ports, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila also go to the police and the Defence Forces' experts to train.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and the flow of people.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from a single time.
Ilta-Sanomat's cameraman loses the camera's microphone cover to the fast dog, but Heila immediately returns the cover that looks like a soft toy from the "out" command.
A tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen in work tasks at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet the dog wearing a work vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work shares last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition for the owner of working dogs at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied for the ownership of Heila.
Onni hit Suntio, who has not had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
The mini-state received its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Fiji Olympic gold medal in rugby, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team's homecoming.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, we watched the game, I heard them cheer," Maikele Seru, a reporter for the Fiji Times, told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded on his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifting.
During or immediately after the hard lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one really knew why.
Tokola received 175 kilograms of push in Rio and 145 kilograms from the rapture.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push by 175 kilos, as well as one another.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a wild roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian striker Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed Estonian striker Albert Prosa to the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 player agents.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out from the crowd as a good option, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goalkeeper Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The voluptuous Modern Family star shrugs again: the teen star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a kind comedy-made Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family, once again blasts by showing off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed for very few clothes in the photos she posted on social media and got numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, who is on the eve of adulthood, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it out here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has radically changed her image.
At the time, PowerwomenTV's founder and CEO, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adulthood.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look at the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge not to ignore the criticism.
You look amazing!
I don't care what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, says the young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In the autumn, it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn, says Visit Finland in a press release.
The main destinations of the Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts from the early autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the Northern Lights, making the sight double the fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and here, according to Lind, the Northern Lights have huge potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is content with rugby silver, with a masterclass organized by Fid leading to gold
The British's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed into Fiji's final challenge in Thursday night's final, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a masterclass in handling, chewing, dodging, support game, running lines and sheer power when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable consolation for the silver medal - the third of the British Day - and they were allowed to be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby kick-off tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong 7-5 victory in the semi-final from South Africa on the same day may have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top-performing team of 15 people in this condition.
The fact that at least one Briton has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow is to say that Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to the UK has been quite something.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here, they only lost one.
This spanking hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started out excellently, combating the UK's tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running on moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner into the finish area.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right wing led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but that was just a slowdown for Fid.
With seven minutes left, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and the UK was 17-0 with a loss.
Nakarawa scored again from a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute...the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the loose tackles of the UK and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the score was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's actually the case.
The UK made some changes during the break, blocking the Fidi dam... for a whole four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive assist.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK when he scored in the left corner of the touchdown and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fidi's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute goal was frosting on Fidi's cake, which didn't need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Great Britain defeated South Africa in a tight semi-final, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling leg job and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured the victory and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the battle for cancer
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 tough squeals towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, the boat had three votes. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the duo swung their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in a women's pairs competition - the first women in the British sports history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with the grace of the swan, not fully reflecting the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, it was a close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It's a little change in your mindset.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that phrase can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first of the couple's thoughts was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, the Afghan command-in-chief of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: “I’ve been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been great.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he deserves a big thank you, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their competitors could not reach.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in the moment.
Helen shouted “stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start and didn't try to do anything special at the same time.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good rowing and winning the race, and that's what we did.
The couple is looking forward to a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to replace Panama-leaved government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were already called for by the protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day is now scheduled for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the election result in the autumn.
In the June presidential election, the criticism of those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest remarks.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be involved in the establishment of the organization by the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink that low,” Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a Muslim-favorite burkini swimsuit on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good practice and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which grandly express religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disturbances in order in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's national day.
At the end of July, two men linked to the Islamic State attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - in Pyykösjärvi, blue-green algae ease
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae spas have been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters in the bathing waters were below the thresholds laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal concentrations in the water of the Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae sludge observed at the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswitchable, but in favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae flowering, which forms blue-green algae mass on the water surface as ferries.
The environmental measure monitors the situation by frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae sprouts turn into blue-green algae flowering, the matter will also be announced separately on the beach notice board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen on the forest gift deduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of a forest estate.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal on the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of creating such a tool to promote the generational changes of forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Confederation of Finnish Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticise in the tax amendment proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner's clean capital income.
It is capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the proceeds from the sale of the wood.
The Ministry's proposal starts with making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry prevents the loss of capital income from forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get the tax benefit even if they did not sell the tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit for the tax deduction tied to the forest's yield value is 40 000 euros in the proposal.
According to Hakkarainen, it has been pulled too high.
According to him, it will eliminate 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of the forest owner base, he says.
The Ministry of Finance considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the forest gift reduction has been carried out in forest policy for decades.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner community.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists in Himanka - two cars plunged into a ditch and collided with each other
A special rear-end collision occurred in Himanka, Kalajoki, on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars that drove in a row plunged into a ditch, after which the person behind him collided with the rear of the driver.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyyhtiä, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail shower.
There were two people in the car behind him, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car in the forecast was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of drug therapies for cancer may be improved by focusing not only on cancer cells, but also on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue.
The results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
The murder of Muhos' family home continues in the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder conviction for another perpetrator
The threshing of the family home murder in Muhos continues in the court for both of those convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family home in Muhos.
The second received 8 years of 4 months of manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle without the right as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the more severe sentence.
The prosecutor is seeking the sentence of a lesser man for murder as a young person to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a counsellor for the school home's child welfare unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked a director from behind on the living room sofa.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also choked with a wire, punched and kicked in the head.
According to the mental health study, both of those convicted were in full understanding at the time.
According to the court, the young people had planned an escape from the family home, at least from the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, only multiplying at the age of 156
The world's longest-lived vertebral spine has been confirmed to be the ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swimming around Greenland, the holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not multiply until she is 156 years old.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only a centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years - although the throw in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world.
Up to a third of the state's total tax revenue would not be received if Donald Trump's push for a corporate tax change is implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with the tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I would miss a huge amount, 1 000 billion dollars a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the government of over-regulation of business and the bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided by the hasty must be reinstated and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and from Mexico a penalty tax of 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to monitor the seas, American steel to lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike in his manner, Trump faithfully read a speech written by aides, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see the Trump program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday.
A tsunami from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is fatally turbulent, but the actual tsunami is hitting the middle of the Madrid street hustle and bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
That's the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a sleek and rough satirical comedy, the preceding Skin I Live in (2011) the pinnacle of the Spanish master's career.
Levelly, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene drama of love, relationship and family, with a mother-daughter relationship at the center.
The story is simple and is largely seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on the main pattern for a middle-aged name (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life for her adult daughter.
He begins the time before the birth of his daughter, the moment when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will take on the second female lead in the series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a sluggish one, but I would say that quite slyly and literally with a one-time swipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance to the so characteristic flash of humour.
It is an equally acted-out, restrained, place-in-place with good music and quite sad film, in which it is an element of elegy.
On the other hand, the Spanish director's characteristic visual saturation is still there and in such a way that it gradually begins to catch the eye more as a pure formality than as a functional dramatic power tool.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally fine.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point, i.e. the tweaks of the current scene, do not improve particularly.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, the result is a somewhat evenly thick literary literature film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably more robust drama, so many big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie is about.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres at 12.8.
Government tries to vote - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns Party will not completely collapse.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made in abundance.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) assure in the run-up to the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there will be no new cuts in the Ministry's proposal, because the decision on social security cuts was already made in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Educational cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunted
Why do ministers stress so much that no new cuts will be made on top of them?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the polls indicate that the Finns Party expects a defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, a large number of whom will realize the price of influencing in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three approximately equal parties depends on the Finns Party's eduction.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party's voters had enough of government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the rhetoric of the new cuts will obscure the fact that next year they will be made drastically and, secondly, try to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if Sipilä's board is still standing.
The Government has set itself the goal of receasing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take on 5.9 billion euros next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government cannot follow its own programme: debt does not bend or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means, on top of the past, new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, what will happen in the parliamentary elections will be received.
With these measures, the debt is not good
It is quite clear that with the current measures, the indebtedness will not be broken, although Juha Sipilä is trying to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the information session on the budget prove it irrefutably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, meaning that there will be no traction from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has not risen much since the collapse of 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and prolonged by an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt stimulus presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will practically be covered by taking on a completely new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for Municipal Development.
A clear majority of the population also assumes responsibility for libraries, culture, community colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management for the individual municipality.
The county, in turn, is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
None of the tasks under municipal public order are to be transferred to the state.
An underage drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu was running away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie in Joensuu on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle that had been driving without lights, but a young man left to drive the police away from a fair amount of speeding.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where further to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed police officer ran to the fugitive.
The blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that would have justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as aggravated endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a stone fell into a ditch
A truck with a stone load fell into a ditch on Kaavintie in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted to the left in a bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through the door above the leftover door, together with the rescue helicopter's personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the owner of the vehicle to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil spilled on the road from the fallen truck, which was absorbed by the rescue department into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in Ilmajoki this afternoon
The 87-year-old woman has been missing in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, in South Ostrobothnia, since the afternoon.
Police are looking for a woman with about 165 centimetres long, slender and good posture with white hair under her chin.
Observations and clues about the lost person's movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre's hotline on 0295440513.
Ingredients for a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the Parafest disaster
The downpour that crashed the tents of the Parafest festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, the president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances on the premises of the City Theatre starting at 13 o'clock.
The Ahjo Art Centre has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The downward flow occurs in the thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a declining airflow.
Changes in the state of water in the thunderstorm cloud bind heat, and thus the declining air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, several downstream currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The path of downward flows is difficult to predict.
The downward trend struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5pm.
Three tents were knocked down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
A slight infringement of four people in the accident injured themselves.
There was one child who was transported to further treatment with a slight injury.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for the aging of the skin is air pollution.
British research is reported by the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analysed the most toxic fine particles in the air in London and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, for example, a peer living in the countryside.
Skin-aging fine particles are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those in London who commute on foot near crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but a more practical solution is recommended to cleanse the skin regularly.
The brakes of the tractor failed - pushed the man in front of him
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not run any further, as it collided with the rocks in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, will leave for the series starting in October from a better starting point than the men's memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common ground is more certain than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Riento's head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and unified.
Fred Musoni, the centre-back of the foreign trio, will start his second season in Rienno.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-centimetre chipper.
Garchet is correspondingly a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 188 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipojat to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the World Floorball Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in its sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was the founder of the national team.
I got interested and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the kind of sport was not yet played at the Finnish Championship level except floorball.
The floorball was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipojat ice hockey in the Finnish Championship, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played in the Finnish Floorball Championship series in 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
While playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
The women's Finnish Championship career culminated in the silver medal in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's Finnish Championship for 10 seasons, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The last Finnish Championship season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josba was brought up by Joensuu-based floorball club Jostu Puska and the eno-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Brno EFT tournament in the Czech Republic on 6–8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking in a Helsinki-based Set, has played six men's national matches before that, where he has a total of 9+4=13 points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh problem and is a member of the national team's standard equipment with the experience of 117 international matches.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of the Seinäjoki Peliveljets, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December's World Championships.
Petri Kettunen, the head coach of the national floorball team, is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball master Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to retire as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Championships of Beach volleyball will be decided on the weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
During the three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation, the top six pairs in each category will be accepted for the Finnish Volleyball Players' Championship tournament organized by Kouvolan Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Association.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäki YMCA, who has been one of the Finnish beach volleyballs for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the stands this weekend.
There must be a great arena for the basement stadium.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark for sports and gave a good start to a great hobby.
I have very good memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki's YMCA's E-girls.
The top of my mind is a jersey that is too big, the knee pads on my ankles, and amazing ace screams and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved in the activities - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was a natural choice for indoor volleyball already in junior time.
The beach of Käyrälampi has been played since the 1990's.
Visitors have always been active.
I also went to the junior Finnish Championships to see for myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the Finnish Championship finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
The realistic goal is a medal.
We're still missing the gold medal from the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in civilian work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
In any case, the flip-flops are put on at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The downward trend knocked down tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The downstream flow knocked out three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, the tents had a total of about 200 people.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 17.
Fire Chief Markus Viitaniemi, who was interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli bravely became a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigour.
The young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started to continue their operations as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always liked to be on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a barn in the yard, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was very brave enough to join the project and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of the magazine Maaseudun Futures.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (Augus 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the following consumer goods price was seen to increase: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat’s “anime” effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, face-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All the missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app advertises a blackface mask or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens to some users this week that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a “yellow face” or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies could be a sign of the company's bigger problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that “it’s hard to argue against a comparison with aggravated Asian caricature and filter effects next to each other.”
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degrading.
Snapchat isn't the only company that goes beyond these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of more racially diverse young people can mean they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an insulting image of the user, “it’s much more difficult for these guys to be discreet.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a phone interview, he said he believed race-related disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company's main white male leadership and concluded his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
“Either they have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions,” said Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented populations and take forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said, keeping their Snapchat account closed, adding: “Do you think they actually need more users like us to say that this isn’t okay.”
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, a congressional panel said that the U.S. military military headquarters had shaped intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of the task force set up by the House Defense Forces Committee's Republican Chairman, Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriation Sub-Committee found “extensive dissatisfaction" among the headquarters's intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessments of the American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the Army Army Military Command in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outputs accepted by the higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive impression of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts that occurred on the ground justified. They were regularly more positive than the analysis produced by other intelligence agencies,” the report said in a press release.
“The events in Centcom are unacceptable – our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
The failures of Centcom's management reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the HQ descriptions and analysis of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that senior government administrations in the Obama administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes the analysts feeling as if Centcom's leaders had put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“For the entire first half of 2015, many of the headquarters’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major attack on the recapture of Mosul could even begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still in ISIS's possession.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces' military headquarters manipulated the headquarters intelligence outputs to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will follow more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense's senior inspector has opened an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings that were consistent with some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessary isolated process from the intelligence evaluation of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process “prolonged the release of intelligence outputs,” worsened the mood among analysts and “gave enough space for different perspectives.”
Schiff and the Democrats said they did not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom’s analysts to reconcile their conclusions with a “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that a Pentagon Inspector has opened an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the Congressional Report as long as the superintendent's investigation is underway.
But he said, “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the Intelligence Community and the Defense Department welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The study has other repercussions than just what the question is whether U.S.-led bombing efforts in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama could rely on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the war efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a dispute more than a decade ago when a research article by Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, said that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. The Bush administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the revolt regarding intelligence from the Islamic State.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the women's field hockey for the fourth time in a row, organizing a showdown with Britain
A day after three goals scored when the team defeated Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
“I have no idea,” he said.
“I’m not really the kind of person who keeps track of their goals.”
But this is what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympic tournament and they share their squad's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarter-finals, and this game determines who finishes first and who finishes second in their six-team group.
The first to finish will avoid the strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have stirred up a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they finished last in the London Olympics with 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a scoop hockey racket for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played for the sport in Drexel) with the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest ever player.
He was not at the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to qualify for the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half with a backhand from near the goal.
India had come into the game for a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time to the left side of the pitch, then twisted into the middle and pulled the ball into the goal, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
This shutout was the tournament's first U.S. goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good situation now,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time is, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem like a constant and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming relay stick that is passed from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlete.
It’s impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in the queue of the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian and future heartbreaker with his dimples, could well be one of the names everyone knows who is presented in prime time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good mood TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all sports equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are the species that are not universally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number out of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations on its presence in the past 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not realize that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan defend their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline is accompanied by a certain kind of underdog charm, partly because in the ear of the uncivilized, it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
The sport has opportunities for amusement, as you can see from the vibrations of the endless bounces of the drawing films, but it also has the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two species that it basically combines.
The word ‘trampoline’ comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions of the championship jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet, and they must perform swirling sequences of movements (turns, folds and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and “flight time”.
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those who want a medal must go beyond gold, faster, up and above - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They're not just hunting for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news, another scarving border: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that's also why watching the Games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new climb, seeming weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen state as can be reached at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 13 (ET), the men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 13.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon repertoire starting at 14 o'clock on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they provide a quiet, charming moment that will most likely not be noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is only gained by offering male athletes to be stared and objectified (as the U.S. male gymnasts suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
‘Generation demonstrates’ in Ethiopia, a long-time U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The spread, demonstration-recorded videos, believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security authorities are beating young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thoroughly investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy. Human rights groups have constantly spoken of the government's opposition, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, detained, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
“If you suffocate people and have no choice but to demonstrate, this is what’s going to happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a college teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition that governs the land use into the stranglehold.
After last year's much-criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat of the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in the parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing. The battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of swirling under the surface, bitter emotions are now about to explode.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during the demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxies.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for the demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better with each other.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not natural allies.
The very long-term Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
“We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the director of the oromo.
The largest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigre people. The people cover about six percent of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“The current administration has no basic instinct like that,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles’ boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in turmoil like this was in 2005, when thousands protested the election, which, according to analysts, seemed to be squashed by the government first and then robbed them.
In the following crackdown, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuting train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of the contempt of the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable region to collapse.
“This,” Abdi said, “there’s a real balancing act.”
Donald Trump Explains Obama-ISIS Claims to Be ‘Sarcasm’
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the dispute over his latest campaign on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly invited this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of the Islamic State’s terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American audience.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during the turbulent period, into a difficult position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump argued more and more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning post on Twitter, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The release was a complete turn from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Conservative Radio Presenter Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump loosen his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, a Republican presidential candidate took to hear him.
The latest storm of review comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of polls falling on the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
I'm escaping to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm in the past.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to go to the edge of a political speech and then go back if necessary.
“I think it’s a model where she tests certain messages that are important to her fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘clarifies’ one way or the other, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's cunning about his statements and know that they're vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Rather than easing his speeches for a large polling crowd, Trump has been even more gallorous in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on Friday showed that Trump is lagging behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump, as a rule, tries to avoid apologies for what he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding their words or misunderstanding their sense of humor.
As he faces an increasingly close look at the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about his volume of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which are talking about his every word and are biased against him.
He made fun of the “bad, pathetic” television experts who are trying to make out of him saying “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for another piece of evidence that he's unsuitable for president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby, only cash-approving place in Williamsburg, which had no wireless network, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street on Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a city that would be renovated into a middle-class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
The revitalized Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unspoilt atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb will be led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and president of the new place.
He started in the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same type of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and the coatings include, for example, capers and browned onions.
The bowls have brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
“Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers,” he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like this.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered to the café.
He says that when the Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized I was enjoying Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited the Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
“Every day fifteen over seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagelia with butter,” he said.
The photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against a soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for the Verb, which would use the coffee from the café as an ingredient.
“I think we can still take up the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also approved the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it on display soon at some point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough for them to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home as he walked in and ordered coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: the paralyzing food of the Depressive Period
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked the refined Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the Foie Gras Pésteek, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and plum pudding for dessert.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat.”
The Brooklyn Heights couple are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, the A Square Meal, which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dish with turkey, potato purée and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the recession.
“The loafs were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from a preparation substance and some cheap ingredient, which was used to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make your dinner.
Coe grinned.
“I’m sure it must have felt like lead in the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, had like an eat-as-as-as-can-you-catch-a-table.
The women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
“At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for the Americans,” Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes such as loafs and boxes became the main foods, and the box was a “great way to use food scraps,” mentioned Ziegelman, because the chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The flesh, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special collections were tested when the number of calories and nutrient content was more important than the taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While conducting research, Ziegelman also prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “It was unreal.”
Peanut butter is by no means suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, head of the federal household agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgeters” and respond to the challenge of converting blobs like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's responses to hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake attitude.
At the same time, when he publicly praised the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he eats like a sophisticated millionaire he had become.
“He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in his almost gold-plated dining room.
He was amazingly out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that “not only offered the most bleak food in Washington, but also the worst-prepared food.”
Many of the eating habits during the recession were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they were writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, about how she could not throw food away.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “He even made people sick.”
There was a wind-hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum foam,” Ziegelman said, adding that the overall trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
The dessert did not contain whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone sank their spoons unwillingly into a sticky, brown paste.

Gilead will be reimbursed for the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. District Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to the attorneys' fees incurred in a dispute over hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from payments of US$200 million after they breached two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvon. This release followed when an American judge discovered Merck's abuses, including a false oath and other unethical practices.
In a judgment filed on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the compensation it was incurred in the event of an action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the lab work on the basis of the active substance of the Gilead drugs sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely captured the ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely captured the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria's Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters to hide in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2000 strainer prisoners, who were held captive by the fighters, from the Allies of the Sharfan Darwish SDF, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons made 10.75 million dollars in 2015, paying 34.2% in federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate's and her spouse's income in that year was US$10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated one million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly 5.3 million dollars in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife, Anne Holton, posted 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting a benchmark for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawing his previous promises of publishing his tax returns.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates will release their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax board for the purpose of refusing to file tax returns.
“Your turn,” Clinton’s campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business dealings, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem, posting an online video on Friday of prominent Republicans calling on Trump to release their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate of the past few decades has done: publish his tax return,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that on Trump has not paid any or very little tax in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Nebraska's Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also running a tax government audit, and that Trump is not “fearing” the tax collection agency, but about the voters.
The Clinton campaign has issued tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a real combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only 100 dollars of their income came from wages, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported 109,000 dollars in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual remedy to prevent elephants from hiking in human settlements - they throw out animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the idea, the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up several years ago together with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use the non-violent four-step way to protect homes and crops without the animals getting injured.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed the tools, we’ve noticed a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Honeyguide Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If that doesn’t stop the animal, the so-called “chili cloud” is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, and then twisted so that only the functioning wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts and bursts into the air of chili powder dust.
One smell is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israel's area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with a Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to the “requests” of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary film Shoah about the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel in Israel on the list of destination codes for the countries.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of the explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there “shocked him.”
The hotel’s prescription onist said it was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s area code,” the employee said.
Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident “a great injustice,” Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
“We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But the even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “gave in” to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” said another publication, pointing out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the charges and called the incident “inspecty” and “apologized” from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
“A clear order not to include Israel in the list of shortcuts was never made,” a spokesman for Kempinski said, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to protest against the government's public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to proposals by Sao Paolo Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing temporary graffiti against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out in one group to support the detained President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate voted on her impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly growing by 71%
After the lifting of the sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
After the expulsion of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have largely shown interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Naturally, one of the most important goals of Iran’s two-way cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totaling US$856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran, in particular, rose by 91.5%, amounting to a total of US$697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to 158 million dollars.
“The growth of the trade was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative Council in Iran granted Iranian citizens about 35 000 visas, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries that are visited by the most tourists in Russia for the first time.
“It’s probably safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
The Scottish Callum Skinner crashed as the British won the cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the British team's trio defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was the anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man, as he snatched a victory over the New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after a modest finish in sixth place at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy has ended his racing career since then.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was the replacement of special sender Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created the void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches in relation to the potential that has now been realized in the Scots.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was just behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included driving Hindes in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert, and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow-based Skinner said, “The comparison is flattering.”
I'm only here to do my best and gain a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After defeating Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, “It felt like there were so many British flags on the pedestal.”
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are waiting for a successful five days in the cycling stadium.
Based on the condition shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
It would mean that Kennyn - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently Holy Day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - the total number of medals would rise to six golds and one silver.
It'd be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which will start today and last for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying this one.
The team competition is always the best.
We'll win it together with the guys.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said, “If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight.”
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in qualifying for the four-person, four-kilometer team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time trial, when the officers invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole host of medals.
After presenting a truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, the least of which have not been the separation of technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexualism and temptation charges, and the end of the racing career of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that the UK's now legendary reputation to reach its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's smoothing future questionable over cut in electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria aluminium-smoldered, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory's owners is about to terminate the distribution agreement, so a cut in all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows the Victoria administration's decision earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the factory in operation will not be extended.
The subsidy for a specified period of 20 years will end in November.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which last year led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The meltdown of Alcoan Portland is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own the smaller shares.
“AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the smeltery physical need for electricity will continue,” it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘refuge agreements’, which were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to pay off in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
All possible impacts on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already “predicted termination” reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by 187 million dollars.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the agreements “won’t affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or secure smelter-free electricity supply.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been on guard both as the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
‘If both factories exit the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just the reality TV star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of the desired September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and modeled at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
“Watching this cover in a room full of people I love made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by an eccentric (or perhaps just the style of the Kardashians?), a scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problematic cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and joined everyone's favorite entertainment, Keeping Up's producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended with a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It’s a clichéd plot of almost every “birthday episode” of a children’s television series (Seacrest says the lines ‘I guess you didn’t think we’d forget you’ with the credibility of a morning bunny), but Kris had to make her other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue place.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's lawsuit first (she shared it with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the highest-selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, it calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, the photos from the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more “celebrities who act as models” than “models that are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary place.
But if it happened that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the “success model of her generation”, would fall into the category mentioned above, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren't the relatives of famous people or reality stars, or young people of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career since Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the bitch of the moment.”
This feeling came to the surface again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
The Community's legal centres turn away 160 000 people every year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres every year, when the sector prepares for the effects of further cuts in funding for its already to the limit.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mainly elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like—are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the Community's limit are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are scheduled to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community's Legal Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s Community Legal Centers are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippling debts, families in legal separation, employees who are unfairly separated – all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they don’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate among complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis, to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Center and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign's head of North Carolina's action threatened a gun employee in February while driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordin, a former software trainee for the state campaign, in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that “it wasn’t going to happen.”
Chief Earl Phillip “took out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said on the cover.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, said in the lawsuit.
“You don’t have to launch weapons to cause the damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused insanity when he told the public in North Carolina that “the people of the second addition”—which usually include gun owners and gun enthusiasts—could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was chosen and allowed to choose the judges.
The Trump campaign said the media has taken his word out of context and that he is not in favor of violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond to the request for comment immediately.
The attempts to reach Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local newsgroup in Charlottessa reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is my Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole belly, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to tremendous effort to make sure that all of our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Local communities alone will create 10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs, and the removal of youth unemployment around the airport.
Similar to the London 2012 Games, some come to the conclusion that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, as well as leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented an 11-billion-pound infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, which was built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, which is supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
In Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad-blocking program are a “cat and mouse game,” said one of the companies that are preparing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-based pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update the program's filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code on its website will be changed around the ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circulated a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “such a backthroe fight between the open-source advertising community and its migrants has been going on since the blocking of ads was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong testament to the great worry that ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after ads blockers on a website on a computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook look worth the investment in this kind of action.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update its “advertising preference” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why instead we've focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway in early hours on Thursday in a case that was apparently a suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a “desperate act” and lay down in the dark on a road where several vehicles were hit by him, Vaudi’s police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but not all of them have yet been identified, police said, appealing to them and all witnesses to the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a ‘logical’ step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
“However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It will remain before the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
The two similar cases of the past five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, both of which had a person walking on a dark highway -- it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of the charges of negligence after he hit and killed a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court told reported.
The court found that the police, who were reacting to the emergency call, were driving in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday’s incident near Morges should call the police on +358 21 644 83 46 or +358 21 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus had to be inhabited once
According to estimates from NASA's new climate model, Venus probably had to be inhabited once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus, with its hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled air, could have ever had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously argued that Venus's slow speed of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
“In a simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun on the side of the day for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a statement.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface for much of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current.
The model produced a story about the evolutionary phases of Venus, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus probably had to be inhabited at some point, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy drops out of Avalanche coaching position
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey, saying the reason was the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Executive Vice President/President Joe Sakic confirmed the report and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have been doing my duty as the vice president and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard during the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the vice president of hockey matters must be fully aligned with the organization's vision.
He must also have the opportunity to influence the decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a mid-range victory, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team hasn't made it to the next two years.
The Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing the Western Conference wild card playoff spot.
Roy, the goaltender selected for the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two for both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Labour disputes between North Sea oil workers over pay will be postponed when all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have been randomly arranged with North Sea drilling rigs run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the United and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process of resolving the current dispute,” the statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by approximately 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The company's remuneration deduction follows a 10% reduction of 10 per cent for contractors in its countries in 2014.
The company said further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people from their payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries, as a result of its operations lightening its operations as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's biggest North Sea labor disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential for the economy of the region.
“We need an economy that works for many, and not only for the few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to have fewer than 1.4 billion dollars in investments in new projects, while the average for the previous five years has been around US$7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades' star cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete list of the Star-streaking speeds of the Pleiades' Star Correction.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars of the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how the orbital times are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the Pasadena Center
The Pleiade cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the group were born about 125 million years ago, and are just now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their top level now.
With their top speed, these adult stars will swell large amounts of star breeze.
When these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star gets older, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger of which make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiads, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, while the fastest spins are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiade star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
“The Pleiad star cluster offers an anchor star rotation to theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and, so to speak, hang their ‘dance shoes’ on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pleiads' rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
