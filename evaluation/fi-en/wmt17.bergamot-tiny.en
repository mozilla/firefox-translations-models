28-year-old chef found dead at a shopping mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and notes, "His things were finally going well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined to be a homicide and that an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a liner chef in Boston, had been given his dream job as a line cheek of Sons & Daughters, a San Francisco restaurant, six months ago.
Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "predict and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and they will miss him very hard," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this tricky time.
Louis Galicia said Frank was staying at the hosts at the beginning, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling a sense of belonging with a family was to make us food, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was a brother drifting along with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Doctor trainee strikes: Calls for new industrial action measures
Medical trainees' representatives have asked their trade union to accept new industrial action measures in their dispute over a new deal.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the entire Council to support new industrial action from early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
Doctor interns and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58 percent of the voting members rejected it.
In a letter to members posted through Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "self-surfaced" issues that he said led to the deal being rejected.
He said: "In this light, the JDC board has voted to reject a completely proposed new agreement and require formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to mandate a gradual and expanding industrial action program starting early in September.
The dispute has followed the fact that medical practitioners have taken part in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, head of BMA's medical trainees, resigned after the vote rejected the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 trainee doctors and students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external consortium?
A life that ended in crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met Tuesday to shake hands and declare eight months of fighting words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression of wanting more than this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, we were shaking hands at the event.
But Putin's smile seemed forced, and he didn't gush much of the heat, even according to his own low-key standards.
By contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "love friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I freaked out on the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness beautching of Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he cited in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offense was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be tricky, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since Nov.
For months, state-controlled media led to a stunning, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown from power in a failed coup last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by continued terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number is down nearly 90 percent.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually resume.
They hope for a late season rushing to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after importing agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
"Thirties there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report shaped.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to an attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge of the snail's fast-moving EU membership negotiations, emerges with Putin, who is keen to take advantage of coolness and erode Turkey's ties with Western countries.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support designated authorities.
Of course, this is a given to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at a flamboyant seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to introduce a "outside consortium of outsiders," as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel Western countries have abandoned them and mistreated them, unifying their efforts.
But those two have big differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but in which Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It can be much to talk about after nearly three hours of initial discussions," the presidents told the press that they hadn't even addressed it.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster in a NATO member of NATO, Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's chief executive, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up those goals.
At this time, the Bank's strategists have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murrayiah.
But it has now been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in place with Scottish customers, but it will not be re-opened from the ship.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of the head office and stock exchange listings, will be changed to NatWets.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more prominence: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand becomes an employer of our investor brand and employees because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time for us to move to a brand bank because basically (we've asked questions) is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the chief executive said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank to customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on customer needs, not our own, I believe you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins at Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
Detor sprays champagne after double wins he has a total of 3000 wins
Frankie Dettor, a racer, secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved a milestone with his second victory of the night on his home track while racing with a John Gosden-trained Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in competitive riding.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggotti, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettor, who won earlier with Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here.
I'm very pleased this happened at Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, this isn't Royal Ascot, it's an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The detator absorbs cheers as he pulls out Predilection to the front after victory.
Two race riders have achieved this milestone in the steeplechase - championjockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the present era, and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical aggravation separates him from others in the weighing room.
He's a wonderful ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for British competition, but besides, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a drastic descent from a saddle.
From drone finishes to flighty landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a rollercoaster ride.
Castings wins at big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month ban, but showed significant strength of character in challenging the doubters and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time to come - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin to fire chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted insider for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin has "premising Ivanov to move away from the head of the Russian presidential administration," but was given no reason for this.
Ivanov's assistant director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the president's protocol and government staff, it says on the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he told Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in terms of drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vaino be appointed to replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, such as Putin, was active in the Soviet security service KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting shown by state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff pulled aside at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012 I asked you to give my responsibility for four years in the debate to give my responsibility to this very complex, perhaps even saying a arduous, mission.
Well, I've been a chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB of state security, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was headed by the state security service FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy leader.
When Putin came to power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after a second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
But this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson booted after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical controversy in a series shooter in Los Angeles last month.
The series of producers, ABC Studios as well as CBS Television's Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and a dispute.
I regret it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series about an FBI agent team is expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it my all for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our incredible team of teams, and, above all, the best fans that the show can have.
The start of the series' twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify fish that have turned up in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes 75 fish could be sandals of wind that the vortex of water has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 yards from the sea, published a film material on the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
A svenom of sterling of PORT 1,35 billions is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined Queensferry's overpass on the North deck as well as the land bridge, meaning the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four brackets between "canoes" that are now being completed around each of the three columns of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 harous ropes.
The sterling project of 1.35 billion is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the economy minister, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building a Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this bridge section alone."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lockdown between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck of the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means the entire lid is ready to be reinstated on the bridge.
Michael Martin, chief of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first shutdown in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shutdown represents the cutting edge of civil engineering.
When the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the road cover of an expanding northern pole, we had to close the remaining section of the north, i.e. hinterland, from the side of the north.
This was done by pulling a northern fairway's land bridge of 700 millimeters southbound.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding.
Huge, because the ground bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3% angle of inclination.
Demanding, because the allowable measurement deviations that the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Fortunately, it all went well.
Rescue on Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'lucky when they're alive'
The three men are "lucky when they're alive" after falling off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alerted at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after crew saw the event developing in the Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on to themselves.
"We saw a boat going closer to men and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helm of Moelfe's lifeboat lifeboat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got going," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third, a 60-year-old man found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were admitted to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to a lifeboat station.
Jones said: "These men who went into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch, but it had somehow come off a boat-driven person when the boat capsized.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pok-mon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Over the past decade, many have worried about teens and children no longer going out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching displays.
Pok-mon Go makes people get up from the couch and engage in some activities.
The display time was originally limited to television, then to video games and now recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see technology and outdoor activity aren't mutually exclusive.
I refer to a fad called Pokshmon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they were born in a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many of the phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
In just days, Pok-mon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pok-mon, which are tracked using GPS, and that can be "photographed" (using a phone screen grab) or "a trapping."
A generation who played the game when he was younger has joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a substantial increase in "average" daily steps.
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game 30 minutes a day, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped to 55% in users who tracked Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pok-mon Go, it only sees training level data.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30, "asnoring from the couch" and "be active every day" have paid no difference because most of the public health warnings are boring and are caring for people who look like unhappy.
But the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly mobile people are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its interests are too diverse to list here.
The great thing about Pok'mon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how to cover three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, defecating joy jokers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
And what about?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications such as Fitbit in the past to monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and use will subside in due course.
However, due to Pok-mon's success, there will be other games that combine applications with real-world activity of virtual reality, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape and healthier.

Simone Biles grabs gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it.
Energetic in jumps.
Go smooth on a boom.
Incredible on the perm.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multi-match title Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world to the spotlight of the Olympics.
He had a clear better overall score of 62.198, than a silver medallist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States with a balance sheet at the final of women's scaffolding multi-tasking individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win a multi-match championship, and a fifth American champion overall. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same category as the best athletes of his other generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated its sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs with a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast to see him."
The final test awaited Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between his burden of oversized expectations.
A return to the family's home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals, would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning a gold and silver medal (in this order) women's scaffolding multi-match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he served as the culmination of the departure party of the Retiring National Team Coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of a future as he went to the top of a long road, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto show - the volt-byeby of his trademark - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit well into the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
From this girl, whom her grandparents adopted as a toddler, found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, when she was on a study trip to a gym where Boorman coached, there has become a powerhouse.
He hasn't lost in a multi-tasking since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants to.
Although Mustafina was in small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
Balance boom and perm, with Biles as the reigning world champion, were waiting.
He topped the boom points of 15.433 and surpassed them by 15.933 perm.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they expected the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose to the eyes of Biles with glitter red, white and blue, when the dream of which he once wrote in his playbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was something of a rematch from four years ago when he was in a shared third place but lost the bronze to Mustafina in a rerun.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, who Americans call a "big mother," was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his perpermanship performance for a return in an emotional turmoil that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for the Biles, this widespread tweet from this previous week by this 19-year-old takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killing shot dead while listening to music in car
In the deadliest attack of Phoenix's first decade of serial killers of the last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl sat in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot. That was stated in a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. On June 12, Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway.
The statement says the gunman standing on the passenger side of the car launched a handgun up to eight times and then fled on another vehicle.
Police said the triple killing does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or another adult victim of stallion stallion stallion.
A spokesman for Phoenix Police, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over four months committed in two predominantly Hispanic districts.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of a home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including a late-1990s brown Nissan, a black BMW of the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that leads to the conclusion that attacks are interrelated and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with his injuries, which later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police they were often sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police bulletin for the shooting, which took place just half an hour before a triple slaying slaying, targeting an empty-neutral van. This is also believed to have been a serial killer's work.
Investigators found bullet seals, bulleted in the seat, as well as bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'The situation will be made easier'
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, love singing, toys and, of course, their mother.
But, unlike a large proportion of his peers, Edmund is small head. This is the result of a genetic disorder of which her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"The first time he came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't agree to this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking rack.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still won't speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows you how to signpost with Edmund's cookies "sing me, please."
"We're learning sign language to him," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language - he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own signage.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetics, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of the uncertain future.
I just asked what was going to happen.
What will happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
I haven't actually asked me a prognosis for a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually give me that.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect stemming from Zika.
Things are getting easier.
You can believe it will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana, as well as southern Mississippi, overflowing their banks and caused a widespread flood threat due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities, and that assistance is already coming to counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's safety and emergency preparedness office, said they would receive requests for high-flying vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard will remain in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five centimetres of rain are expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood guard was in place on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, as well as the River Amite, which flows near Denham Springs, are both in Louisiana, and were forecast to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Alek Krautmann, a weather forecaster, said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said there was a threat of flooding down the riverfront of Ascension County as flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi state state, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Lousian, was at all-time high levels at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, along with his wife and steps of children, were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Sixty-two-year-old Hansford says the water of Beaver Creek, normally located more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says another, close-kward, male toneed him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept going up," Hansford said.
It extended to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen any creek water so high in the 48 years she has lived in the place.
Hansford said both he and his family members all have injuries, and that he is the only one to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to a Gloster fire station, where rescuers stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says flooding "widespread widely" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain that continued since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of Tangipaho County residents from their homes as well as cancelling lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reports that in Tangivahaa, a member of the city council said 200 homes were hit by a flood.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets remaining trapped by high tide.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, shelters have been opened to those who have been evacuated.
"They'll get to return to their homes when water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangihaya County, two dozen streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative officer.
This is going to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Emergency Director Rupert Lacy, said steady rain continued along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have flooded on Thursday, but so far no reports of a flood incident have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain still continues."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was 'deliver's bullets, survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to include groin, leg, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to a hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgeries have been performed.
The family tells the station he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot dead in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one in 32 years old.
One of the men, aged 29, was reported to be in a critical condition; two other victims were in a stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be a shooter.
Investigators tell CBS to Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross-border encounter between multiple shooters.
Attack gun-type casings, originating from various offensive weapons, filled the scene.
It looks like it was definitely a constant fight.
There were shell casings on both sides of the pavement on the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also hit.
No arrests have been made and reports said police are investigating CCTV tapes.
Another six-year-old girl, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet in his hand Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call on this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and Catholic Madison Kocia, is proud to all.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established the presence of women of blacks and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win individual gold in a women's multi-target.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the pinnacle of the sport, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnastics gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" because there will be only four gymnasts at the following Olympics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list continues.
A large number of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
With these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes ever since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities with numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly blacks and Latinos) and we have coached national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit (hometowns) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits to good health, as well as for school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girlpower" by winning Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on a path towards a healthy, strong, successful young womanhood.
Doctor interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved deal with officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of 37,000 medical trainees taking part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was on "unknown soil," and that even small additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to nighttime and weekend work methods to improve treatment over difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee of Trainee Practitioners, said last night: "Doctor practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed deal, particularly as it is accelerating an existing labor crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left to transfer the first group of doctors to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve a dispute through negotiations have faced reluctance from the government side to attend and occasionally deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his doors will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he doesn't, the medical practitioners will be ready to continue industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant delays of nearly 13,000 routine cuts and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved deal with officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend pay for contracted 54,000 trainee doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers employers pleaded with medical practitioners not to strike.
Mortimer said: "Working battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services in already demanding situations, as well as cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caretakers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, positively responding to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that a constant positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England training organisation and the Ministry of Health are on respect for contracts with November, February and May.
A drug paying quip quip a day can reduce risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting quid from a drug paying  little ounce a day after officials recommended giving it to people longer.
A drug that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or second seizure.
NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to continue to lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these get a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulated fat content in the artery wall, which forms narrowings.
If the narrowing ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks down, it can go with the blood and cut off the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft NICE guidance recommends giving 90 mg of ticagrelator to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg taken twice a day with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Center for Health Technology Evaluation, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression prevention treatments, up to a quarter of people with a heart attack later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we recommend the ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to a number of thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since ticagrelor efficacy and safety data - particularly as regards the risk of bleeding - for periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer periods than for this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, a former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the exclusion of widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles chid about police, election officials and city councils to ignore evidence of election fraud because of "racial and religious hypersensitivity."
The former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to put guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present identification when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must simply say his name and address.
The report even suggests putting an indestructible ink on a person voting to make sure no one can vote twice.
Whistlemen should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or a working group.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, it would protect local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report following a vote scandal at Tower Hamlets of East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal acts.
The court found Rahman "quished" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, as well as silencing his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "runed his election campaign on the grounds that it was a religious obligation for loyal Muslims to vote for him."
As many as 300 votes were dubbing or the result of a person voting to appear to another.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud is found throughout the country.
He expressed a particular concern in voting for election fraud by post, saying high-ranking Muslim members of the Muslim community had pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations on the purification of the voting system, including identity proof with ID
He said: "The evidence was presented to pressure vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of elders, particularly in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"Concerned concerns were made to...the states' institutions ignore such behavior because of the 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system. These included denying political activists to deal with ballot papers sent by mail to stop "rolling of votes."
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for more stringent amendments for those who have registered to prevent election records from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at options for proof of voters' identity before voting.
Use the finger of a person who votes in indestructible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit to requests for automatic mail-in voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made mail-in votes and envelopes where votes are sent.
Let the police put guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it's easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polling stations illegal.
In order to use only English (except in Wales) at polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure staff adhere to the rule that a voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric slams the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "mamboyful" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court remained as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal activity by Lutfur Rahman and his clerk," he said.
He was found guilty of unquestioning, according to the criminal display threshold.
He also criticized ineffective "trap box-to-screen checks" at city council voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a revival.
Our nation has a glorious legacy of giving birth to parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud, as well as the denial of facts of certain groups, threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Kate's twin cyclist trip and other celebrity photos at Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone berser from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer to brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look clearly like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: US men's archery team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be a star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his images surfaced, showing frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when she became aware of the social media bigotry, an archer admitted that she has heard from a child looking like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance to itself, except maybe when it comes to beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London from 2012 will surely come to the fore this year: a startling resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's big, expressive eyes have been said to be a double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for many years.
Bigger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actor's 'sporting version'
Another longtime comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has other things with actress Annalynne McCord as tanned skin and blond hair, while US team Nathan Adrian reminds, according to fans, "The athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities
Presenting the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarity of a couple
A Twitter user recently expressed happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress certainly have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to actress Laura Linney's smile, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful, beautiful smile matched Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator makes apology after saying Chinese swimmer 'dead like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-placed message of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle swim rages Wednesday at CBC live Olympic broadcast spectators.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "losing like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonaldin, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring "color," it was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China bluffed, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after shocking the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator say exactly that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'was dead like a pig'????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on live television.'
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200-meter relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China, your jew, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was thick and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves to hear how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau :ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the broadcast of the CBC, apologized lively for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, sorry that this happened."
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russel, a commentator, had to apologize to MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and appended an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made, and that they were sent live.
We took swift action last night and apologised lively to our viewers as well as our followers on social media.
To be clear, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of a swimmer, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry to say.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live on air and tried to determine his remark by stating that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for a comment I made last night after a women's message," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to a swimmer for performance, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say I didn't mean it disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's customer dismayed of woman brazenly fitted underwear amid trade
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underpants.
The things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what he looked like in the pants, a woman shelled them off her head and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually arranged four kneading cupers at a store located at Bouverie Place's shopping centre Folkestone.
Primark's move at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman fitted underpants and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the store, said after trying on underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store's floor, took a couple of shows of underpants, took off her own tights and underwear and put on their befitted feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to atonement, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone stared when he took off his underpants again and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding not to see anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching - or thinking about a person who ended up buying the underpants he fitted."
Davidson, 33, who lives in the town of Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's taking home with underpants that someone else has tried but not cleaned."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I understood that staff apparently tried to remove items of clothing after leaving the woman's departure, which is fine."
"It would be horrible to go home with new underpants and discover that another woman has put them on and taken them off and hasn't been washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestonen store on Tuesday, August 9.
All of those products have been withdrawn from sale."
Here's how to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video at Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrach, the big master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-waving robbers in close range.
Whether we're approaching you front or back, this video shows you how to pay an attacker in kind.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you have to turn around to see your attackers and "clear the line of fire."
After that, you grab a gun between your forearm and shoulder, before hitting the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by striking the groin with a knee, and when the assailant goes out of pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him in the back of a gun in the face and backing down with a gun aimed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab a gun and turn it around so that a criminal can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the assailant in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grasp, back off and point him with a gun.
Sounds like a tricky one?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the grandmaster of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licking Europe's dirtiest places for a tour guide
A British traveller has set a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and distasteful places.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel writer from Suffolk, licked euro banknations, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flushing button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each subject, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
But the experiment that was made into a film on the trail of inner power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train flushing button used by thousands of people may seem utterly repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him with any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester of intestinal endurance while traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This function, stretching from public railings to toilet seat flushing button, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film, he said: "Since a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from dirt, worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of more than 4000 units in the photometer.
By comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public lavatory, he refused to lick when the result of a photometric showed more than 4000 units, and the result of newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler on the trail of the film, Internal Power, along with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because there's disgusting stuff.
Internal power was produced together with Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria as well as C and D vitamins to help boost people's intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and which at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'.
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a greater context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health, and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can use this to be an interesting way to tell more about it to consumers.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the documentary, added: "Let's say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked of him, such as a nightingly Russian lavatory shown in the film, I would have lost respect to him."
Understandably, some of the things licked were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty lickeds recorded.'
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically with stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they sometimes use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
tinged family destroyed a rental house in Cornwall in Saltashi, before evicts
A family of chess caused grams of 10,000 pounds to their rental house after being evicted for terroristisation of neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltashi, Cornwall, after complaining of them numerous times.
After they were severely removed from the property, shocked housing company officials determined the property was in poor condition.
There were gaping holes in the walls, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been chopped with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, manager of Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a nightmare for residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here, because this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups at Cornwall.
This family is disreputable, and their names are disreputable."
The couple had three sons who occasionally lived in a property, and police said the family's reign of terror included a street fight with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and overly screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, named in a lease, was given a decision on anti-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in many rooms in the house under threat of demolition.
The floorboards of the property from which drugs have previously been passed on, had been pulled up.
Neighbours said the family was seen fighting in the street, and that police were regularly called to the scene.
Cornwall Housing evicted the woman and her partner's property by force this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and it's always been a bad situation.
We've seen a cop here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s great to be gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down to a tenement house on a wild wall.
He added: "It's a shame the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and that of his family, as eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very tricky case, as the behaviour was extreme, and what they did certainly terrified neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police, as well as the brave community members who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said three boys all lived in a property at different times, but they were all twenty.
A dirty mattress left on the one bedroom floor after the eviction
Housing company employees now have to clean up the waste stacks surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as a scale, supplies as well as wing ounces in cash.
Skeldo was fined after culpritating the possession of a class of "b-grade drug" to distribute it further.
He claimed the money was meant for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon. He died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and his associates live homeless after staying in a private stay in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house's rooms were graffiti.
Police say they are seeking to evict residents who make fun of the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to make up for blasphemy of the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is without penalty, as well as those suffering from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior. Police are continuing to work with their partners to protect our communities.

The incident happened at Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of numerous holidaymakers posting videos of a dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it would be crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I actually felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training mission to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility of smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
Wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, in addition to four deaths on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low-pronged conditions, smoke from wildfires and thick fog,
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
First half of Exote's Earnings Better Than Expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better profit of EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January to June.
Eksote's profit showed a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where institutional care has been reduced by developing preventive services.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
Eksote is seeking to shorten policy queues this year.
Eksote covers a deficit previously generated by a surplus.
The excess of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote's board will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards sworn in a military oath in Immmola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School sworn a military oath Friday.
The military oath of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts took place in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Jail Course's swearing-in ceremony was held at the garrison sports field.
A military oath vowed 70 conscripts.
Special border guards will be trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border ice hockey.
250 of them were invited to take pre-trial testing.
Special border insurance companies have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of wartime border troops attended a veteran meeting on the occasion of the raffle.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans to attend the event were born in 1918.
A circle ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, one of the 11 Finnish police departments has operated an RTA, a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
The Häme Police Department includes a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant in Lahti.
The Chief Executive Officer is Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian costume.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The creation of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the police would rarely leave whistles in the place of boulders until they get an alert.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will be used to target daily policing operations where it is most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, fewer than three national units, and its own criminal intelligence unit was established in the country.
PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, runs its operations nationwide.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard, as the name suggests.
RTA units, meanwhile, work in areas shared by police departments, and their mission is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because crime does too.
Those working at the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police officers.
The unit uses registers, alert task databases and observations to draw police attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing so, the author becomes a certain image.
Setting can be carried out either on the basis of the act or the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA unit employees do not walk around town collars, but their work is not entirely public either.
You don't tell us about the methods of ownership as well as the methods used by criminals, as it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police crime prevention efforts.
The methods are being reported publicly by police if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such an incident, for example, was the method of marking empty dwellings used in residential burglaries in early summer.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to try to see if the residents were actually traveling.
Pre-trial material is public at least for parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from mistakes they make.
The cleverest ones subscribe to district court minutes, which can show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thrashings with gloves.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Department and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed for the case.
Police collect and analyze information to plan practical action.
Against the background of reduced workforce and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-step PORA reform that ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of one’s own institution and Finland.
ISIS schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly killed Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization's base on the ground.
The slaying was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just while planning an escape from a war-torn country and his return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others, that there are real risks to going to a war zone - that it could dissuade people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will run Garland as Supreme Court candidate if elected
Harry Reid, the Senate's Democratic leader, says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The head of the majority of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says the next president will pick a person to replace late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday to a conference call that he predicts "with some degree of certainty" Clinton will choose Garland.
A Reid's spokesman later said she hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether to name Garland, and that it was a speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "keep a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the District of Columbia, Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "concealing" and "poateners" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit to serve.
Treats says nude calendar is "for women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemeal to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
"We must start presenting timeless and classic nudity in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release with the calendar announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open-ended events in Los Angeles and New York.
vinyl destination: Who actually buys records?
Lonesome, middle-aged men love vinylisms.
Before you rush to fill in the comment section with irritated insults written by the nickname NoAllEntyAverine-aged Men, you will find that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the re-employment of records, much more people who have been born this millennium are getting excited about the novelty of physical objects, but by longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be 45 to 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy records of all are those in the 18- to 24-year-old age group.
Nor is it just a question of collecting enthusiasts, but includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I'd be rolling for a stop, form a cup of my hands and say something prestige, such as: "Let's get closer to it."
Let's do it more closely.
At the same time, when Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supply stores, now fill buildings with independent moves - a handful of stunning special record stores still remain.
For the next section, I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to judge by observing their ages and emotional paces.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, which I follow from Sister Ray (calculation: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends an afternoon in London for a meeting, and circling shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown in the picture above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I didn't follow him to the home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of record and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford to afford when they were originally released, and he can rebuy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records released when there were 11 or 12, records, for which I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and add: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Twenty-five-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the customers he encountered fit YouGov's profile.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that records have come back to fashion and who have needed to buy their old records back.
Based on my discussions, people have usually eliminated their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl reversals of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded types.
Wez said some senior customers were particularly injured by a contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans can overwhelm the digital world and choose to confident in the persistence of familiar sheet covers; objects that bring back memories of teenage days of happiness.
"I think sometimes it could be about filling a gap or some form of comfort to owning objects," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true to many people.
It's an easy way to meet your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said a sudden by a stack of disks.
An April poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point, I would probably look like a serious worrying flipping through the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "reward" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in the Sounds of the Universe (calculation: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We visit people who say, 'I don't have a turntable.'
So not parents, but younger people, late teens who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, which today has an almost full floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their seventies, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier - the loudspeakers are fiddling with Wild Beastis's most recent synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to show a gnashing psychological trauma by standing by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes looking at the various records for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending much money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so record-gathering isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music, either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking into denim shorts, I observed a group of teenage girls who briefly gather around the Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter reflect on buying Crosley's turniter.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered in albums by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection of average collections.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyls."
But given that even the small attention given to these items can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the segment of the population with more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly won't spend their Thursday mornings hanging around record stores on Berwick Street browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter as he peeks across the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living spinal animal - video report
Scientists say a holker has longer lifespan than any other spine on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied harm, says the record is set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years and five metres long.
French court rejects application to dismantle shops from Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should be able to dismantle an overall of 72 temporary shops in which people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cuts or sell tea at 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The agency of Calais Prefect justified the need to unload the sites because they represent taxes on an unpaid parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, to say that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food to the increasing number of people in the camp.
They justified that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ordered that there are no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 temporary shops, but said the concern of the Calais Prefect "was perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-Francheois Molla said food stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding people who are only "intextremity" people.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe of the camp, which operates as non-profit and provides 200 meals daily, English and French classes, and asylum counsel to the hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure of a cafe "it would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - peaking - after a sharp rise in arrivals over the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food in Finland is sharply cheaper to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
Food prices in Finland have fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, food in Germany and Sweden has become more expensive than 1%.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most among EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
In comparison countries, only the price of food in the UK has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on the article of Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
The leaflet compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices came close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed by a twist, after which food has become cheaper year on year.
Now the price is weighed down by Russian bans on food imports, which have styptised food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to price declines.
S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place of low-cost nutrition, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven per cent in the comparator countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must halve the average level of EU countries and continue to price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The leaflet points out that his calculations by VAT rate are indicative.
School is not the same anymore.
Anyone returning to school bench may notice that there has been a change at school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools to be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is an instruction to do business in all Finnish schools.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan states formal goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from old guidelines in many ways.
For example, learning to fiction will be abandoned, and instead schools will be rehearsing.
Swedish education starts at the latest in sixth grade, and social studies are already being read at number four.
But the biggest change concerns the role of students.
They used to think that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest backbone found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks, Greenland (Somniosus microcephalus) achieves sexual maturity at the age of 150.
It could live for another 250 years after that, a new study reported.
The figures make the sport the longest backbone of modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is scheduled to be 507.
Greenland shudders swim along North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are among the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow to more than five metres.
Because the pace of growth is slow, according to the follow-ups, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been forcing to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice shone of 28 females trapped in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon timing of eye lens.
The average age of sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502-centimetre asthma fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice shark females achieve sexual maturity only over four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann sacking nearly 300 - sellers won't be cut
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in a difficult company ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It says the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, about 80 support providers will be offered new work as sellers.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of their need for reductions, the need for reductions was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the amount of the increase aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining profitable from department store trade.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade still makes a loss.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
"Personal reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018,” Veijalainen says in a statement.
The profit improvement for the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter net sales and earnings of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The centre of low pressure on top of the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Long, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be showers in central parts of the country, but further south there will be pouty.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as mercury in the whole country remains below 20 degrees Celsius.
In rainy areas of the north, 10 to 15 degrees Celsius remains.
Kenya's athletics team is shaking doping scandal - quirk of coach's stunt with bizarre explanation
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah was performing as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-meter star of Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to inform Anzrah officials.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home as he "made his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee President Kip Keino, meanwhile, thundered to Reuters news agency.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner is aware of any consequences as to the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year and is pre-empted Rio favourites to win.
For its part, a source inside the Kenya Athletics Team claimed that Anzrah was only using an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in a race village.
When he was met by anti-doping officials, they assumed he was an athlete and taken to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he feared to be exposed," the source said.
- Where is everybody?
Rio's athletics stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
Certainly not watching athletics at Rio's Olympic Stadium.
Rio began a battle Friday over medals in athletics, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty grandstand.
Rio's organizing told reports on Friday that just 58 percent of first-day morning race tickets and 65 percent of evening race tickets have been sold.
There was another four years ago in London, where a stadium flexed cheering people.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The spectatorship of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
In the stands of rugby, padship and horse riding, for example, thousands of empty benches have been seen.
When Brazil's medal hopes, Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 per cent of the stands was full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, with only about 30 percent of the 12,000 stands full.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
Although even the first match of Brazil's football team could not get the football stadium full of.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for race organizers, said at the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, a markedly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell left," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
8.2 million of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics were sold, although tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to more than 1,000 euros.
More than half of tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball at Copacaba's sand hasn't interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and entities can redeem holder rights to land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is distributed virtually to blocks that those wishing to acquire a holder right in exchange for payment.
The holder receives a veto over its 187 square squadium, which in practice means that each holder is not required to be approved if the intended use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire elves for several blocks.
Obtaining a right of administration is something concrete that can be left to inherit or give as a gift.
You don’t have to take banners or shackle yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of administration to his company.
The person who obtained the right of possession receives precise location information from their block, which allows, for example, a visit to a block.
The name of the holders’ rights on the foundation’s website is displayed on the same map where the block information of the land is found.
Leviakangas sees the risk of its nature conservation procurement only that the foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land by either buying or donating.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected land.
It also aims to outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves plague Turku of large cities worst of big cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are most likely torment Turku from Finland’s major cities.
More bikes have been stolen there in relative terms of population this year than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the number of bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the amount of bicycles and parts of bicycles per 1,000 inhabitants in January to August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti came to the top.
According to police reports, four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, double the number of thefts are committed relative to the number of inhabitants," says Tommi Reen, Superintendent of Police at the National Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of thefts may be affected by how much you move on bikes in the city and how many bikes are there at all," ponders Sgt. Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the National Police Board, considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will come to the forefront of the comparison.
The number of bike thefts largely goes according to study and cycling towns.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the police have received slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of last year.
There is no cause for great joy.
Despite the fall direction of recent years, the police are reported to have little over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to police officers survive.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of theft and the thief is caught in blood.
"Cashes are also found in connection with other investigations, when, for example, a drug case can find stolen bikes in an apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act or police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, bike racks, yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term use of their own, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, online.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been aware of much stolen bikes going abroad," Reen says.
Buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns, according to police.
Some of them buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of them may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underpriced price," Reen says.
Special library official Severi Hirvi carries a colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for his working day.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk in that time."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thiefs so much, there's not necessarily hipster value here either," Hirvi from Helsinki reflects.
Siiri Valve, who had quickly visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike snubbed the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike into something fixed, such as a bike rack.
"You will think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a Helsinki student says of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you'll hear from friends that bikes have been taken."
"For the most part, such rags-ups."
A bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of a housing company a year ago.
The bike had not been locked up, so Valve expected to take it.
Under 15 years of responsibility for crimes?
Helsinki to trial peer-to-peer whaling crews from the United States
In Helsinki, so-called peer-to-peer whale crew are experimenting to prevent young people from falling into a crime spiral.
Initially, the experiment will apply to under-15s who are now deprived of criminal liability.
A peer-to-peer crew intervenes in the first offence committed by a youngster.
The idea is for a peer-to-peer crew to discuss what happened with the perpetrator of the crime and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer-to-peer ramparts to make amends.
Other consequences, for example, may include a letter written to a family explaining what has been done and what lessons have been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"In everyone directs the youngster's actions in a more responsible direction so that not everything would be ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer-to-peer crew is inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects what happened to people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of under-15s may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer crew is part of the Helsinki Immigrant Youth project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all needy, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
The paper says the open letter is aimed at Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want party money to be directed to congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, along with his recklessness, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring a roll of votes to Democrats in these elections," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all potential funds to immediately congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-democratic anchorage around their necks.
The letter says the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent within next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not to endorse anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security indicated in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton vows relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton detailed details of her economic policy Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the U.S. economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his mates," Clinton said in a speech.
At the center of Clinton's plan is a massive buckling, 2,000 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The building program is a hand-out to American workers who are suffering from factories after low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a building nation, we have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of the equivalent.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax exile, it will have to pay a departure tax," Clinton said.
He now opposes the Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As a president], I oppose any trade deal that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation released by The Washington Post ahead of Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the economic program announced Monday by Republican Donald Trump for "recommposing only millionaires of this kind."
Trump's proposed slumping cut in corporate taxes Clinton has previously dubbed "Trump a loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making products in America himself," Clinton chiped in.
Such are the ratings of Rio: The games have not glued Finns to the squares, but the mobile application is of interest
Normally, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
Rio's Olympics have so far not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued to squares by 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night’s swimming was watched by 615,000 viewers from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships of one month ago got nearly 800,000 spectators at one time of TV2, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
What has so far been the most interested of Olympic sports is Sunday night cycling and the opening of the fifth day of racing, both of which reached the Olympic Channel at a time by almost half a million spectators.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sport at Yle Sports, is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that spectators are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has dedicated a complete channel.
With 24 hours a day of broadcasting, and there are 20,000 20,000 viewers all that time, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained partly by the time difference - much of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lame interest - if someone likes it now lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the early races, interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports that interest Finns: sailing and horse riding.
Initial ratings have been close to expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which entered the first few days of the games at the Apple App Store as the most downloaded free application in Finland.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're going to go around 200,000 charges.
"We won't get online ratings until later.", Pokkinen tells me
The Rio Areena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says there has been feedback and faults have been rectified.
Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updates have been obtained from the applications, which should correct errors.
Rio's Olympics will be shown on Yle's channels and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some sports on Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the Games every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious to Yle ever, but also the last ones to follow only from Yle’s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be seen on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, Finland’s deepest lake is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technology diving instructor, found a indent of about 20 square metres in Ristiselkä, with a diving computer showing 104 metres to the bottom depth.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to unnecessarily strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Looking so, Päijänne does not reach the deepest of ten deepest ones, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction, August 12, 2:29 p.m.: Corrected the last paragraph in which the lakes with a deepest medium depth were wrong.
Ihalainen from tax cut: Taxation of pensioners continues to be more intense
The taxation of pensioners is still more intense than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to the fore in the run-up to parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government's proposal does not include anything like this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he tells Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in earned income, which reduced taxation.
The issue heated up in parliament against opposition figures grilling then-consumer Alexander Stubb (Kok.) election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it will not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.) is mainly about securing purchasing power rather than increasing wages next year.
He says a tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don't increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s (centre) and Orpo’s messages of a willingness to honour a competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with effort.
He says that keeping up to an agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by social partners, so it should not be defaced by questioning.
That will come to be needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Retuffs to tackle unemployment in a row
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 longer long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising an employment rate to 72 percent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims reportedly in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive to attention and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow instructions from the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to go to Thailand due to explosions, but the embassy guidelines should be followed for caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook following the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach for Finns in Hua Hin in particular to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said there was no word yet on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The ambassador thinks the events may be linked to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and a referendum last week on a constitution drafted by a military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who announced their opposition to the law.
Thailand's southernmost provinces, meanwhile, are smoldering ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He said the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks don't involve international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Associated Press news agency.
In the past 24 hours, at least four people have died in Thailand, with 11 bombs detonated across the country, including tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at a tourist destination popular with Finns, even in a tourist destination popular with Finns in Phuket at night, according to Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded at Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs yesterday and today, according to local officials, have exploded at a popular tourist destination in Hua Hin.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both the village of Surat Thani in South Thailand and in the town of Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travellers, as it is used to walk to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngani and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the military junta that controls Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't incite people to panic more," he told reporters.
Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, deputy prime minister in charge of security, said at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred at tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow instructions from the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to go to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following instructions from the major bursts of caution, Westphalen says.
The Vulnerable Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during Finland’s night and their victims so far.
There has been a bit more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the next attack at Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where it believes it found one more bomb.
The bomb of Surat Thani was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN says two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, bleaching about every half hour.
The Bangkok Post said bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles win women's foursome
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with a score of 60,098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina third with a 58,665-point performance.
Biles, 18, is still pursuing scaffolding championships at the Rio Games with perm, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will of course for the past few years.
He has eight individual world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won three consecutive championships and a perm titles last year and a boom last year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team competition world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: 'Socide has no impact on tourism'
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, is not worried about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I don’t think this will result in anything more amazing,” estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they have not deterred tourists, that is hardly the case.
The department of Huovila’s company is located a few hundred metres from the blast site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9 a.m. local time and said there was no point in coming to the office.
Huovila says both the boardwalk and the main road, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work as usual this morning.
They thought the roadfalls had been put in due to the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops of the main street were allowed to open at around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past three in Thailand's time, traffic on Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who visited the site of the attack, says.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car had been set to burn.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby six.
Another man was immediately taken into custody.
Another ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
Police thank those who gave tips.
Research leader on Russian leader changes: Clear relocation
Russia on Friday made a top-ranking change in leadership in years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, chief of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino of an Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomanator and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling management positions is one of the ways of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power beyond the president to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught up in a fight with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said a change to a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to move to other duties and proposed to replace Vaino, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear position-dropping.
Environmental and transport are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old guards, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place is that Putin is changing his close friends to younger ones.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to retreat in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the town of Jarabulus to not aim for them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters last week gained control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
But estimates suggest dozens of jihadists remained in town at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: We used to mistakenly say that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: Home Office Document Publicity Policy Is Against
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on law.
The Home Office previously refused to hand over a list of participants from the interior minister's events to the Evening News.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and that the information was recorded in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time in the run-up to the rank-and-file.
He injured his backhole early in the season and was forced to miss Jamaica's Olympic trials.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've trained well and that's the key," Bolt told a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantly clagged samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Porina Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he qualified in the 200m preliminary rounds with 21.05.
Bolt, who was 17 at the time, was a young promise that was slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres to crush the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebration of the creators at 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the lamming of his career with a watch.
Berlin-based world records of 9.58 per 100 metres and 19.19 by two hundred still apply.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200m world record and a 19-second undercut, but no one believes it is generated by anyone but Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's toughest contender is Athens' 2004 100 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the title finals once if he has made a chance to get on his way.
In Daegu, the 2011 100-hundred World Cup finals went unrun by Bolt because of a cheating start.
Bolt will fill 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in the youth men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Exposing Rio: two athletes suspected of doping off-spot
According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekonova is also suspected of a doping violation.
In addition, a Dutch athletics coach was sent to my home for a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of hormone epo.
She finished fourth in the women's 100m butterfly in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua says a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday would have found signs of diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female inhibitor Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, meanwhile, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio because of a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan fast running coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass for Ferguson Rotish, the 800-meter runner.
There's no stopping Phelps - historical gold came in show style
Michael Phelps of the United States, the most successful athlete in Olympic history, swims his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200m mixed in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same sport at fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in mixed fashion ahead of China's Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton won't stress much if there's a slight noise in social media or British press about his revealing and extraordinary outfits.
Television is a visual media, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress, certainly with at least enough discreetness - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
There are no backward steps.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be thrilled and perhaps startled, but he stresses that he doesn't want to play a leading role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be in athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dressed.
Can you imagine the uproar has reached the point of Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers do jobs and how big sacrifices they make is OK for me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a stir from nothing if it comes from the dress of the (host of the host).
I'm a little amused if one of them has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests over terror suspicion
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people over a suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the Games' security enforcement.
Police made five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before their release.
All of the suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, people arrested for terrorism are among the same group of members of which were already arrested by police in July.
Those arrested are believed to have links to the Islamic State extremist organization.
The detainees reportedly incited violence on social media.
Messages urging violence had been circulated on the popular WhatsApp service, among other things.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their early game of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package at a basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police let the crowd in after a controlled blow-up of a package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled detonation mission.
Police closed the arena for a suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after police had blew up a package in a controlled manner.
The audience did not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed their arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only let the crowd into the hangar after that.
The bang woke up the Spanish team, which started the Games drowsy, in a sleepy manner.
Spain, who started the races with two losses, beat Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two Games, Spain achieved silver.
Police completed a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the summer Rio Games.
The last time police were forced to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road cycling finish last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their early game of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dam put on Petäjä-Siren - Finn pondered protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren was hit hard Thursday.
The Argentine dam posted Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening start of women's surfing day.
The winds were broken.
The opponent admitted to the misdemeanor.
He got stuck because of the crash, and others ran away, said Finland head coach Joakim Wilenius.
An athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It was not worth doing it then because it would have been pointless under Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren stated.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn remained at 27th place with the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medallist is eighth.
In terms of the tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science extends age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or contiator affect a person's health so that his life gets longer.
Sometimes things that a person can't control can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to middle-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't even have to spend a slashing - just picking up a milk carton is enough.
Efforts have been made to find out the secret of long life with various studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancerous, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small risk of death," especially in relation to neurological or heart-related diseases.
Another study of alcohol, according to which moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on this prevention of gingergae.
They can contribute to the onset of other diseases in the human body.
A study in Norway found how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be surling after the experiment ended.
According to many studies, sex, when protecting against sexually transmitted diseases is beneficial to health.
It can also extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order to get extra years of life, a person must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings extra years, there is no denying it.
However, achieving long life does not require absolute slenderingness.
After all, an Oxford University study found that cholesterol levels of women with a large butt were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete who won medals at the Olympics or an Oscar-winning actor, he's more likely to live further than a regular bunting.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings extra years to his life.
Some of the researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, allows for the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of shopping behaviour for people over 65 found that a person shopping every day, probably less often shopping, is likely to be a parent.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring forward death.
So Calculate a credit card from your hand - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
A drunk driver in a deadweight swerved into a truck
A serious head-on collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koske, Southwest Finland, on Friday evening.
The accident happened in Koske, midway through Koskentie and Sorvastontie at 9pm on Friday.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when an oncoming passenger car drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The lorry remained in its lane standing up after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into a ditch and then across a ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who was carrying a passenger car was pinned down in her car.
Emergency services dislodged the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breathalyzer test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drink-driving.
Post sent loose candy to wrong town
Salon K-Citymarket’s loose range of candys was incomplete because the post office had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by mistake.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our truck to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when Posti delivers the load!
So if there's no traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The store's foxing sign is related to Posti expanding its services to cut grass last spring.
The grass cutting will be offered by the Post Office until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update beat me flanked.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that this issue has drawn is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 splits on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourites to grab a bag of loose candy, even though a few laurels were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti’s Transport Services’ operations, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five sets strayed to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) yesterday and we stopped to do part delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening News.
Teija Haltia was not indignant on the sign, because she found all her own favourites for loose candy in the selection.

He has a comprehensive lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 kilos.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of his soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how hugely Lotta has changed over the years from appearance.
Backlund's before-and-after photo pair has garnered several applauding comments from fellow dieters.
You are great.
We're on our own, motivation hard! one glows.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I own a journey on the same journey.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the final pounds on the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos of travel.
During a three-month course of fitness, five pounds eventually fell.
Wish of family of woman murdered in Loviisa: Remember of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes to remember the victim instead of flowers and petitions for a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarians' Centre has posted a Facebook update relaying the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor and unafraid of work.
Dear friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbours have said that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The killer's tracing involved police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded during a detention situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court Sents to Postal Service for Violation of Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to suspend the salary of an employee who refused to induction, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimated in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the reduced salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the employer’s salary, which corresponded to the share of induction throughout the day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the organisation decision of the Postal and Logistics Union (PAU) on an induction ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision not to familiarise Posti employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by People's News.
Turkey to return to a path of human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, say Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalists’ Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter, the Journalists’ Association asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fires head of his administration - replaces Vaino of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, chief of the presidential administration, the Kremlin said.
It is replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration chief.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close insides, will take special tasks in environmental and transport issues, according to a Kremlin statement.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to move to other duties and proposed to replace Vaino, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during Soviet spying on the KGB.
Ivanov was considered by many to succeed Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned from playing - won't be seen in Premier League opener
The world record record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed to England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is sidelined for a suspension as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported Friday.
ManU paid Italian club Juventus to Pogba, according to British media outlets, 105 million euros.
But the English Football Federation (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left with a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-match ban.
That suspension has been transferred to England," the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
In Flow, the craze of greatness is a virtue
The precise criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event, starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival-goers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dressing.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is being styled with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which will be held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The reason for success is a simple question: What kind of event would the authors want to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think of this.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year.
The goal has been to increase last year's number of 70,000 visitors by 5,000.
This year, too, the festival will feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because we need to finance something to do.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge avenues.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated so that 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant outlets and drink bars are partially decorated with artificial turf.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent of 15,000 people will serve as a venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit grandiose, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our case.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even today great visions are possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of a limited liability company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "cruist stuff," like that construction of a 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In fact, alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
But the event has not been consciously profiled to be particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and willingness to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is nin's legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't combine indie rock, pop music, rap and soul, the festival that combines with soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Not just what's playing on commercial radio.
Iggy's last record is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowerpots - tourists fled horrified
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and blown up by cellphones.
The bombs were placed in a street with most foreign customers.
They were blown up at the same time tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra said, according to CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said a bomb has exploded at bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded people is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is popular with Finns.
No one was killed.
Meanwhile, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet had time to explode.
Thai officials say rebel forces likely to be behind the bombings, not happy with the actions of Thailand's military leadership.
According to local officials, criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police have been tackling the activities of criminal criminal organisations engaged in human trafficking recently.
KSML: This part of new response teams will first go to battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to take a military oath to combat duties after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Head of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are at the end of their training are only those who are in the final stages of their training.
According to the training manager, reservists belonging to the emergency response force will be assigned to the service first.
No conscripts or reservists are told to a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts to immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensation for mold house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute about an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the deal, a serious moisture problem was identified in the house, causing microbial growth, which is dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a demolition condition in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132,000, so a financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court's judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of 150,000 euros.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s legal and settlement costs totalling EUR 47,344.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly because some need to repair the apartment had already been known to buyers when the home was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the reported construction errors were materially more serious than what had been suggested.
Tola looking for a fit home
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm to the aspects mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The fitness inspection report cited air ventilation as risks and imperfections and insufficient control of rainwater spilling along rock levels.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that there was any urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwaters coming from the cliff should be controlled slightly within a few years.
The deals were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it emerged that moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which witnesses said were caused by both rock rainwaters and capillary ground moisture.
In the west side of the house, microbial-contaminated air may have also been able to enter indoors through the porch through the porch.
Mould or yeast that would allow health risk, above limit values, was found in chastity samples in a utility room, a basement stairwell, a living room window splinter, and a basement washroom in brushhouse.
Terraces built without permits
The court also debated whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of a building permit.
The court held that Before the transaction, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo, according to which changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
Among other things, terraces had been built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
But mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider the Court of Appeal to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have failed to comply with their accountability, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finns in the register
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about documents on microfilms in the National Archives of Maryland in the United States, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but Americans, French, Dutch and Russians are also involved.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
Documents and registration cards come from a race agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The Farm Department was under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have any children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of even larger numbers for women who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said gynaecological examinations were carried out on women to determine the issue.
The Department of Races examined women's backgrounds, among other things, by examining church books.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten lifestles and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Farm School wanted guarantees that women were "child loved ones," "savely," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as an SS men's bridal.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, the U.S. Holocaust Museum website says.
Instead, Nazi population politics focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for receiving children.
The German mother's honorary cruising was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "artains" and "non-arsers" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the day of sailing Finnjolls at the Rio Olympics, but was left with the whole bunch of tails at the second start of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure to make another start dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought 17th and three in the RS:X class day starts.
In overall standing, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470 class Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so hanged”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has been the best selling solo artist in Finland from the bartender of the cruise ship to the bar factory of 1995, Sillanpää, who has been the best selling solo artist in Finland, and he is currently in a frenzied position.
A book about the life of a favourite singer written by Mari Koppinen, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career for good and for worse.
Sillanpää’s career rose to a total rise when he won the tango king’s crown in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In 1995, at the request of a man, Jukka Kuoppamäki composed a tango piece to Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
Satulinna’s song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that recording the song didn't go exactly according to plan: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stuck!
Bridgehead recalls in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from the recording of a song that has become a huge hit, you wouldn't know it's sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the trail was still good.
I learned that I don't have to demand a perfect and top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence in the man's most popular songs, which is reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then-partner and the case eventually ended up in texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Törmäns were not what Sillanpää wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record of a true story of his own life, but the words of a song about the breakup were not true, but it was written based on the news of 7 days.
In the newspaper news, Jari’s resignation was reported to be Jari’s excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a complete nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, Jari called the label and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it - and good.
In June, Britons surprised themselves by voting for their empire out of the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of voters were in favour of a resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polling week polls predicted the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for separation, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase "It's the economy," stupid, flew into the scrapheap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics answers to a Brexit disaster from a profession.
The most typical answer is that economists weren't listened to because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of economists for the loss of economic position is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the real British guy.
Many also have the impression that a reduction in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes export industries.
The Economists felt voters did not believe economic arguments because economists unanimity were not sufficiently highlighted.
They were particularly affected by the level playing field of the BBC, which gave equal access to EU economists representing only two per cent of economists representing an EU withdrawal than the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press did not interest to say what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economics are about the consequences of separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom the voters themselves do not have common interests.
Yes, academics in major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming victory of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, an immigrant is congesting your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they went away?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would a Briton get medical appointments if there weren't any of them?
There are also children of immigrants in every school.
How much easier it is for real Briton kids to get a place to go to school if they were removed?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists failed to respond to them, and if successful, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have even more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption will create jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit with Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in a timely manner by drawing up Plan A and B plans.
We were preparing for more detailed preparation for Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-friendly camp, a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
There was concern investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Property funds do not normally have extensive liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We're going to grow cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily quotations of the real estate fund to which the news was involved.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund was valued at the time at HOPA HO5 billion.
In total, the company's funds are worth about quid.
That was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds of UK real estate funds.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten per cent or even below.
So real estate funds prepared for Brexit through very different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the EU exit camp won, Europe went berserk.
In the real estate market, however, the less than two weeks following the vote were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could pose a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together crawled the situation and put it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started rolling, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, instead changing pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling the money out in a panic now.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental Europe funds, for example.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closures of real estate funds’ trades received an inordinate amount of attention.
The open funds affected by closures dominate about four percent of Britain's properties.
Aberdeen's shutdown lasted six days, with the company selling out fewer than ten properties from 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its fund closed to 2017.
There is uncertainty in the air at the moment, and economic growth forecasts have been tangled downward, but the situation does not look "gurrier" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is weakest in 30 years, in addition to a 15 percent sale of 15 percent in the market over pre-Brexit voting.
A dollar studier can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings minuses to London property market
At two in the morning, things didn't look like much.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Power word came to pass.
I realized that this is going to be on the side of plan B,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work immediately.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early hours of the morning.
At the office, TV screens normally prescribed silent tone were recounting news, and usually loud crowds were completely silent to listen to when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his resignation.
When the market opened, display terminals flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
It is not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions after Brexit vote, i.e. by mid-term.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote starts corrective move
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, Britain's lead went on a changeover.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines to the UK's real estate market, and in particular London.
Confrontations of up to 20 percent of London office spaces were anticipated in the coming years.
Soon, a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the murk has subsided, but uncertainty is still surging in the air.
It does not show up on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it's still too early to say much about what will come of Brexit.
So much is still open: how to make a difference and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
Initial data on developments in the London property market have already been received.
Data from CBRE, a real estate service company, of price development, covers about one-third of the market.
They say prices for all properties in London fell 3.3 percent from June to July.
In City of London office buildings, a minus of a minus was 6.1%, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're month-to-month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
This is interesting because Brexit was compared to Lehman’s fall and the global economic crisis that started on the US property market.
Vanhanen thinks the comparison is not quite apt, as this is Britain's home-grown crisis.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has now seen no panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is available as normal.
The repair move could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price correction is no wonder of him - that could have been ahead of us even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that prices of properties in London and other number one cities in the world have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have been saying that City, and especially offices, are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have been pushing upwards for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, with London's population the same.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will become globalised, Vanhanen says.
New players have become marketed from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although debt levers have now been used clearly less than during the pre-2008 boom, according to Vanhanen.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, rising prices levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen, too, began to ease its holdings in London, and turned out to be a net seller last year.
There was some sort of turn to expect, and now it's here.
What about now?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He doesn't dare judge much to assess the future, but says there is unlikely to be any surge of rise.
The atmosphere suggests there is a downward or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more than one move up and down, having been in real estate since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes you're going to get through work out of the pits.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralized, the risks are also decentralised, Vanhanen says.
S Group will start registering shopping information more accurately than before
S Group will soon know what you are eating, as the trading group said today that it will start collecting more detailed information on the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, when information has been collected on the total amount of receipt, the group will also pick it up at the beginning of May.
S Group will follow Kesko, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has mainly been positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes under authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group’s registration amendment.
Kesko classifies its regular customers according to just groceries in ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Lone customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, for example, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no one is planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalo, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product group data, we keep track of receipts at the total amount of receipt.
So we know where shopping was made and on what day and the total amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to the level like K Group or S Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will announce it later.
Ora, however, does not promise to start registering product information.
Initially, an experiment
SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive to date.
Basic information includes not only personal data and address information, but also occupation, education, housing, children’s birth years and previous personal data.
People in the same household and their role are also registered.
S-Etukortti purchase includes the date and time of purchase, place, total purchase amount and payment method.
In addition, S-bonus partners' data is obtained from their POS systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodi Terros and ABC chains, data are recorded at product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have hoped that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the information is recorded at coffers anyway, whether you want it or not.
The willing can check the stored information on S Group's website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the cub becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever punctuated five similar boxes placed in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long to sit down resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog toying it with its favourite toy.
A box next to which Heila sat revealed a can of gunpowder gas-scoring casings.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila the dog.
Security situation and online store main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog to find weapons and explosives, and it will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, work tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action at Customs and have been confirmed after the attacks, says Mikko Grönberg, Superintendent of Customs.
The second main reason for training a weapons and explosives dog for Customs’ duties is postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
With increased internet trading, as many as 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made an online store at Helsinki Airport among purchases, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargoes related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked on checked baggage and mailing.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive detection dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with the police and Defence Forces experts with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs together with other authorities decides what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Helaa is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and a money-and-documented dog Massi.
Labrador Heila has been chosen from a littage of ten puppys.
The criteria for choosing a dog to be selected for the airport include a briskness and a hunting urge, as well as calmness because of the dog dealing with weapons, explosives and streams of people.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker to a customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t go anywhere without Hela at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders get to Heila for a once-off patch.
The Evening News cameraman loses a camera mask for a fast dog, but Heila returns a shield that looks like a soft toy right from the "lotch" command.
Strong competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether training is adequate for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in a job at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to pet a dog wearing work vests, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for customs.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working hours can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active workparts last from only 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a strong competition to owner of working dogs at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to be the owner of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Fiji, an Olympic gold gold in a rugby of a city of less than a million people, is appreciated in the country so highly that the government has set an August 22 national holiday.
The country's public broadcaster said Fiji's board confirmed it after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team's homecoming.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was following a finale in the capital Suva, where a screen was erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging," Maikele Seru, editor of the Fiji Times, told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a frenzied performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola managed 175 pounds on his last attempt after a tough battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature to raise.
During or immediately after heavy withdrawals, he has fainted many times.
No one could tell me why.
Tokola scored 175 kilos of the push in Rio and 145 kilos from the stunt.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get 175 pounds of his thrust in his last, as well as his second.
On a third attempt, weights rose to be accompanied by ferocious roaring.
The body shuddered under weight until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemin Palloseura, which plays in the men’s football league, has signed an agreement with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player with power and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With over ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from around the world.
Little by little, Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora of Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
There was a need for a new striker for RoPS when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Deadly Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar as the real Alex Dunphy of Modern Family, rattling again by showing off his voluptuous body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that leavened much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behaviour to a much bolder pace.
The star has posed for photos posted on social media in very few clothes and taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty outfits.
Winter, which is on the verge of adulthood, has also posted several photos of herself celebrating herself recently.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In this case, Amy Palmer, the founder and chief executive of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to adulthood.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and grown up in the era of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more it looks like a bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in Modern Family when it was only 11 years old.
The actor has outraged some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so tough," notes one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, by contrast, defend the actor and urge you not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You're an inspiration to many women, enthuses a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by northern lights: In autumn, it is possible to see a fairy tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start northern lights trips in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lighting Travel are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter northern harvests are in demand, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts from an early autumn and continues well into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, in which the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making a fairytale of vision two odds, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-olds aged 25 to 35, who live in the city, dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by, for example, online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese visitors compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights in Finland, and Lind says the Northern Lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they had more than double overnight stays in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland’s tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese users spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as champion course organized by Fidin leads gold
Great Britain's impressive advance in the rugby tournament slumped to the final challenge of Fiji in Thursday night's final as the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master class in handling, bitten, dodged, support play, running lines and shears when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss came with a reasonable consolation of a silver medal - Britain's third - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic Rugby start tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 win over South Africa in a semi-final earlier that day might have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top-of-the-table team of 15 people in this condition.
It may be possible to consolate the UK - but probably not - that at least one Brit has a gold medal on their necks tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
The UK trip has been quite a bit of a trip.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but development is startling.
Fidi made an excellent start to fend off Great Britain's tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running into a bus moving into the bus, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolisau dive into the finish zone at a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwa's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fiji.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another goal from a new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through Great Britain's loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After a goal kick, the situation as we went into a break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's actually the case.
The UK made a bunch of changes during the break that blocked the Fidin Dam... for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was fine until Josua Tuisova scored a goal after a Fidin impressive pass game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for Great Britain in making a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's jubilant approach.
Mata Viliame on his last-minute goal was a frosting on Fidin's cake, which didn't need to be frosted.
The pill was whistled, the Chefs hugged, and the UK fell to the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan's semi-final 20-5, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final, with each scoring one goal - Britain's goal kick-off decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with dazzling leg work and scored below goal posts in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony, England's 15-advertebation rugby team, secured victory and ultimately a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer boosted Helen Glover and Heather Stanong to rowing victory
There will be no more emotion-supplished gold in these races, and it really means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 tough yankings towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in Estacio da Lagoa from their golden moment.
Although they rowed by themselves, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time as the two raced their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's pairing - the first women in British sport history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearances undefeated, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes attaching a surface with swan adorableness, not entirely reflected in the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually promote those things that matter. And no pair of hands was as integral as a coach who, 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was a close situation.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things to cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it will spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start their treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, causing minimal disruption - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walking around the wards - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first thing to do was Williams, who had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual to try to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a captain who experienced Afghan deployment from a royal artillery regiment, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin, too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their rivals didn't reach.
Even in the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very attached in an instant.
Helen shouted "perhap in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good rowing and winning the race, and that's what we did.
A couple wait a year to decide their future.
Glover will attend a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland changes government wallowed by Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by Panama data leaks were calling for in spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed several Icelandic politicians evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's fury of last spring will affect the election result of autumn.
In June, the criticism of those in power in the presidential election was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran for election from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic to claim Obama to be ISIS founder
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest outcry.
He said he was sarcastic to claim that incumbent President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to form an organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone run as commander-in-chief of an army who can sink that low,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini swimsuit popular among Muslims on bathing beaches, according to reports including the British newspaper.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone without a good habit and a uniformity of secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandiosely express religious links could increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming waters in the Oulu region passed a sieve - Blue-green algae cement in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for swimming water.
Only blue-green algae spitting has been detected at the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all bathing waters of swimming waters of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria of swimming pools under the operating limits set in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The levels of E.coli and enterococci in the sea Cape Beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green marjord observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make water unwielding, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae pulp in ferries.
Environmental action is monitoring the situation through frequent inspections.
If blue-green algae cement becomes a blue-green algae flower, the matter will also be communicated separately on the bathingroom's notice board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the finance ministry's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted based on gift tax on the generational change of forest farm.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, increase forest space size and increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agricultural Producers and Forest Producers (MTK).
But Hakkarainen finds something to criticise about the tax change bill.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the clean capital income of forest owners.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the proceeds of wood sales.
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment’s proposal starts from reducing the reduction in the clean capital income of forestry to prevent it from falling a loss of capital income from forestry, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if you don't sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the yield value of forests is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in Hakkarainen’s view.
As such, he says, it will cut 82% of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership community, he says.
The MLM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing space size.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been made for decades in forest policy.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm caught motorists in Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and hit each other
There was a special rear-end collision on Friday morning.
Emergency services said two cars driving in a row swerved into a ditch, after which a person in the back crashed after a driver ahead.
According to on-call fire chief Harri Pyyhtiä, the derailment is suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
The car behind the drive had two people, both of whom were transported to hospital for treatment.
There are no further details of their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving ahead was not injured.
The accident happened on Route 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of cancerous tumor increases cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such an environment.
Ivaska said the cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of drug treatments for cancer by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue.
The study results have been published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications of the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues at court, prosecutor calls for murder conviction for another perpetrator
Muhos' family home killing continues to thrashing at court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
Another received 8 years of four months of, among other things, manslaughter and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and driving an unlicensed vehicle as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by prosecutors, plaintiffs and a man with a harsher sentence.
The prosecution is seeking a man with a lesser sentence to be sentenced to a 12-year prison sentence for a murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The district court said 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit at a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who suffered a murder conviction attacked a pilot sitting behind behind on a living room sofa.
The director had gotten out of the grip and led to the young person's room, causing one of the youngster to hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled with management, punched and kicked to the head.
According to a mental evaluation, both convicts were fully understood at the time of the act.
The court heard the youths had planned to escape the family home from at least from day before.
Ice shark is the longest backbone in the world, does not increase until 156 years old
Ice shark has been confirmed as the world's longest living vertebrate vertebrate, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, an ice shunning around Greenland, or a vault, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't reproduce until 156 years old.
The lifespan of ice shark is increased by the fact that it only increases by centimetres per year.
Only a species of clams is known to live longer than ice damage.
Scientists discovered age with radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
They allowed researchers to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing one way or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Scrat - People's News
Donald Trump's America needs no other world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenues would miss out on if Donald Trump's pushed for change to corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, particularly through tax breaks of the most rich.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary show when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of tuneless, 10,000 billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6%, after Trump's cut of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and pushing small businesses into bankruptcy.
Ended environmental standards of emergency must be re-cut and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be rewaxed.
"experts instead of bureaucratics" must be appointed to the administration.
"Despicious" trade policy is one of the main causes of US problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be dissociated.
Imports from China would be taxed at 45 per cent and Mexico 35 per cent.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America needs no other world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to oversee seas, American steel to raise all over the country to raise new skyscrapers.
In contrast to his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite the fact that well-organised protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program on Friday.
An attack from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally turmoil, but an actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street whistle - reckoning with the past can begin.
That's the essence of Pedro Almod-var's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directorial work Travel lovers (2013) was a tiny and ronish-side satirical comedy, the pre-explored I'm living in (2011) to peaks of the Spanish guitar career.
In terms of standard Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a serediacle of a conventional woman's serene love, relationship and family drama centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and we see a large long flashback.
Life seems to be modeled by a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything risks imploding.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) is to be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliea times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta’s young teacher Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, is a TV familiar from the series between Ommelates (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been taken care of in a way that can be considered a stall, but I'd say, quite a bit and literally with a one-time wipe.
For Almod-var films, often such distinctive splashiness, up to humor, there is a fair distance in Julieta.
It is an evenly energetic act, low-key, place in some places with good music and quite saddening film, with elements of elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is there and in such a way that it begins to stick to the eye slowly as a more pure form of detail than a functional dramatic power.
The characters in the film are tested by illnesses, deaths or otherwise sudden losses, but the surface remains equally chilly.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name character, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same goes for spectacular earrings.
Almod-to-one is accurate in these matters, but the main point of view, the current seizures, is not particularly improved.
In a mechanical repeat, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodings has written a script based on three novels by Alice Munro of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodingvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat equal literary literary literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably even more robust drama, that's how big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of a movie deals with.
Directed by Pedro Almodingovvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Cast: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on Aug. 12.8.
Government tries to quirk - People's News
There will be no new cuts, saying ministers, to prevent the True Finns from collapsing completely.
But cuts decided in the spring are being carried out to be scrapped.
There will be no new cuts.
The already decided 4,000 dollars will be enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.) assure under a budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because social security cuts were decided already in the spring spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment protection and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
Education cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so much that no new cuts are made to do on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections will be held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
We have seen before that the municipal election result of government parties, which takes different directions, will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, Gallups say that the governing party True Finns face a ruck defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new councillors, of whom a large part of them will realize the price of influence in a right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three roughly as large parties is dependent on the can of the True Finns to endure.
Now it hasn't lasted, more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation space have also surfaced.
There will be no new cuts in rhetoric, first of all, obscure the fact that next year they will be done drastically and, secondly, to soften the attack that awaits the True Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The Government has set a target of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal, EUR 5.9 billion of debt will be taken next year, which is more than this year.
After the local government, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: indebtedness was not slowed down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means, on top of the former, new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring of parliamentary elections, what will be taken into.
These measures do not fold in debt
It is quite clear that current measures do not fold in debt, even though Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at a press conference at the press conference prove it irrefutably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no traction from an international economy.
Since the collapse of 2008 has seen little rise in Finland’s national economy, except during the stimulus policy of stimulus in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% this decade and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
At the visitors presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, debt recovery from the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be covered by virtually entirely new debt.
This is the perception of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the True Finns of what is responsible.
Survey: You want to leave a lot of tasks for municipalities
Three out of four consider that organising child day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also roll over the responsibility of individual municipalities for libraries, culture, community colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The county’s responsibility for regional planning, specialised health care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities are most clearly responsible for the county.
No municipal duties are transferred to the state.
Underage drunk driver ran away from police at end of chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie at 1:30 a.m. on Friday night.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle driving without lights, but a young man set off running away from police at a fair speeding high.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footer officer ran a fugitive shut.
A breathalyzer test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The incident is being investigated as a serious endangerment of road safety, among other things.
A stone-launched truck overturned in a ditch
A truck loaded with stone cargo overturned in a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie at 9.15pm on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and overturned on its side into a ditch.
Emergency services lifted the injured driver away from a fallen truck through a door above a fire helicopter, together with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the owner of the vehicle to lift the vehicle.
From a fallen truck, hydraulic oil spilled onto the road, which was absorbed by emergency services into peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at Ilmajoki
The 87-year-old woman has been missing in Ilmajoki’s Lahti Village in South Ostrobothnia since the afternoon.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres tall, slim and fine-thusked with white hair under the chin.
Findings and tips about lost movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre's hotline 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see a photo gallery of the damages of Parafest
The downward flow of downlifts that brought down the junkies of the Parafest festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, President of Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get back on its financial foot, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer, Kalle Salonen, performed on a market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1pm.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program will be held as planned.
The rush flow occurs in a thunderbolt when rainwater and its weight trigger a drop of air flow.
Changes in the state of the thundercloud water contain heat, and consequently the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several crash currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of plunging flows is difficult to predict.
The plunged current hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents overturned, with about 200 people in tents totaling about 200 people.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported mildly injured for further treatment.
Air pollution ageing on Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
Caci, a British skin care firm, analysed the most toxic fine particles without London and their effects on skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, say, a peer who lives in rural areas.
Skin-fat particles are very fine dust pollution, originating from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, nearly 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Caci's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk their commutes in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular cleansing of the skin is recommended for a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed to push man standing in front of him
The man had moved stones in his yard by tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to go in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man did not get hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination seriously injured.
The tractor didn't have time to run further, as it crashed into the rocks in front of them.
Riento with new powers for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento from Joensuu, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will go to a series of better starting points in October than in recent memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
A common ground can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues to be Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
From a foreign trio, center interceptor Fred Musoni begins his second term in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who featured in Rwanda's national team, is a 205-centimetre chipper.
Garchet is a passer, respectively, a Brazilian measuring 198 centimetres.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Cups since 2003.
Now Tampere is already going to the sixth races, only 2013 was missed by Canada after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The USA was establishing a national floorball team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at SM-level as floorball.
The fire was played at university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji ice hockey in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball championships in the 1991-92 season with the university club, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series for 10 seasons, with a balance of 51+34'85 in a balance of 51+34'85.
The most recent SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Perttu Puska, a gymnast of a Joensuu-based floorball club, and the unclean-based Tatu Väänänen were selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki Erä, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before him, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4 to 13.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a thigh trouble and is among the national team's standard equipment with experience of 117 national games.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of Seinäjoki Pelivelji, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in a Finland shirt at last December's World Cup.
The head coach of the national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volley Championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
Over three days, medals are played in both adult and youth leagues.
In collaboration, the top six pairs of each series of each series qualify for the Finnish Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation’s Finnish Championships.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäen YMCA, who has been among the Finnish beach volleyball peaks for several years.
Hasu, who now lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people get to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena to the baseball stadium.
I have not played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in finals at home, Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark to sport and gave good lunches to a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at age 9 in E-girls at Elimäe YMCA.
The top is a jersey that is too big in mind, kneepads spinning on your ankles, as well as huge ace screams and choreography after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, a sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team's team spirit created an environment comfortable to play with.
Everyone's families were heavily involved in the action - the team-mate's father coached us and our mother was the club president for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volley was already a natural choice of species to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
We've been playing a bit at the arched pond beach since the 1990s.
The activities at the goats have always been active.
I also went to watch the junior Finnish Championships races I thought I would be there one day to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM-gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last to be Hahu’s last familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges of civilian work await.
Yes, the international career is over after the race tournament.
Otherwise, flip-flops will be put on a nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash poured tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was imminent
The crash current knocked down three tents at the Parafest Festival for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were about 200 people in tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
The two tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, the fire chief on duty interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
The newspaper said the event's follow-up is at stake.

Salomon Koli bravely left to become a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial dimension means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farm entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working with his younger brother Valtteri Koli almost two years ago to continue their homestead.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt-taking and farm size magnification to make bread come in hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always been happy to go on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything in the game.
If anything starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yardless tap, and at first the bank wasn't enthusiastic about it either.
However, I went along with the project and I have been fully involved in it,” Salomon Koli says, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything will turn to good again.
The goal of Salomon Koli, who breeds meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of a young food producer of Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% were reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% (August 2015 to July 2016) in the last 12 months when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (since December 2016 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household items and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat' 'anime' effect is criticized as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has been the source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its approximately 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into pineapple, dog, or character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial features of twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past with accusations that the app advertises a blackface, or "blackface," mask or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised some users this week to give them a crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a "yellowface," or yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated polemics could be a sign of a bigger problem with the company regarding diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others denied anime comparison vehemently.
Grace Sparapan, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were widely shared, said in an e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is tricky to argue against a comparison of a felony Asian carocutice and filter effects on side by side."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degradability.
Snapchat isn't the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporation meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of more diverse young people more diverse than their racially older ones may mean they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much more difficult to be undetectable to these types."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and concluded his voyage with the hashtag : : : : : : : : : : :: : : :
"Either they don't have diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, "or have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinions, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racialisation of its staff, but a representative said the company hid a recruiter some time ago to focus on under-represented populations and take forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said, to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like ours to say this isn't OK."
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence data
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said authorities from the headquarters of the US armed forces' war zone tweaked intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS, as evidenced by events on the ground.
In an interim report from a working group set up by the Republican Security Committee of the House of Representatives, Intelligence Committee and the Defense Qualifications Subcommittee, found "prouding dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at headquarters, saying supervisors were tampering with their assessments of Americans' efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is an armed forces war zone headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Remote outputs approved by more high-ranking Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than those that have occurred on the ground justified. They were regularly more positive than analyses produced by other authors of the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking policymakers," said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
Centcom's management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details constant problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqis troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration administrations have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes the analysts as having known each other, as if Centcom's executives put pressure on them to describe the threat posed to the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"For the entire first half of 2015, many of the headquarters's press releases, statements and testimonials to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
The Centcom official, for example, publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still held by ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence directors at the headquarters of the U.S. armed forces' war zone headquarters manipulated the outputs of intelligence at the headquarters to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created a task force after hearing analysts raised concerns about intelligence from an Islamic state being manipulated.
The report, published Thursday, will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The inspector general of the Ministry of Defence has launched an extraordinary, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released their own findings, consistent with some final conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"District between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessary isolated process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief Democrat, said in a statement.
Schiff said this process "tenped to release intelligence outputs," worsening mood among analysts and "given no enough room for differing perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to align their conclusions with "pre-existent or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on preliminary results of a congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon superintendent has launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is under way.
But he said, "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome to these essential national security issues."
The study has other repercussions than just the question of whether U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on headquarters to deliver honest assessments of military action by Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects more than a decade ago of a dispute when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. The Bush administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
Officials said last year, Hooker's team concluded that despite the opposite public statements, airstrikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the finances of a terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through a black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators viewed his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
United States wins for fourth consecutive women's field hockey to hold a showdown with Britain
A day after scoring three goals as the team beat Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure he had done the same thing in the past.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But this he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 4-0 Olympic tournament and share their group with first place with Britain, still unbeaten after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States face a first-round final game on Saturday.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who will finish first and second in their six-team group.
First to avoid a strong Dutch leader, a second group leader, a little longer at the start of quarter finals.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, Americans have sparked a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they missed out on 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up at Pennsylvania's Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played a sport at Drexel) in relation to the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get into the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing worked for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London that we have now.
We've done an about-face.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half with a backhand shot close to goal.
India had entered the game with a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at a 1-0 reading until the end of the third set, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball long into the left side of the field, then circled into the middle and yanked the ball to goal, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added to the fourth set of the final goal midway through.
This nil game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good spirits.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampolin peace amid Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are underway.
Rio de Janeiro's events feel like a constant and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton to a archer to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathletes.
It's impossible to turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to a conversation by a fellow next to a telegram in a queue of a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic first-time Olympian and a future heartbreaker with a smiling doctrine, could well be one of the names known to everyone to be introduced in prime-view and supported by sponsorship deals and good-hearted TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest in California, is competing for Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all the species so much.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not universally accepted by all air pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favourites, I'd like to draw attention to the understated charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations over the past 16 years that many people I interviewed did not realise it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance until the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually distribute women's medals for men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan defend their London gold mitt sandwiches.
But Trampolis involves a certain appeal of underdogs, partly because it sounds more to clown school to the ear of the uncivilized.
Here I have to acknowledge that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
The sport has opportunities for amusement, as noted by the discoloration of the never-ending bouncing of drawing films, but it also has a sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumping, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampol, which means a springboard.
The championship goaltenders jump on a giant trampoline to a height of up to nearly 30 feet, and must perform twirling sets of motions (turns, folds and volts) and eventually descend to their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they will be judged on implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those hoping for a medal to go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the court.
They are hunting not only a finish line or starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another taunting line: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that's also why watching races can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline provides a moment of rest from this.
Trampolin is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a re-emergence, seem weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but there is no ferocious rush to the end of the rush to the end, no jumps to the distance, just the dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as you can get to the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 1pm (ET), the men's races also come on Saturday at 1pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon programming starting at 2pm on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic heat, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not to be noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved by offering male athletes to stare at and objectifying (as the male gymnasts of the United States recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a groaning new fan base.
'A generation demonstrates' in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable nations, a firm ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, calling for a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The spreads, videos recorded at demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or early this year, show how security officials are hitting young people with sticks while being forced to stand against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations chief human rights authority is now calling for a through-packed investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager at the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate stability.
America's military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country gets so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy has been growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa even has a new train for commuters.
The city's streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy. Human rights groups have been constantly talking about government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, captured, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth demonstrate.
One generation demonstrates.
Complaints are diverse and cover all land use into a strangulation grip of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's much-graced election, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing. The battle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, can try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of skybreaking, bitter emotions are now bursting.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate the location through hidden network proxies.
Many young Ethiopians said this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, ortoms and Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and Amhara are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amults, coming from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, thrived in politics and business, taking advantage of the orodums, many of whom are Muslims and who live in lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"We are on our way to organize under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oroms think Ethiopia is dominated unfairly by the tigre people. The people cover about six percent of the population and dominated armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to commit opponents to make innocuous.
"Curgents have no basic instinct like that," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, which was from the tigre area of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the gigrush-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear this could lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in power of such turmoil was in 2005 when thousands protested of elections that analysts said seemed to be shamed by the government first and then looting them.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters killed, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unease passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuting train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of domestic Ethiopian government contempt.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara town of Ahara in Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-Ciscrat hatred becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flying to neighbouring Somalia, though it said some time ago it had closed this base.
Although Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable allies of the region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is real balancing act."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-Beying ISIS claims as 'sarcass'
Donald J. Trump tried to crack down on the latest dispute over his campaign on Friday by claiming he was not serious when he insisted this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to American audiences.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in a tricky position in which they have to explain remarks he doesn't necessarily mean.
Following a hint at Wednesday's campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that he was indeed to say that President and Clinton created ISIS.
In an early Friday morning Twitter release, however, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump shy away from remarking by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate has taken him to hear.
The latest review storm comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid downgoing polling poll results.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
I'm back on Twitter, he warned Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained to the remarks by saying "I guess I'm sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to visit the limits of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clear you're going to 'clearance' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's slyt about his statements and knows they're vague enough to filter them through multiple lenses.
Instead of relaxing his talk for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more galling in recent days as his popularity has continued to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Survey published Friday showed that Trump is failing to track Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, as a rule, he tries to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstood his words or misunderstood his sense of humor.
As he faces closer scrutiny over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend a candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about veracity in relation to Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the news media, which grinds out every word of him and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to make up about him saying "They're not gonna work!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence of being unfit to be president.
A previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-approving location in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the downside of the Bedford Avenue was too costly for it.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soapy cake-shaped soaps.
Locals lamented it as a recent loss in a city being renovated into a middle-class renovation.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is a soap store these days."
But if New York is a change, it's reinventing, too.
The revitalized Verb opened last November to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verbi has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unprecious atmosphere.
Coffee is good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of an old cafe, the owner and chief executive of a new location.
He started at Verbi in 2001, and was there to the end.
When a client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagels supplier and bought an espresso machine of the same design.
It even used the lights of an old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought some new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-bowl-cheeked cheese sandwiches, and the coatings offer capers and browned onions, for example.
There are brown rice in the bowls.
You don't serve beer at the cafe anymore, but fresh juices are made there.
Over nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Williamsburg was also too costly to many former customers," he said.
Last Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like this.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered to a cafe.
He says that after Verbi closed, he gave up coffee drinking for a moment.
"I knew I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he's back to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, went to Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before working and always placing the same order.
"Every day, fifteen more than seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
A photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, due to variety, she orders spicy bagnel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he holds no grudge against the soap sale that took over old facilities.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verbi a special soap to use coffee cold-extracted coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we can still seize the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu in Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to bring it up soon to get his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe expands to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it's enough for them to get their old favorites in the new Verbi.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new location opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depression-Gaming Food
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his official chamber.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as a foie grass, and Maryland swamped turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with people suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life from a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, the A Square Meal, to be released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet at a journalist's dinner at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpredictable lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-veiling sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the portion with turkey, potato puree and veggies.
When a reporter ordered meat loaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating a recession.
"Murcades were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, bean pancakes.
They were made from ingredients and a cheap ingredient to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe grimaced.
"I'm sure it's felt lead-heavy in the stomach," he said.
Years before the recession on American tables, especially in rural areas, there was like eating-so-a lot-like-a-ks-nooking table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery food types such as tenderers and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was a "awesome way to use food scraps," cited Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compilations were tried when calorie counts and nutrient content are more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In making research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman also prepared an era of a dish of fried bulbs filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is by no means suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household prescriptions.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Homeholding Agency between 1923 and 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Posting recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to start becoming "budgeters" and meeting the challenge of converting lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the stories of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake attitude.
At the same time, when he publicly praised the simple, Iwa rural food of his childhood, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with soup sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxed in a nearly gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of it all.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered one of the most trapped in Washington, but also the most miserable food."
Many of the lame-era eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Inherited is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing a book, they achieved a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even sickened people."
A wind-happy incident occurred.
After empty plates in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the desserts they had prepared at home: prunk dessert, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
The dessert had no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone unwillingly embedded their spoons into sticky, brown pastes.
Surprisingly, it was not evil.
Coe snouted once and another.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "a little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead to reimburse attorney costs in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to attorneys in a dispute over hepatitis C patient in a dispute over drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of buckling payments after they fouled two Merck patents related to Gileead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvo. This release followed when a US judge found Merck's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to be released from compensation incurred in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gileeadin, who controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can improve well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of laboratory work at the bottom of Gilead drugs active ingredient sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken over a total ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have captured the entire northern Manbij town near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 Sivet-lipant prisoners, considered prisoners by fighters, Sharfan Darwish of an ally of the SDF, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
"The city is now entirely under control, but we have set about investigating it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn buckling quid in 2015 paying 34.2 percent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the revenue of the Democratic presidential nominee and her spouse in that year was 4-0.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated quid quid quid quid to stallions, mainly Clinton to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton, earned nearly 5,000-dollar payouts, and the former secretary of statehood announced 3 million publishers, Simon & Schuster of his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia with his wife, Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a yardstick for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a steep contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and reverses his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
The custom says U.S. presidential candidates will publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige it to do so.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers, have appealed to a tax administration audit of the culmination of refusal to release tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter as he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were ready.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem of posting an online video on Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate of recent decades has done: publishing his tax returns," he told the audience.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little tax in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that those earning more than phonic dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, based in the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has an ongoing audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not "fearing" a tax collection agency, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, had a real federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a real combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only bucks bucks worth their income came from salaries, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported quid quid with quid and fixed income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from trekking into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chilli powder.
The Keino has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, with the American Nature Conservancy, has boosted its advertising by training volunteers in villages of northern London to use a non-violent four-step way in protecting homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed... tools, we have detected a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing the trumpet.
If it doesn't stop an animal, throw a so-called "chilip flat."
The condom is filled with a mix of chilli powder and soil and a firecracker, after which the condom is closed so that only the fuse is left visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts into a bounce of pot and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
One centenary is usually enough to send an elephant in another direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin-based hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French, Jewish-based filmmaker unleashed media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list an Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to "conditions" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Holocaust Shoah documentary film, vented his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find an Israeli hotel area code in the country's signcode.
However, the country was not mentioned among states to call directly from a hotel room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In seeking an explanation, the filmmaker raised the issue at a hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there "shocked him."
The hotel's prescription ballifier said it was a "premeditated decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more outrage in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand removal of Israel's Illusion," the employee reportedly said, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the incident a "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
That is a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a response to the web when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gifts" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on," another publication pointed out that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands close to the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "inaccuracy" as well as "application" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"The clear order not to include Israel in the quick selection list was never made," Kempinski's representative reportedly said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo as students gathered to demonstrate against reforms to the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, leading police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended a demonstration to express their horrors of plans.
According to proposals from Sao Paolo state Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 pupils would be resettled to save money.
Some of those attending the protest were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after protesters launched as a force to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted for impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran grows by 71%
Since the sanctions are removed, turnover in trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
After international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a high degree of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue to tie existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of two-way Iran cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of nornum of nornony million.
Russia's exports to Iran, in particular, rose by 91.5 percent to total nil nil nil.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to DP 158 million.
"The growth of the store was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's foreign delegation in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most of them in Russia for the first time.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. Monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good shape," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner plunges to goal as Britons grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner clinched glory in the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night when the Great Britain team trio defended their title from London from 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scots colleague Sir Chris Roy excelling, the legend was proud of the youngster when he raced to the finish line from the favourite New Zealand team of the win.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after a modest finish for a sixth of March's track racing world championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was replacing special sender Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man in whom British coaches attached to the potential in a Scot, which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the title with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in time trials, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel of gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed into the team lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, drawing the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped to the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow, said: "Comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After beating Kenny and Hoy alongside Kenny in London in 2012, Hindes admitted he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain's rivals haven't complained.
This time there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like you were in London, when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection within the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply stunning.
One event, one gold medal for the people, winning seven of 10 cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will face a successful five days at a cycling stadium.
Based on the condition shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic golds at one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (its apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six golds and one silver.
It would be like Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint starting today and lasting three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just loved this one.
A team competition is always the best.
They win it with friends.
To be honest, winning alone.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given a knighthood."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were fastest in the time trials in a four-piece, four-kilometre team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record, which won gold at London 2012, is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time trials when officials invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trottt, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milnging's Katie Archibald advanced in world record time at 4:13:260.
The Great Britain team has learned to trust its great track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole range of medals.
After performing truly extraordinary and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been a background drama, the least of which have not been the resignation of technical director, Shane Sutton, in April for sexism and bullying charges, and the end of a competitive career of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendington.
Based on first-night races at a cycling stadium, however, it seems that Great Britain's now legendary reputation is rising to its peak at a perfect moment could hold its place once again.
Portland smelter future questionable over UK cuts power contract
The future of Portland's Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when an electricity company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant's owners is about to close the distribution deal, so a cut in all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows a decision by Victoria's administration earlier this year to keep the plant running will not be extended.
For a 20-year period, aid will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with factory closures.
Not only that, a snowball effect may be possible, as a melt-on-t melt drive of about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a smelter of Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's smelter loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of production at the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from a Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and smaller shares are owned by Chinese CITIC and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
"AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protement agreements" that were supposed to come into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects contracts to deliver on earnings by fiscal year 2017," the electricity company said.
All potential earnings impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limited by a strong outlook for wholesale electricity prices futures markets.
AGL said it had already "indicted to end" lower the value of contracts in its accounts by woe of woes of woes of woephing.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep smelting in operation or securing a molten supply of electricity."
A U.S. firm said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November of this year, but it has yet to explain why withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of both the smelting of Portland, which is located in Victoria, and also because of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of poor economic conditions in the sector.
Earlier in the week, Stephen Mikkelsen, Executive Director of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
"If both factories displace, there is a significant reduction in demand for [electricity] markets.
For us, as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Ynner clan, are on the cover of the US Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has been a model at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The file announcement was followed by an idiosyncratic (or maybe just the Kardashians style of the Kardashians) scripted reality video of the entire Kardashian-Jenner clasp (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and joined everyone's favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
This is a clichella plot of almost every "birthday" episode of almost every children's television series (Seacrest pronounces lines "I guess you thought we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-liter bunny junction), but Kris had to somehow get his girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because I'm sure we've moved to a new age for the Kardashians with the Septong spot.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the paper's September issue is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the highest-selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Freasion calculated that last year's 832-page opus 615 was advertising content).
Its cover, therefore, is expected to be so vehemently that for the past two years images of the paper have leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years, there have been more "celebrities acting as models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and ambassador to Dior, was on the cover in 2013, year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, who the magazine describes as a "success model" of her generation, hit the former category, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people, or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner has all of this).
They are justifiably talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
With Lemonade's release, Beyonce's cover model of last year, Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career.
Of course, not everyone is happy to Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be fraught.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hamble, calling them "wruck at this moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But running around in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications found behind a paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160 000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable in the population are turned away from Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for further cuts in funding to its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limit of the community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of legal centers in the Queensland community, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres calculation report, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision was not reversed, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland Community legal centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need each year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without help.
We call on the attorney general, as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis, to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government implemented its pledge to raise funding for legal aid to national average levels.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal centre and their client communities, and the Palaszzzuki board should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly failing to do anything after being told that the head of North Carolina's North Carolina operations threatened a gun with a gun as they drove in the Jeep in February.
The incident was described in an suit filed by former state campaign software drill Vincent Bordin on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he waited for months to deal with the situation internally, before realizing that "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the suit.
After selecting a local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, the suit said.
"You don't have to launch the guns to cause damage," Bordini said in the suit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger in telling the public in North Carolina that "people of another increase" - usually involving gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to pick judges.
The Trump campaign said the media has taken his word out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent control, as well as Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Hope Hicks, Trump, did not respond to a request for comment immediately.
Companies to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, local news bust company Charlote reports Phillip recently left the campaign.
His call to a consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing the whole stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For me, this was a great attraction to Heathrow, as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we saw huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics delivered huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Games, some come thinking that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be put to shame in front of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
Barriers must always be crossed, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion will be able to create up to 180,000 new jobs and ounces of ounces of ounce of ounces of ounce of ounce of ounces, and to leave the legacy of skills and employment around the airport, both around the airport.
We have a great team at Heathrow to implement an ounce of sterling ounce of ounce of ounce on time and in a budget: a T5 voted to be the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is poised to implement a third runway backed by quid with  pounds of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also.
We needed to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat-and-mouse play about advertising blocking
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ads blocking the program are "cat and mouse play," said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad inhibitors on its computer-using pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying users can update the program's filters to block ads on social network pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the code on its website is being exchanged around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the side are ads.
But now Adblock says it's gone around a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-trip battle between an open-source ad-blocking community and its circumventors has been going on since advertising blocking it was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how big a worry about advertising blockers has become to industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million use adventors, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe research. This is nearly four times the number of programs that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is following ad blockers of computer-using pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to make Facebook look worth investing in an action like this.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would daily its "advertising" tool to give people more power over how to target ads to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were troubling because they would also block some of the site's other than advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Advertisers are boring tools, which is why instead of them we are focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway apparently due to suicide
The victim lay on a freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman hit by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday, apparently a suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 road near Morges in a Vaud canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "undesirable act" and set himself down in the dark to lie down a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaudi police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, police said, pleading to them and all witnesses to the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation of this kind," lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"However, it seems to anyone involved in charge of drivers.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That will remain up to the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents for the past five years suggest drivers are not held liable.
In both cases - both of whom had a person walking in a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of manslaughter due to neglect after he hit and killed a man who lay on A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court told him.
The court found that the police officer, who was responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to be habitable once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to see if Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled air squilts, could sometimes have ground conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the top formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas of Earth drier, but once there were enough water and geographic fluctuations to enable life and to protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of 30 percent fainter sun.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side of day to the sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, as it were, protecting the surface of a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current ones.
The model produced a story of the developmental stages of Venus that was similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitual, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor fluctuated by ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, with its deadly greenhouse gas effects, Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from the actions of the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey affairs, saying it was the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Colorado executive vice president/Director General, confirmed the information and cited that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of hockey at the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey affairs must be fully aligned with the organization's vision.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach during his first Avalanche season of 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a middle division victory, but Minnesota downed Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not made a shortlist of the past two years.
The Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing a Western Conference wild-card playoff spot.
The goaltender Roy, who was selected for the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two at both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and postpone strike
Industrial action by North Sea oil workers over pay is being put off as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service company Wood Group have been held randomly with North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to resume a process aimed at resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings from early next week to take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions say their recent industrial action, which they say is their first in more than 25 years, was an objection to potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut fees for North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction results in a 10 percent reduction in its country-based contractors for 2014.
The company said further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its giant merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish MP, met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest work disputes in the North Sea of a generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for a few, in the North Sea as well as throughout the country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than tune of tune in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around nornon.
Kepler measures star rotational speed in the Pleiades Star Corps
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete listing of the stars of the Pleiades Star cluster rotation.
The new data will help astronomers understand why star cluster stars spin at varying speeds, as well as how detours are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Center, said in a press release
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd were born about 125 million years ago, and are right now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
With their peak spin rate, these growing-based stars plunge large amounts of starwinds.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake stars.
As the star gets older, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by following the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the squares, we see that slow bikers tend to be more massive, while the fastest bikers tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Clejad Star cluster provides an anchor to roll stars into theoretical models comprising both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and, so to speak, hang their 'dancial shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejades' rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
