Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to a home win in the opening game - another win for Savo Volley
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who won medals in the Men&#39;s Volleyball Championship seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
General player Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the Hurricane&#39;s most effective player with 22 points.
There were some plans to go abroad, but they didn&#39;t materialize, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
Things were settled pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who also played in Loimu, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was national team player Samuli Kaislasalo, who plays on a match-specific contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the opposite side as well, and that brought an extra extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal streak is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley&#39;s most powerful
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley&#39;s most effective with 18 points, when the team beat the Vieremä Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was fluctuating, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze out a win.
At least I didn&#39;t have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball in the 3rd series in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was in the ceiling all the time.
The home opener left a good feeling.
Miro was great, Sillik also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala&#39;s previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo, while Tuovinen was also the head coach then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks&#39; most efficient player with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league points exchange in the 2012-13 season, has started this season strong as well.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took their opening win of the season after defeating Kokkola Tiikerit 3-2.
The season has started quite well from my point of view.
Today, of course, defeat was close, because we were in the fourth set with a loss of 17-21.
We dug out a set win from somewhere, and the fifth set came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers, who were still in the finals, were the most effective chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported with 17 points.
Didn&#39;t get any hold on the guy&#39;s chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland is number one in the world when comparing human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, the education level of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is connected to economic growth.
Real Madrid&#39;s Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made some brilliant saves, and the local game between the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian goalkeeper Courtois had time to save.
Courtois played at Atletico for three seasons on loan while he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Association Fifa chose him as goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale had the best chance to score for Real, but his shot went wide at the end of the opening half.
Bale was substituted after the break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters chanted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus, during the match.
In the United States, the right to abortion is now being attacked - A powerful documentary tells why
The US Senate is currently trying to find out whether President Donald Trump&#39;s nominee Brett Kavanaugh could be chosen as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that with Kavanaugh&#39;s decisive vote, the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the US in 1973, could be overturned.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg&#39;s documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tells how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received varying degrees of support for it from the vast majority of our country&#39;s MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, we meet gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has become the only doctor performing abortions in the state of Missouri due to stricter laws.
The clinic&#39;s armed guard says he is defending religious freedom in the USA.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let&#39;s go back to when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons of the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died from an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the USA per year.
The legalization of abortion was especially defended by the Republican Party.
Back in 1967, California&#39;s abortion rights law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential election campaign of 1980, who began to mix religion with politics in a revolutionary way in order to attract voters.
His successor, George Bush senior, also changed his stance on abortion.
And so did Donald Trump.
The documentary reaches the deepest core of the matter in search of the underlying reason for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When apartheid religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of this writing, the US is in a situation where the president, who boasted about his sexual harassment but who won the votes of the religious right with his abortion stance, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can gain the power based on his Libra position to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot dead seven Palestinians, including two children - on the border of large protests
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, when Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike in the border zone after protesters pelted Israeli forces with rocks and explosives.
The army says it has started using force to ensure that the protesters do not break the border fence or go to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, there are 12,000 wounded.
Demonstrators demand that Palestinian families be allowed access to areas that Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balloons sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - couldn&#39;t shoot himself
Wigan top scorer Chey Dunkley appeared to bring him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed play to continue.
According to his interpretation, Taklaus was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
The situation seemed to bother referee Ward, who awarded Norwich a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 winning goal.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The former was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
Puki liked working again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created scoring chances and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
He has a five-game winning streak behind him.
The Pedophile Help Desk was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, approximately 40,000 feel an interest in children
According to the estimate, two percent of men and a small part of women feel at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpo, which offers counseling and therapy, began to receive a flood of e-mails and appointment times were booked up very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the fall.
A sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
The majority of those who notice pedophilic feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and therefore have not done anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that oppress and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says sex therapist Patricia Thesleff to Yelle, who works as a special expert in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but based on betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background is Trump&#39;s role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
Based on the odds, the biggest favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to strive for a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is remarkable, because even last year the gaps were frozen.
Still, rewarding Kim, who has spent years with nuclear weapons and leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The recipients of the Nobel prizes will be announced from Monday, and on Friday it will be the turn of the one that gets the most attention, the peace prize.
If the award is not given to those who participated in the diplomacy of the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a karmic byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has said that this year there are 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself wouldn&#39;t mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a win for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
However, there are factors that make Trump&#39;s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 2000s, the award has been given to three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would therefore require a complete ideological change from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like slobs and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that happened on Ykkösti in Lohja happened on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system error, the fire department tried to restore traffic to normal.
However, it didn&#39;t work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the National Road Traffic Center said that it cannot be opened because there are motorists on the road all the time and they drive as hard as they can, the on-duty fire marshal Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction only after waiting for a while.
When the first one starts acting against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, Liikenneturva&#39;s contact manager Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, you may not stop on highways and tunnels except for a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva reminds us that in exceptional situations you cannot endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always allow as unhindered passage as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the highway is especially prohibited, as well as making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where you must also always turn on your headlights.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the Lumia from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question, says Heiskanen in Liikenneturva&#39;s press release.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration, even though the ship got stuck at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported to Tampere by the inland water ship M/S would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the bow of the ship was stuck in the lake bed, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its course late on Saturday evening and got stuck on the bottom of the bow in Vanajavedi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the crash.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them on the fire department to the harbor and home by bus, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with Ilves winning 4-3.
According to Syrjä, Saturday&#39;s Haveri was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavedi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway marker was covered with log droppings, which is why its reflectors could not be seen normally in the dark autumn evening.
No major collision
The accident happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had undercut the highway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no major drama involved in the incident, as the ship&#39;s speed at the time of the incident was very low and hitting the bottom did not cause a significant collision.
According to Syrjæ, getting caught on the bottom has not caused any leaks or dents in the ship and it seems that the ship&#39;s cruises will continue as normal.
A diver visited on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship was towed away from the shallows.
Just to be sure, we will go to the shipyard again to check that this did not cause any damage, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere&#39;s next cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the ship&#39;s cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service was alerted to the incident on Saturday evening a little after half past twelve.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but the ambulances were of no use.
Matti Willman, the on-duty fire marshal, said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service announced after half past three on the night before Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Accused of harassment and drunkenness, Trump&#39;s judicial nominee may be deprived of the top post
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to be a judge of the US Supreme Court, may well miss out on the position he is aiming for, says program director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their student days.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up nominating someone else for the position.
In the United States, it has occasionally happened in the past that the president&#39;s nominee for Supreme Court justice has caused a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to save face.
The nomination would fall into the hands of the Democrats
The US Supreme Court strives to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the selection of a new justice has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision will likely fall on the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional midterm elections.
It would increase voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not fall every presidential term, as the judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at around 70-80 years of age.
Even some of the Republicans are hesitant about the appointment
A background check is normally done on the candidates for judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, Aaltola states.
Although Trump has set a deadline of only one week for the FBI&#39;s further investigation, according to Aaltola, it can still bring up something relevant.
Yes it might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh&#39;s suitability or unsuitability for office will still be discussed vigorously before the senate makes its decision.
Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are believed to be skeptical of Kavanaugh&#39;s appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination were put to a vote and the Republicans lost.
A woman identified the Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes the Russian man suspected of poisoning in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photos, the woman said that it was Anatoli Tshepiga, who works for military intelligence in the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier that they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Tshepiga.
Even earlier, they said they found evidence that the men&#39;s current identities are cover identities.
The BBC team traveled to the Far East, near the Russian-Chinese border, to the village where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the young Tshepiga from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from British police photos of a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said earlier in September in an interview they gave to Russian TV that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
The elderly as throwaway bags in social security reform
Now we have a living example of what the change limiter of social security reform defined by the Sipilä government means in practice.
My hometown Vaala&#39;s health services are produced by the Oulunkaari municipal corporation, whose health services director was the former regional director of Attendo, who was elected in 2016.
The leaders of the municipal association warn the council about the change limiter.
If the health and social care expenses rise now, the municipality&#39;s state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were startled, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of elderly care, which would put an end to the inpatient care of the health center&#39;s bed ward and the small unit for people with dementia.
Home medical care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages with long distances in Vaala will be uprooted to be cared for &quot;at home&quot; next to the health center.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
Vaala&#39;s left party did not swallow the bad preparation, but organized a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, caregivers and also representatives of other parties.
I presented with the slides of the provincial health and social care preparation, how in the municipality of Vaala, the elderly are already cared for at home the most in all of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, councilor of the neighboring municipality, was also present.
The local paper made a big story about the occasion, and it again put the Oulunkaari preparers on their back legs.
Sote preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now empty waiting for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The drafters only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it provides or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will have to care for the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the inpatient places at the health center will be discontinued because there is no doctor on call at night.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors of the Vaala Health Center.
Vaala&#39;s example shows how central government officials manipulate the councilors with insufficient information and the councilors are pushed against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the center party will empty the residents of Vaala, because who will stay there voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was one of the center&#39;s election slogans that the whole country be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a grand mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when the visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Reinjoki since morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read the protesters&#39; signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
Several protests have been organized during Erdogan&#39;s visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, around 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had cordoned off a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised that his visit to Germany had been successful and estimated that it had strengthened the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild the two countries&#39; relations, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey&#39;s 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel emphasized that there are deep disagreements between the countries, for example, regarding human rights issues.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Armin Laschet canceled their participation in the opening as criticism of Erdogan&#39;s visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subdued.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last leg of Erdogan&#39;s trip to Germany, a significant part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three are charged with murdering a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people are charged with the February murder of Kuciak and her fiance, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot to death with his fiancee in their home in Bratislava in February.
He had investigated the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders are related to Kuciak&#39;s investigations.
The case and Kuciak&#39;s published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing error, Sunday&#39;s Karjalainen also has to be mailed without an address.
This may be seen in the distribution of the newspaper in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to common boxes has to be done from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday&#39;s paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post office sends extra bundles of leaves to the province.
Magazines for subscribers in the rest of Finland will be mailed separately only on Monday, with stickers.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews Vesa Heilala, among others, live today in his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio talking about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, for which a bank loan was needed.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed every year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight that happened in 2014 and claimed a fatality, things are on the mend.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa&#39;s flight number is 300, which means that his trip takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and you are weightless for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut says about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also describes his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic magazine called Avaruusmatka and saw the Star Trek series on television.
I&#39;ve seen Star Wars and that&#39;s why the idea was left burning...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City were a rude host
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League when they beat Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The guarantors of the reigning champion team&#39;s sixth win of the season are goalscorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth strike of the season from close range into an empty net when Leroy Sané found him at the back post of Brighton&#39;s goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero took his own goal tally to five when he saw the Brighton defense to pieces with Sterling in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentinian was able to score the 2-0 final score easily from the penalty spot.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, leads the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who have played one less game, are only one point away.
On Saturday evening, Liverpool will face third-placed Chelsea in their seventh round match.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting that ended on Sunday, Finnish Youth Associations elected new decision-makers for the next three-year term for the years 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as vice-chairman.
40 regular members and 40 alternate members of the council were elected, the Youth Associations of Finland informs on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Association Meeting held in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational goals: We will keep the doors open for everyone, and we will organize equal hobby activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, the Youth Associations of Finland says in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: &quot;Losing a very important driver&quot;
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu&#39;s British driver was asked if he believes that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari would help Hamilton in the final season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari&#39;s second driver Sebastian Vettel in World Championship points by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue with the team next season, and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would be moving to Sauber.
Naturally, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would throw his gloves on the counter.
I don&#39;t think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don&#39;t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula 1, I played F1 on PlayStation every day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,&quot; Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian race.
Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will start the race starting at 2 p.m. from the pole position.
Iltalehti follows the race moment by moment.
The championship fight for the championship of the A-youth SM series became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The highest league level for boys football ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the round that started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship fight were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically only a point away from Vasa IFK for first place.
In order for the situation to turn around in the last round, Ilves, who are second in the championship fight, must win PK-35 and hope for a defeat by Lahti.
However, the Lahti team&#39;s championship was practically confirmed even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player from Vaasa, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the people of Lahti were leading 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players from Vaasa is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A youth championship series, i.e. the P20 series, and the men&#39;s Kakkonen C group.
Vasa IFK has played against relegation practically the entire season in Kakkones.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK must beat JBK in an away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue service, luck was involved
A passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof on Juttuvaarantie in Eno around 9 o&#39;clock on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue service informs.
Luck was involved, the release states.

Serena Williams shocks with a video in which she sings topless - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is shaking again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness about breast cancer by publishing a video on her Instagram account in which she sings with only her hands in front of her breasts, reports news agency AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian band The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
&quot;I played The Divinyls&#39; global hit to remind women to do regular [breast] self-exams,&quot; Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic affects all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything - it saves many lives.
The Divinyls&#39; song is co-written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
&quot;She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first,&quot; says Williams.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams withdrew from the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
In the background is the commotion at the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams got angry with the referee of the match and, among other things, claimed that much more violent behavior is accepted from men than from female players.
A Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not suitable for people afraid of heights
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves wonderful scenery.
An extraordinary restaurant has opened in China&#39;s Zhejiang province.
It is literally perched on a ledge of rock.
From there you can look at the forest spreading below if you want.
The rugged scenery in the heights makes the restaurant visitors gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to hike through the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on September 19, 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant&#39;s toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good basic fitness, the local reports.
Korpela&#39;s alley run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things come to an end.
Today, that&#39;s what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela&#39;s alley run, which has been quite popular.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the first episode on television.
The top numbers in themselves no longer have any practical meaning, because there is no continuation of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen&#39;s series.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku&#39;s relationship takes another leap forward, and Jaska&#39;s mother seems to be the first to guess what is to come.
The relationship between Anss and Miisa is also warm, downright romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho appears in the picture once again.
Even the police are suspicious of the man.
Still, no one can predict Laiho&#39;s fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, hears incredible news.
Kauko&#39;s last will is revealed, which brings the woman to the verge of tears.
After a week, Sorjonen will continue with new episodes on Sunday evenings.
Korpela&#39;s alley run today on TV1 at 21:05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season is in full swing.
Many are betting on whether to stay at home or not.
However, the working mole should think about whether it is worth going to infect others, because the disease can be contagious, even if the own symptoms are minor.
Sometimes flu symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they appear slowly.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem minor, says the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is already contagious a day before the symptoms start and from five days to a week thereafter.
Children may catch the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or work.
You can return to work when the cough subsides and there is no more fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Exercising should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too quickly slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, use a tissue and throw the snot paper in the trash.
Aching to get going, though?
If you have to leave home when you are sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the wearer aware of the head area.
Then you shouldn&#39;t put your fingers in your nose or mouth, says Poland.
Sneezing is also limited with the mask.
How could infections be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, the average person in the United States touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, warns Poland.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: &quot;My husband is a hockey player&quot;
Hockey players and misses are often associated with each other.
This also happened to Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has received the 2018 Miss Finland crown.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15 years old.
Alina&#39;s mother is Inger-Finnish and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school because of her father&#39;s Russianness.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
I didn&#39;t have any friends in Pertunmaa at all, Alina says at the Miss Finland semi-finalist announcement ceremony.
After middle school, Alina decided to start with a clean slate and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the beauty pageant found new friends and everyday life started to go smoothly.
When you&#39;re 15 years old, you think you&#39;re an adult, but in retrospect, I really wasn&#39;t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans ranks.
After his SM league career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a long-distance relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to make it to the winning trio and with that I would have a career, I don&#39;t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live apart, our trust works well, and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays alive all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing in continued growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the Earth.
Still, you don&#39;t want to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of moderation runs into big problems.
In a few generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-continued exceeding of the earth&#39;s carrying capacity and climate change make the stone base of this market economy shake threateningly.
Two men were stabbed the night before Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitrator at four in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and another, born in 1968, was injured less.
The older man has already been released from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter&#39;s coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn&#39;s Simon Silverholt&#39;s equalizer against Inter earned the team an important point in the men&#39;s football league on Saturday.
Silverholt completed the equalizer in the 78th minute of the match, which ended in a 1-1 score.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the away game, the people of Mariehamn narrowed the gap to the Turku Palloseura, the league qualifier, to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn&#39;s head coach Peter Lundberg.
However, Lundberg noted that the team didn&#39;t put up the fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but fortunately the Turku team&#39;s goal brought us into the game stronger.
According to the head coach of the home team Inter, John Allen, the game was under control, but scoring again brought pain.
One defensive error took the full point pot away from us, Allen lamented.
We were the best again!

Lehterä showed his underpowered skills, the playing spot is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä&#39;s strong understrength play came to the fore when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä assisted Michael Raffli twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been exposed due to drug suspicions.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug ring, in which some are suspected of drug use and some of, for example, sales.
Lehterä has denied that he committed the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Philadelphia Inquirer journalist Sam Carchidi, who follows the Flyers closely, estimated after the match that Lehterä belongs to a group of six forwards, five of whom will get a place in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second period, Lehterä fought for the puck underpowered, pulled the defender on him and passed to Raffli, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open spot.
For the second time, the duo&#39;s cooperation brought a goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team&#39;s coaching management to decide whether he will join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of that.
Now the coaches will decide if I can play.
I believe I&#39;m ready for the NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston&#39;s Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who learned puck at Jokipoj, played 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
In Boston&#39;s goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered Four times and made 20 saves.
Defender Vili Saarijärvi, who has a Kärpät background, scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit with superiority, when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary&#39;s ranks, Ilves was brought up, defender Juuso Välimäki got an assist, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested, among others, Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Florida&#39;s Aleksander Barkov played more than 20 minutes and scored a goal in the local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara scored his team&#39;s consolation goal midway through the final period as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the losers&#39; goal, Joonas Korpisalo blocked 23/27 pucks.
Already more than 180,000 answers to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the survey concerning the decision about the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time in the future has already collected more than 180,000 answers.
The questionnaire opened on the Otakantaa.fi service will have time to answer in just under a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked their opinion on whether Finland should be at the same time as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent picture shows the change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of kilos
Eddie Hall, who was crowned the world&#39;s strongest man in 2017, is going through a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the world&#39;s strongest man for a long time and determinedly.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed 200 kilos at his biggest, according to the Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body was not designed to be this size, Hall said.
The Brit was hunting for the victory of the world&#39;s strongest man contest by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn&#39;t want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World&#39;s Strongest Man competition held in April.
Recently, Hall published a photo on Instagram, in which he poses in a significantly slimmer shape than his active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he now works out five times a week aerobically.
The program includes, among other things, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, Icelander Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the Game of Thrones TV series, became the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - &quot;Firmly caught on a rock&quot;
The inland vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday evening in Lake Pyhäjärvi in Aka.
The rescue service received an alert about a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past twelve.
The 30-meter vessel M/S Tampere has drifted aground, and is firmly attached to its bow with rocks, described Matti Willman, fire master on duty.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue service, personal injuries were avoided.
The passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland away from the ship.
Now they will be transferred by bus towards Tampere, Jari Nieminen, the manager on duty, told STT after one o&#39;clock in the morning.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive the evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off course on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are investigating the cause of the events.
Matti Willman, the on-duty fire marshal, said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather strong wind.
According to the rescue service, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently the ship isn&#39;t leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check what the situation is at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland water vessel operating as a restaurant ship, with a maximum allowed number of passengers of 180 people.
The ship also has a meeting room that can be rented for private use.
According to the ship&#39;s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius&#39; tonight&#39;s match against Erkan Teperi is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reports today about the subpoena petition filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged with late payment interest for a total of well over 80,000 euros in unpaid manager&#39;s fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila tells Ilta-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, Helenius&#39; current manager, sent a response to Iltalehte, which tells the boxer&#39;s view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised that they would be able to organize matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius is only obliged to pay a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, just receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Paid work has never been agreed upon and such a thing would also have been absurd in Helenius&#39; situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the counterpart, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income sharing in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman only got the draft done at the end of 2014.
On his part, he found the proposal to be bad and broke off the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought when he was dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an &quot;individual but large&quot; bill for the Manager&#39;s work.
A lawsuit has been filed this year with the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen&#39;s and Kokkila&#39;s subsequent actions to be sleazy, the response states.
Today, Helenius will face Erkan Teperi, who is ranked seventh in the IBF heavyweight challenger list, in Stuttgart.
A warm-hearted man and a good journalist
Entertainer and music producer Ilkka &quot;Ile&quot; Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
Long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The host&#39;s death notice was published in Sunday&#39;s Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement states that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli told about his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio at the time, who was saddened by the news of his acquaintance&#39;s fate.
He left Facebook earlier, as if saying goodbye, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a well-liked person with quick wits and funny stories.
I got to know Erk already as a little boy, when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
That&#39;s when we met Erki.
He was Finnlevy&#39;s spokesperson at the time and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard reporter at all the parties doing stories about the artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how much he loved entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a warm-hearted man and a good reporter.
He became known to many as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki also interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a journalist at the Fazer record company with Toivo Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir&#39;s records.
However, Pälli&#39;s greatest passion was radio work, where he had his own unique style.
He has been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners on Yle&#39;s airwaves.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the association&#39;s fiscal year ended in May showed a profit of around 450,000 euros.
The union describes its financial situation as having experienced a &quot;full turnaround&quot;, although the economy is of course burdened by &quot;a significant debt on the balance sheet&quot;.
CEO Mika Kulmala praises the quick response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last fall as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has permeated our entire organization, Kulmala says in the press release.
We have also been very successful in acquiring partners, and in addition, the income from the World Cups was maximum in the last competition season.
However, also in the future, cost management must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors are gathered to assess their injuries and need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of those who moved around the hospital area was 52-year-old Baharuddin from Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has injuries to his back and arm, was lying in the yard of the army hospital in Palu.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the earthquake started.
The family had been invited to Palu&#39;s wedding party.
I was probably crushed under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don&#39;t know what has happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris told the AP news agency, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed
At the evacuation center in Palu, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many residents of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the household is somehow standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it for good and bury the residents underneath.
According to the AP news agency, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly around 560 prisoners, so there are possibly around 300 escapees.
Some of the inmates of Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the inmates became enraged and set fire to the prison after the guards had forbidden them to go in search of their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 transport plane, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
The pilots have to land on the field without the help of air traffic control, because the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, a long area of rain will spread over the entire country from the west, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain mostly comes as water, but sleet or snow can be expected in central and northern Lapland.
The freezing temperatures of the previous night are not happening again, because the temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures in check quite effectively.
Even in the west, you can temporarily go below freezing, said the on-duty meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will move eastward during the morning.
It is cloudy or partly cloudy in the south and west.
In the afternoon, the temperatures move up to the height of Oulu in steps of 10-13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in effect in sea areas.
Actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but other than that, typical autumn weather is expected.
Yes, that autumn is really starting to kick in now, Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final will not be seen on television
On IL-TV you can follow the glamor and excitement of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti&#39;s entertainment editors broadcast live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from Billnäs ruuk.
The broadcast starts around 18:50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will take place at the Billnäs ironworks in Raasepor.
Before the start of the final, you can follow the atmosphere from the venue on IL-TV&#39;s live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts around 18:30 and continues for about an hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented in the jury by 1998 Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kaupa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped she would get to college before going to the pageant
The Russian father Dimitri and the Inger mother Svetlana believed in their daughter&#39;s success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, the parents of the recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, proudly watched their daughter&#39;s first moments wearing the crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
It&#39;s a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika the whole time, but half an hour before the result we started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than the Miss career.
Alina was often told that since she is so pretty, she should start being a miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents&#39; wish was for Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That&#39;s how it happened, and in the end Alina still wanted to get her bachelor&#39;s degree before the pageants.
We already asked last year why he doesn&#39;t participate, but he wanted to finish the job.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina&#39;s boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey for work in Japan, and could not come to Finland to support his beloved in the final.
Alina&#39;s parents believe that the young people&#39;s relationship will last a gap year.
Yes, it&#39;s meant to be!
The parents hoped that the daughter would have time to visit soon.
There has been such a long break in visits because of the misses.
I miss you already, even though there have been messages.
A young man died in a speeding accident in Lahti - the police arrested three people
According to the police, three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentionality of the overtaking, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the arrested persons and the man who died in the run-over knew each other from the past.
More information about the case will be available at the beginning of next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a cartoon came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
Luomuhömppä once came from my husband&#39;s statement, where he suggested it as a character for the story I was developing, says Espoo-based comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was in Brussels doing financial and legal matters as an EU translator until ten years ago, after the fourth child, the family became a return emigrant.
I&#39;ve had a great time as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what would I do when I grew up, when even the smallest child was already growing up.
Then in 2014, a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
The last time I drew was as a child, but when these Luomuhömpa manuscripts started to appear then, the situation changed.
At first, I made several dozens of manuscripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled draftsman, but I couldn&#39;t get her involved until the summer of 2016, when I gifted Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great encouragement to him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn&#39;t even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop into my mind constantly, but I usually don&#39;t finish them all at once.
One three-frame strip takes up to several hours.
I might do one frame at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest because drawing is not my strong point.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates contemporary newspaper cartoons such as Scott Adams&#39; Dilbert.
The characters of Loumuhömpa are a mother with a carrot body and a head of salad hair, who was inspired by the L theme.
The other people are Man, Pissis and Gemini.
In the world of organic food, a person is what he eats.
The ideas for the series come from my own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn&#39;t want to preach or offer forced buns, even though Luomuhömppään occasionally touches on the matter.
Piippo says that she reads her series with her husband and children.
After all, it&#39;s such a great feeling when you look at a cartoon you&#39;ve drawn and realize that this is what I did today.
And there are enough challenges for housewives!

Lotto&#39;s million jackpot remained inflated - these were the right numbers
No full matches were found in round 39/2018 in Lotto.
The biggest wins of the evening were seen in Lauantai-Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, Lotto&#39;s pot will be 3.6 million euros.
Saturday Joker found two 6 correct results.
Another prize of 20,000 euros goes to the winner who played with a Veikkaus card at S-Market Tikkurila in Vantaa.
The second one was caught by an online player from Vaasa.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn&#39;t leave the cracked tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he was able to escort the passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely away from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The teenager was on duty at the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to steer the Batik Air airliner off the runway and into the air.
In this way, he could thus save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower rattled and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be airlifted to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation authority representative told The Jakarta Post.
The tremor continued to intensify after the flight took off, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority has paid tribute to Agung&#39;s heroism on social media.
Rehn reflected on Yelle about Europe ending up in a trade war: &quot;You have to look at the next tweet&quot;
The trade war between the US and China is reflected in the entire global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
CEO Olli Rehn said on Yle&#39;s first morning that although the growing tension does not have direct effects on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies&#39; investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the exports of Finnish companies.
In Rehn&#39;s opinion, Europe is so far in good shape.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and helped calm the situation with China and Japan as well.
In Rehn&#39;s opinion, Europe does not seem to be grinding under the feet of a trade war.
Have to watch the next tweet and judge after that.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted violently to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year&#39;s deficit will be more than 2.4 percent of the national product.
Rehn considers the situation in Italy to be worrying.
Five percent of the country&#39;s loan portfolio is problem loans and unorganized loans are more than ten percent.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak state and the country seems to once again exceed its commitments in relation to its European partners.
Maybe it&#39;s not worth painting new crises yet, Rehn answered when he was asked if Italy will lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue affecting Europe is Britain&#39;s departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it was okay.
A contested divorce would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as CEO of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down from his position after just over a year.
The discussion about his successor has started.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in the speeches.
It probably doesn&#39;t hurt if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on the matter beyond this.
HS&#39;s super popular Black box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box shows organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again next week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theater on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the black box will visit the Tampere theater for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theater on sale.
The show in Tampere is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and cameramen appearing on stage will tell a true story they have been preparing for a long time, which has not been published in any HS medium before.
There is again something that no one at Takuu has ever heard.
&quot;There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a telling story about a very current health issue,&quot; says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of Black Box.
After the show, the audience has the opportunity to meet the editors and cameramen of HS and continue the conversation.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the auditorium.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as journalistic act of the year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the journalists&#39; desire to get close to their readers.
The spring season 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theater in March-April.
The show also visits Tampere and Turku.
The show you can see at that time has a different content than this autumn&#39;s evenings.
A lost mushroom picker was found thanks to an &quot;unprejudiced experiment&quot;.
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is the best in the world: &quot;We are asked about training&quot;
According to the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drones in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a couple of minutes.
The rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that &quot;with the help of open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are at the top of the world here as well&quot;.
Drones are quite a new concept and even newer in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are masters of using drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard to get visitors to watch the Finnish police&#39;s drone activity.
We are asked about trainings.
Getting even more common
Himberg reminds that in Finland&#39;s winter conditions, finding a lost person as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police has already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are supposed to be trained more.
Drones are already used a lot in police tasks, and their use will become more common and increase in the future.
I would dare to say so, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, you already have to check an area a little further away, where it is possible to fear that violence will be encountered there.
The drone can then be used for preliminary reconnaissance.
Karelia Rugby rose to the top spot
Karelia Rugby celebrated the 2nd division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The people of Joensuu were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second period and defeated the visitors from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship gave Karjala Rugby a historic promotion to the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-division 1 division.
The club plans to accept a place in the series, but it knows quite a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of barely twenty players must be increased to 25.
The 1st division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, who play in the NHL, confirmed on the club&#39;s Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked super promise Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer booking event.
The forward joined Montreal&#39;s practice squad at the end of the summer and has shown strong performances in training matches in September.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big development steps after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL&#39;s regular season starts on the night before Thursday of next week Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader like?
This week in Finland, there has been a lot of talk about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Nokia&#39;s board chairman Risto Siilasmaa talked about his book Paranoidi optimisti, in which he sheds light on his management philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the management of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also spoken about the managers&#39; inability to work as a team; of fear and silence, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking ability and agility of the company&#39;s rise phase disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, was also organized in Helsinki during the week, which attracted the cream of Finnish business life to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world took to the stage.
Enough talk about good management.
Management legend Gary Hamel said that a good manager must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods store chain, known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must know how to communicate the company&#39;s purpose to the entire staff.
And that purpose cannot only be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a successful book about introverts, said that the most successful leaders have been researched to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Professor of finance Aswath Damodaran reminded that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the phase of the company&#39;s life cycle.
In the company&#39;s early stages, the manager must know how to tell the story on which the company&#39;s future is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish managers - listened to these teachings at the Nordic Business Forum.
They were at risk of an information explosion.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That&#39;s why management so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also there.
They chatted with each other backstage in a friendly manner.
However, they hardly considered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to assess.
Sara Chafak arrived stunning on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the miss finale in a stunning black dress.
The spectacular dress of the 2012 Miss Finland also had a lace skirt.
I have a bit of jet lag.
I came from Los Angeles again.
By far I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells his news.
Chafak says that he goes to Los for auditions.
He has done, among other things, advertising shoots.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to the one in Finland.
However, according to him, the work has to be done even harder, because a replacement can always be easily found for the model&#39;s work.
We have to push harder and be aggressive, says Chafak.
A 30,000 euro live art prize in Kuopio for choreographer Sonya Lindfors
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural award worth 30,000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Recipient of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors&#39; art is vital to its immediate environment.
His works give others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have been lacking before, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The award is given annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the wanted Volvo in a major operation: &quot;We can&#39;t say from where&quot;
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Juutinrauma and Ison-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själland to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark was closed.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS caught up with the shift manager of the media center of the Copenhagen police.
The car you were looking for has been found.
We cannot yet tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm tells Ilta-Sanom about the information from the Copenhagen police.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat, according to the police.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Denmark&#39;s Ekstra Bladet reported on Saturday&#39;s police press conference.
The head of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was tight-lipped about the course of the operation.
He did not want to say under which crime the matter is being investigated.
However, Skov said that it is a &quot;serious crime&quot;.
It was a threat to people&#39;s lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police will not say whether they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
STT says that according to the police, however, the general public no longer has reason to worry, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia&#39;s name has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote on the issue in disputed elections
Macedonia, located in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would become the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia&#39;s efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks if the voter supports Macedonia&#39;s EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
Voting started smoothly, at least at the school located in the center of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum means change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been used in official contexts under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev&#39;s government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough to worry about whether the voter turnout will rise above the required 50 percent.
The referendum is not binding, but a victory of yes votes would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of the parliament is required to amend the constitution.
The Greek parliament also has yet to approve the deal.
The polling stations close at 8 pm Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teperi
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teperi in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late on Saturday night.
The 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner of that may have the opportunity to compete in tougher tasks than the one seen on Saturday, which have considerable financial importance.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand strike.
Teper could no longer get up from the floor.
&quot;Nordic Nightmare&quot; hurt his opponent already in the third round, when the German&#39;s nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to meet already in December 2015.
That&#39;s when Teper pleaded injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had failed a doping test twice.
Helenius has won 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went into the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton won by team order - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula 1 championship title came close to being secured again, as Mercedes&#39; Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and extended his World Championship points lead over Ferrari&#39;s Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started the race from the pole position, finished second.
Bottas, who took the opening win of his career in Sochi last year, held the top spot until the halfway point of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari&#39;s Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull&#39;s Max Verstappen, who started from the last row, was fifth.
The two assaulted a man from Juuka in Joensuu - they were caught a block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old man from Juuka at Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim&#39;s phone, among other things.
The police caught up with the suspects, a 35-year-old man from Häinaveti and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, the police say.
The victim suffered contusion injuries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
The CEO of the electric car company Tesla, Elon Musk, is leaving his position as chairman of the company&#39;s board.
Musk has agreed on the matter with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets, according to which he would have secured financing to pull Tesla off the stock market.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company must also pay a fine of 20 million euros if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is racing against time to reach an agreement on Nafta with the US
Time is running out in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set Sunday as the deadline, and the countries&#39; negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada&#39;s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to fully focus on trade negotiations.
At President Donald Trump&#39;s insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement, Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to implement the agreement before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada&#39;s participation in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that the plan is to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these schedules, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada would have to be ready by Sunday to give the US Congress enough time to evaluate it.
The neighbor mistook the burning of the candles for a fire in Kaakkur - the fire department was called to the scene
Burnt candles in an apartment building in Oulu&#39;s Kaakkuri caused a fire alarm the night before Sunday.
A dozen units of the rescue service were called to the scene due to a possible apartment building fire.
At the scene, it was discovered that the burnt candles in the sauna of the apartment block had looked like a fire to the house opposite, which is why the emergency center had been notified.
There was no fire at the site.
The police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawls on the field and at the metro station
The police arrested eleven people after the men&#39;s football league Honka-HJK match played in Espoo on Saturday, West Uusimaa Police Department&#39;s crime commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disorder.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Ilta-Sanomat previously reported on the arrests.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large group of spectators rushed onto the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to shoving and fist fights between the teams&#39; supporters.
Mounted police were needed to end the situation, among other things.
In addition to the field, scuffles took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn&#39;t there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the brawl that took place on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Pöytäkivi won his butterfly SE time at the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the swimming World Cup 3/7 competitions in Holland.
The races are swum in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS&#39;s Pöytäkivi broke his Finnish record in the 50-meter butterfly, where he was second in the heats with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swam in Helsinki with a SE time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen representing Cetu from Espoo was 24th in butterfly with a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin&#39;s Laukkanen was sixth in the heats of the 50-meter breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the preliminaries of the two hundred meter medley, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2:14.25.
Students act out a rare treat: an ancient tragedy - the reduced Oresteia impresses with its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, the last time the ancient tragedy, Sophocles&#39; Philoctetes, was seen in the National Theater was in 1988.
Now Teatterikorkeakoulu brought Aeschylus&#39;s Oresteia, the only complete play trilogy from antiquity, on a tour starting at the National Theater.
Started in 2015 Stages open! -projects, the acting students of Teatterikorkeakoulu work together with a professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, like the first, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha&#39;s arrangement of the Oresteia condenses the story of the end of the blood feud of the condemned Atreus&#39; family and the birth of the rule of law into an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choral parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuure&#39;s fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and a presentation that reveals the sides of the theater space emphasize the reduced and clear stage thinking.
At its center is the dynamic between the performers who alternately leave the chorus, playing title roles, and the chorus.
Both double and triple interpretations of the title roles are used in the show.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and the murders of his captured Kassandra are also shown on stage, unlike in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation faithful to the text is created before the viewer&#39;s eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in getting the acting students of the Master&#39;s stage to come out as a close-knit group, literally as one organism, a rhythmic crowd.
The Actors, who bend flexibly to very expressive, sculptural group formations, especially in the chorus parts, come into their own on a bare stage, decorated only by a white curtain.
Impressive.
The performance tour of Oresteia continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theaters.
The Korean manufacturer produces its first hydrogen truck
The novelty is beginning to be seen in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement signed with Hyindai and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the IAA commercial vehicle exhibition in Hanover, Hyundai will deliver a new model in a batch of one thousand cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing a fuel cell-powered truck to the market, Hyundai continues on the path indicated by the Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first-of-its-kind project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refueling network, Hyundai Motor&#39;s Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the agreement.
Fists were thrown several times in Kajaani
A man in his thirties assaulted three men in and in front of a restaurant in the center of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first punched a man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the abuser hit him again.
The police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened to beat and kill the police.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three counts of assault and as violent resistance to an official.
In the center of Kajaani, Välikatu, there was also another case of assault on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old man from Kajaani hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators managed to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to the incident to contact the Kajaani police by phone at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tuktinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Longtime radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle&#39;s longtime journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he told about on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going now.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of the store&#39;s aunties and Setie must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a magazine story in 1984.
When there is a topic of interest in these annual rings, it is usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also talked to Erika Kähärä, a work environment expert from the Service Industry Trade Union (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although of course employers claim otherwise.
Only cases perceived as clearly serious come to the attention of the police, and many real situations of violence go unreported.
&quot;Companies are of course obliged to keep statistics on their near-miss situations based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their information is not collected anywhere,&quot; he said.
Mental injuries don&#39;t end up in statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they don&#39;t always result in physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to draw, when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even if the actual act doesn&#39;t happen.
Some residential areas are troubled.
The store has acquired security guards.
When the opening hours of shops were freed up, there was quite a lot of hype in the media about its effects on the safety of sellers.
&quot;At that time, quite a lot of employers organized security guards at least for the night hours and to prevent working alone,&quot; Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, a false conclusion is drawn.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, due to the guard, the disturbances remained well under control, an image arose that the guard was unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a crime involving the owner, and it is quite understandable that a shopkeeper who has been assaulted does not want to request an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
But under a subsection of the same law enacted in 2011, minor assault becomes prosecutable if it occurs in the workplace.
I think precedents are needed now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should charge.
If the court would put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there on the hard end of the punishment scale, then habits would be cleaned up.
A society where Ruokakaupa has to be open 24/7 even in small towns must guarantee the safety of the store&#39;s employees.
Heidi Sohlberg acknowledged the miss before the start of the live broadcast - &quot;Sara, Iiro is then married&quot;
This year, Miss&#39;s coronation will not be seen on TV in the traditional way, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, the host of Viasat and Viaplay&#39;s NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and red carpet host is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio of presenters told the invited guests and media representatives who had arrived there about the course of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a standing ovation.
Now all the ladies scream!
Now look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg beamed at his colleague as the audience cheered.
Many Miss Suomi from previous years are watching the competitions from the front row.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one of the directions.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg paused, looking towards Saroi.
Most likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although he looked confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his separation for the first time in Ilta-Sanomi&#39;s weekend newspaper.
Miss Kaunotar said that she does not want to reveal the reasons for the breakup in more detail in public, because it is a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he is in no rush to get into a new relationship, but is going to focus on himself.
I&#39;m focusing on my own things and especially starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula&#39;s marital status came to light at an even later stage, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The three presenters laughed at the joke.
Iirohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi cleared the mistake.
A man from Ostrobothnia tortured his bound common-law partner by cutting, burning and feeding her strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his common-law partner.
Among other things, a belt, cable and cable ties were used as the means of committing the crime.
The court ruled that the objects in question had been forfeited to the state.
Rank&#39;s indictment concerned the suspect of aggravated rape.
However, the district court rejected this charge.
Kokkolainen was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of damage.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24 last year.
At the end of the last acts, the man was caught and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the district court of Ostrobothnia gave its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
There is no evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape that occurred on May 22.
However, the court dismissed these charges as unproven.
The case was discussed in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public explanation of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked him with tobacco, fed him strong sauce and poured water and coffee on him.
In its verdict, the court ordered the state to forfeit the crime tools: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife and rasp.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the sentence that a large part of the most egregious acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay his victim a total of 5,800 euros in compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary inconvenience.
He hardly has the money in question, because the convicted person already has old debts to collect.
The prison sentence is not the man&#39;s first.
Iltalehti does not reveal the name of the convict to protect the victim&#39;s privacy.
At the time of writing, the recent district court judgment is not legally binding.
Europe leads by four points going into the Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their lead in a traditional hole-in-one match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with 10-6 points, with twelve singles matches still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four fourball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles the wins were tied 2-2.
Europe&#39;s leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played as a pair on Friday and Saturday.
Previously, no European couple had achieved something similar.
On Sunday, the duo will aim for more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and only three Americans have done it either: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent disturbance of its supporters in the Honka match: &quot;Violence does not belong in football&quot;
Football betting league team HJK published a press release on Sunday in which it condemns the disruptive behavior of its supporters in Saturday&#39;s FC Honka match in Tapiola.
&quot;We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,&quot; the announcement states.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters rushed onto the field and some seemed to be trying to start a fight with Honga&#39;s supporters.
A fight also broke out between supporters.
The orderlies could not calm down the situation, but the police and mounted police were needed.
HJK says in its press release that the team&#39;s players and officials are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in accordance with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
&quot;We firmly disassociate ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of match events,&quot; the announcement states.
HJK promises to help the authorities and the organizers of the event in finding out the factors that threaten safety and in removing mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important thing for HJK.
We support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stands in every possible way.
&quot;Violence is not part of it,&quot; the announcement says.
A Filipino inventor flies a drone car - this is how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and something of a Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing number of people around the world who swear they have invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
He has, for example, such factors as Audi and Airbus as competitors.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has used a large part of his wealth to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he flew his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device evokes positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: The industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in children&#39;s day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the overtime and shift change bans starting tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services and children&#39;s day care, says JHL&#39;s chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging, and they will certainly be seen in the way that there are not enough staff on hand.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their child.
The employer&#39;s task is now to make sure that the services work and that no one&#39;s life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were prohibited from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibilities, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for employees to work overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational health and safety, it is quite normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL takes action against the government&#39;s intentions to ease the dismissal protection of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, the labor market director of municipal employers, does not begin to assess the effects of overtime and shift change bans in advance.
However, he does not believe that they will be very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so impossibly vast, social and health care and the technical sector, that it&#39;s hard to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experiences were already gained from, for example, similar activities of the local and primary care association Super and the social and health professional association Tehy, which lasted three days.
Their effects were quite minor.
JHL&#39;s ban on overtime and shift changes applies to, for example, employees of municipalities, the church, the state, and the private social and health sector.
For example, family daycare workers are limited to the outside.
At this stage, the industrial action concerns almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL&#39;s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that we are running into a wall here, and hard.
In Jalonen&#39;s opinion, both the ay movement and the government must come together.
What is special here is that the hard work is already in the pipeline, even though the presentation has not been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by the strength of children and adults - in the show&#39;s fitness classes, the gestures of the stingray and the seahorse are studied
Suuri Koralliriutta by the Toisinen tilais collective premiered last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time at Kanneltalo.
Like the group&#39;s previous works, Suuri Koralliriutta is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a presentation with clear boundaries will also be built, which refreshes and summarizes the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is enough fairy-tale magic in the theater play even for child participants.
The child&#39;s point of view has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is still not a children&#39;s show, but a show that adults and children do together.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children&#39;s ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also loosens the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of a fairy tale ballet, a fitness club and a nature-themed knowledge attack, but ultimately it is tuned around visits to different, non-human living spaces.
The Great Coral Reef begins with getting to know the movement paths of corals and the organisms and fish that live on the coral reef.
In six different fitness circles, you will learn, among other things, the gestures of a stingray and a seahorse.
At the end, a performance of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both people diving, observing the life of the coral reef, and corals, which are being looked at.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
The glances and observations directed in many directions make the performance dense and teeming with life.
Be it the landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn&#39;t seem difficult at all.
In other places, the group strives to reach the border of thinking and action with its exercises, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for the endangered corals will be held at Citrator.
Destruction beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden us, even if it could be difficult to understand what significance there is in practicing compassion anymore in the face of destruction.
In other spaces, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears space.
Kids grow up too fast - I&#39;m happy I didn&#39;t have smartphones in my childhood
Today&#39;s children and young people are even more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at younger and younger ages.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives with drugs and sex because others say they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister from her &quot;boyfriend&quot; over the weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn&#39;t possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we were told and warned throughout our childhood that you shouldn&#39;t touch drugs and that sex is something for adults.
I wish that today&#39;s children could live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early due to peer pressure.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram wearing make-up and revealing clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing pictures at night.
It&#39;s getting harder and harder to guess how old girls are.
Today&#39;s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and I didn&#39;t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: The authorities told the government that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva interviewed by Yle, the security police and the defense forces went to inform the defense and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation of Airiston Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organized crime, reports Yle.
The information of the anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, chairman of the defense committee.
According to Kanerva, the defense forces and the security police visited the defense and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle&#39;s information, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found so far in the seized material, but the investigation is just beginning.
There is no way we can yet know what may be revealed there, says one of Yle&#39;s interviewees.
The extensive home searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely about economic crime or a threat to Finland&#39;s internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together an article in which arguments for and against are reviewed.
Video: dream goal saved Liverpool&#39;s unbeaten streak
Liverpool&#39;s 100 per cent start to the Premier League came to an end, but they were still the more contented side to draw 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away with a 1-0 victory.
That&#39;s when Pep Guardiola&#39;s combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And sure enough, Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to be in sole control of his own end of the pitch.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had Wednesday&#39;s great league cup away win at Anfield Road.
That&#39;s when Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played a triangle in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard lunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted through pass.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed a perfect left-footed drive into the back bottom corner.
Pool&#39;s brass keeper Alisson was a bit slow in his defense and could only get his fingertips to the ball.
Klopp must have felt the losing position slightly unfair, because almost immediately after, Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah&#39;s control from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa also got into real action.
The Basque keeper reacted quickly to Sadio Mané&#39;s pull and pushed the ball off the post for a corner kick.
At the other end, on the other hand, Alisson canceled Hazard&#39;s drive through with his throw.
The visitors&#39; best chance came in the 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his cross.
However, Brasstähti&#39;s header was aimed at national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts&#39; lead.
Even that didn&#39;t last anymore in the 89th minute, when Substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge was playing at his old home stadium, and the striker bombed an unopposed drive into the top corner to celebrate.
Liverpool&#39;s 100% start to the league ended with a 1-1 draw, but they are still top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship fight, two points behind the top.
In the clock shift debate, the differences are deep
I remember when, some decade ago, a magazine asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen&#39;s answer was the only one I remembered: the Nen ending.
Some have a nen ending in their last name and some don&#39;t.
After all, fault lines can appear anywhere, and here was one tray.
In the EU, Finland has managed to get rid of the annual clock change.
Many people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused many kinds of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest step of the solution, at least in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide which time to end up with: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows people to express their opinion on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The discussion is raging at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people&#39;s well-being, and those who defend summer time with the effect of evening light on people&#39;s desire for outdoor activities and thus on well-being.
Both positions have their strong supporters and good reasons.
According to research, the morning light rhythms a person&#39;s day and gives vitality.
On the other hand, if you don&#39;t particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, light increases people&#39;s movement outside and gives better opportunities for autumn yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I would prefer to take both, but unfortunately for our location in the northern corner of the globe, we can&#39;t do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical for the discussion on the topic that one&#39;s own point of view is promoted and the other&#39;s point of view is opposed very strongly.
The arguments of the other party are not listened to very much, because the most important thing is how the matter makes you feel.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it&#39;s somewhat pointless to try to change someone else&#39;s head.
It wastes gunpowder.
The topic is extremely easy to argue about, because it doesn&#39;t require a lot of effort, and a mutu feeling is enough for arguments.
Matters of the same type are usually argued about more sharply and just as fruitlessly.
It&#39;s a pity if the wrong option is chosen, but isn&#39;t it fitting for that as well?
And it always also offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels apocalyptic.
Josba fought for a close away win
Josba&#39;s first away game in floorball&#39;s Divar resulted in a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for home with a jubilant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with a goal at the beginning of the third period, but Josba searched for formations and rotated men in chains.
In a time of 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored a 6-5 winning goal.
When both teams froze, crucial minutes were played in a draw.
Josba&#39;s most effective player was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was also fiery, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also scored.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three series rounds.
Next up is O2-Jyväskylä away in two weeks.
The 200th anniversary celebration in Eno church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Kiihtelysvaara church a week ago was a shock.
Eno&#39;s church was also guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Although no one would like it that way, Eno&#39;s church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu parish association.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
The family mass starts at Eno&#39;s church today at 10 o&#39;clock.
After that, we move to the parish hall at the Karelian banquet table.
The program has all kinds of things both indoors and outdoors throughout the day.
For example, you can get to know the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired and worked as parish master for 37 years.
The Church&#39;s birthday also marks the end of an era.
The already decommissioned parish hall, built in 1982, will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we are in evacuation facilities at the former municipal hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood in its place for 200 years already.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla chairman - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company&#39;s CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the SEC, the authority that oversees the US securities market.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as chairman of Tesla&#39;s board for three years.
The company has to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk will also face stricter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent directors and monitor Musk&#39;s communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay 20 million dollars (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
&quot;The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders,&quot; Director Steven Peikin from the SEC says.
The incident started in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company&#39;s financing is secured.
The tweet momentarily raised Tesla&#39;s share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with the rest of the company&#39;s management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it is suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be sentenced to fines and banned from further managing listed companies.
The SEC&#39;s challenge spooked investors, and Tesla&#39;s stock began a sharp decline.
More than 800 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country&#39;s disaster agency, according to the AFP news agency.
It is believed that the number of fatalities will still increase, as the destruction is still under investigation.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final number may rise to thousands.
Friday&#39;s earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued right after the earthquake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all the known dead are from Palu, at least for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, for example, about the Donggala area, which is located near the center of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Several people are already known to have died.
Ruined pleas for help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived at the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, which is believed to still contain 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the agency leading rescue operations, said that one person was dug out of the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, popular with business travelers, at night.
We also heard people&#39;s calls for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be quickly dug in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Please help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend&#39;s family members still missing, one writer pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians&#39; phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to flaws in the app&#39;s encryption.
The intruders got access to, among other things, the phone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used at the party conference of the governing British Conservative Party.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who are pushing for Brexit, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassing calls.
Due to the app&#39;s lack of encryption, the public was able to access profiles of politicians in the app, which were on the Conservative Party&#39;s annual conference mobile app.
The public accessed the profiles using the politician&#39;s email address. which was easily available online.
The person logging into the profile could view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to briefly change Boris Johnson&#39;s profile picture to a pornographic image and the title to an offensive one.
Michael Goven&#39;s profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows logging into other people&#39;s profiles with their email addresses.
Then the user can view the profile person&#39;s contact information and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologized for the information leak.
He said the technical issues have been resolved and the app is now working safely.
The British data authority ICO supports the data leak.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labor Party criticizes that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week there is a large group of clapping Poles in the audience of The Wall Suomi quiz
Keen viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz show.
The American format The Wall, which spread quickly around the world, arrived as a Finnish version on Nelose last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The shooting opportunities in the Polish studio were exceptional, because the format&#39;s large 12-meter-high game wall required space from the space.
During the opening episode, social media highlighted the show&#39;s studio audience, which was guessed to be Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether the Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of Nelonen&#39;s domestic programs, Unne Sormunen, sheds light on the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes people close to the players, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
In the Finnish production, the audience consists of international clappers, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes in other countries, which are filmed in the same production space.
In Finland too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who visit the filming of various programs, Sormunen explains.
He reminds that following the game itself is not that difficult, even if you don&#39;t understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to tell apart.
For non-native speakers, however, there are interpreters in the studio who handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simultaneous interpretation for the studio director at all times.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to how they worked with David Hasselhoff recently in a domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Suomen here in Finland.
He had simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish on the set, Sormunen sums up.
The typhoon that devastated the southern parts of Japan is moving towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and there is no information on fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has flipped cars over.
According to public broadcaster NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off in more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains have stopped in some places because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly in the path of the storm, but strong winds and rains are expected there as well.
Train services have been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
Aces&#39; sky darkened even more
Aces&#39; early season has been bad.
The sky darkened to almost pitch black when the team lost to Vaasan Sport 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on their home field on Saturday.
Pori&#39;s team now has five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points from six rounds.
No Ässie defender or player in the lower two chains has yet scored a goal.
The pressures are also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the crowd already left the hall at the point when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that&#39;s how poorly we played.
The performance of the second set in particular was embarrassingly bad, said Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2 for Äss.
Sport naturally enjoyed the victory.
The team had a game from Friday below, so you would have thought it would be visible in the performance.
Maybe it was visible, but Ässät didn&#39;t know how to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the Bread Day continued to grow
Bread Day&#39;s mother Pirkko Hyvärinen marvels at the event&#39;s audience in the auditorium of the big hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen reflects in the morning.
In the fall of 2017, together with Leipäjää, the Traktorikynno SM competitions were organized, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of spectators could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the opposite happened; the corridors were quickly blocked before ten, the sellers said that they had run out of products, almost 500 more servings of news porridge were sold than before, and Hyvärinen heard that there had been an increase in the number of cars as well.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours in the morning and afternoon contained a lot of programs for families with children, which probably attracted a record number of attendees.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also come to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.
Bread day&#39;s mother PIrkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the stands of the hall.
At the beginning of Bread Day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children&#39;s series, Teija Kiviniemi&#39;s beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread entered the children&#39;s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at Marttoten&#39;s pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - this is how you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read a book without tiring your eyes.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We collected three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Innolux sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi gave the tips.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting increases the more years are behind.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that many people have with age, when the sharpness of vision decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As we get older, the need for light also increases.
A person in their sixties needs three times more light than a person in their twenties.
It is therefore worth investing in the nurturing effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, advises Jokiniemi.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be brought out with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The Japanandi style, which combines Scandinavian and Japanese, is popular.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s with strong colors, different shades of metal or ice cream colors has become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in the rest of the interior of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the home now than before, and interior design has become a way to express oneself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, even bold lamp with a story to tell for your own home.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we are very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
You don&#39;t necessarily get the latest trendy lighting for your home, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewel-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian forward after three games
KooKoo and striker Brendan O&#39;Donnell part ways.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League matches in the orange and black without any power points, KooKoo says in his press release.
O&#39;Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O&#39;Donnell&#39;s new club yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
The games specialist store Pelimies recycles not only games but also packaging materials today.
The products of Kivijalkauppa&#39;s customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All packages that come to us are reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula from Oulu&#39;s Pelimiehe.
As padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble wrap is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to switch to recycled material in envelopes as well.
The company wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause extra trouble.
It&#39;s not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used as new ones.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimie&#39;s operations, because in addition to new products, the store&#39;s main product selection includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
A purchase for every fashion conscious person: One and the same shirt works with every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in any outfit.
With their versatility, they create the basis of a good wardrobe, because it is easy to put together different outfits around high-quality classics, even at low prices.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality sweaters.
This category also includes a black polo.
A black sweater with polo collars made of natural material cannot be a wrong purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, a tulle skirt and jeans, and around it you can create both a restrained outfit and a flamboyant style.
The polo sweater is suitable for both the youthful modern wearer and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
Autumn&#39;s trendy look comes from golden brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, a black polo shirt and gray ankle boots.
A classic polo shirt together with other classics, a teal plaid skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Give a black polo shirt an edge by combining it with casual trendy pieces of clothing: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
The sabotage activities of the Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the foreign intelligence service of the Russian Federation, the SVR, or the military intelligence service, the GRU, have given up this modus operandi.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
Agents of the Soviet security service KGB who worked in Western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), the KGB&#39;s archivist who defected to the West.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew&#39;s books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets were, among others, ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB procured uniforms and accessories for DRG groups from the Bundeswehr, railways, game wardens and road workers for covert operations.
This was the trick used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid equipment packages containing mines, explosives, detonators and communication devices in the ground for sabotage groups.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, the mine exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
The police caught four drunk drivers in the province at night
The police caught four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per thousand.
He was driving at half past three in the morning at the head of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
On Polvijärvi&#39;s Kuorevaarantie, the car skidded into a ditch at four in the morning, and the 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 per thousand, according to the police.
He was not seriously injured in the run-out.
A 20-year-old man from out of town driving a car in the center of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per thousand into the breathalyzer.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunk driving, and the Polvijärvi driver of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a local 36-year-old man driving a van blew 0.52 per thousand.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
The police are asking for information about the stabbing that happened after midnight at the Turku train station.
According to the police, the man was assaulted in the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on a surveillance camera.
The dark-haired suspects, dressed in dark pants and a brown or beige jacket, left immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon in the direction of Ratapihankatu bus station.
One suspect left Humalistonkatu on a bicycle in the direction of the city center.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after being hit by a bus.
The accident happened after four in the morning in Raumantie near Niittumaa.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
The police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK will keep Riska in their ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen&#39;s trial period has ended
Hämeenlinna HPK&#39;s sports director Mika Toivola says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in starts, playing underpowered and in the defensive role of the four court.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn on a trial period, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the starts, playing underpowered and in the defensive role of the four court.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK&#39;s sports director Mika Toivola commented in the club&#39;s press release.
According to Toivola, Riska&#39;s value increases when the deciding games of the hockey league are played.
Riska, a center forward from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, winger Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
A true story on TV today: A climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man&#39;s own experiences.
The film of the evening is based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur&#39;s 2015 direction is about the struggle for survival, which has been handled in a grainy way.
Movies - and documentaries - have been made about the tragedy before.
Real events are also covered in this story.
The world&#39;s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers&#39; guide.
Weathers&#39; life may have been saved by eye surgery performed before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and the air pressure, he lost his eyesight, which is why the summit had to be skipped.
Rob Hall went on and never came back.
However, Weathers&#39; life-and-death struggle had only just begun.
When the storm arose, he got lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came to look for the man, he was found in such bad condition that it was not believed that he would survive.
Weathers was left to die.
Miraculously, however, he still got to his feet and found the others.
Badly frostbitten, Weathers was thought to be still dying and once again he was left to his own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the fellow climbers also started to believe in the possibility enough that they gave him help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin in the movie.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, the 200-year-old Eno church has been celebrated
Eno&#39;s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on kirkonmäki.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and in honor of the jubilee year, a party for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The festivities started at Eno&#39;s church hill at 10 o&#39;clock with a family mass, after which Karelian food was served at Eno&#39;s parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
The vicar of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was happy that so many people had come to the church.
It&#39;s a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire in the Kiihtelysvaara church has touched many people, and it was not ignored in the 200th anniversary of the Eno parish.
Eno&#39;s church is now the oldest of Joensuu&#39;s Evangelical Lutheran congregations after Kiihtelysvaara&#39;s church was destroyed in a fire.
Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
In Kiihtelysvaara, a devotion was organized in the morning, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Pictures and videos: The medic flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from the southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Department has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between the houses in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia region, instead of a street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been carried away by the floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, a strong wind caused strong seas.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The mission urges you to follow the weather reports and the instructions of the local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings with it heavy rains and even the risk of flooding.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medicans occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm, which is now blowing, left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north towards Europe.
Refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos have also caused concern in Greece.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited opportunities to get proper shelter.
Areas around Athens destroyed by wildfires in the summer will also be affected by the storm.
In Greece, the medical crisis also raged last November.
You shouldn&#39;t go to the sea now, flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are canceled and even when walking you should be careful not to let branches or other loose objects fly over you in a storm.
The guides have given out such instructions to more than 3,500 Finns vacationing in Greece through Aurinkomatkat on the weekend.
The instructions will be needed, because even the terrible storm Zorbas has been predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can reach up to 45 meters per second in gusts.
Heavy rains add to the vitriol of the weather.
According to the tour organizers, all those who have traveled to Greece from Finland through Aurinkomatkat and Tui, who have given their phone number, have been warned about strong winds by text message.
The air is still sunny and warm
According to Aurinkomatkat&#39;s communication expert Inka Ikonen, by early Saturday evening, the worst has been avoided in the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Safety comes first.
Tui&#39;s media representative Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also run on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at the destination.
At least Crete was still calm, he said on Saturday about the early evening.
Tui currently has a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, the sun was shining on Rhodes on Saturday afternoon and the temperature reached 27 degrees, Aurinkomatkojen Ikonen says.
It is estimated that Zorbas will be the next problem for Turkey, albeit somewhat toned down.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui for example, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in the miss final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says that he got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me an absolutely wonderful suit for this evening, Hussi smiles.
Host Shirly Karvinen had also chosen the exact same silver evening dress.
The two themselves also noticed their similar outfits and reacted to the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he got busy with the preparations, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet presenter at the miss finale, and he talks to the front-row stars who arrive.
Huss has recently moved, as he moved from Kampi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I&#39;m going to stay there for now, let&#39;s see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen&#39;s behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected curious looks from pensioners
Presenter and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland finale that she had enough to do with radio shows and filming Love Island Finland.
The rush has even been enough to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from a Finnair flight.
I did my makeup and put my hair in a machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says that he pulled out his make-up in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of his fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people&#39;s eyes in the mirror.
My make-up was amusing, at least according to others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marbella.
Karvinen says that he enjoyed his time as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far as also stopping.
Karvinen says that he went to say goodbye to the program&#39;s singles on Friday.
It&#39;s really raw in a way.
They are people&#39;s genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program&#39;s singles.
How do I wear over the knee boots?
Three perfect sample outfits
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in any outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes more modern specimens can also be included.
Over-the-knee boots, which became the hit shoes of the fall and winter season a few years ago, have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, over-the-knee boots are stylish year after year and season after season.
Showy boots divide users&#39; opinions, but you should try a bold model, well - boldly.
Actually, over-the-knee boots go well with any kind of outfit.
Whether it&#39;s denim, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or faux leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good both in a party look and in casual outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots go well with casual outfits.
They perfectly balance the femininity of the pink, floral pleated skirt and the fluffy, fluffy sweater.
A fresh but autumnally stylish casual outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, striking earrings and a small clutch bag.
Although there is a certain sophistication to over-the-knee boots, they are also perfect for a casual casual outfit together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, informs the city of Espoo.
Otaniemi&#39;s robot cars act as a bus simulator, because next spring, the area plans to start traffic with a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the vehicles&#39; technical functionality under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robot cars can cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars travel fully automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The co-passenger sitting on board is always responsible for the safety of the vehicles.
The vehicles sense their surroundings all the time with several different sensors and assess whether the roadway is free.
If it is not, they interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
The robot cars run three days a week throughout the fall: Tuesdays from 13:00 to 15:30, Wednesdays from 10:00 to 15:00 and Thursdays from 10:00 to 15:00.
The robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops can be identified by the stop markings.
The safest way to get on is from stop number 1 on Otakaari.
The bassist of the band Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of the show and was injured
The band Mokoma informs on their Facebook page about the surprising situation at the Pakkahuone gig in Tampere.
The Mokoma band&#39;s gig at Tampere&#39;s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band&#39;s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was playing the last song of the evening.
Hämäläinen&#39;s wrist was broken.
The band informs about it on their Facebook page.
&quot;We&#39;re alive!&quot;
Yesterday Santtu tripped from the stage at Pakkahuone during the last song and broke his wrist.
We wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the gigs on the tour will be handled by backup crew, it says on the pages.
Mokoma&#39;s fans respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist Santtu is lying on a bed with a cast in hand.
We have been waiting for this news, we were very worried about how bad it was.
The relief is great, fortunately the bones heal over time.
Cheers and a speedy recovery to Santu and good continuation of the tour to the rest of the band plus the tour guide!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but do you promise to leave such strong drama at the end of gigs in the future? writes one fan.
The police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday together with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Center in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department&#39;s team members said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, hunting weapons possession permits and the permitted cartridge quantities of self-loading weapons used in fowling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter who lacked the required hunting license was found during the surveillance.
The hunter was fined 12 days for illegal hunting.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, the police said.
In summary, it can be stated that the hunters follow the legality of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the supervision.
One hunter stated that &quot;I&#39;ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits&quot;.
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting supervision in the fall together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
The Minister of the Interior, Kai Mykkänen, will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to accept 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and are attended by representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Labor and the Economy, and the police.
The delegation is currently in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects people who are in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, for example single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group of people coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
On his trip, Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs working on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, head of the office of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the trip.
There has been talk of raising the quota
Finland has accepted quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 per year, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The coalition has supported raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen due to the resistance of the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) recently proposed gradually increasing the quota to 1,500-2,000 people a year.
Mykkänen&#39;s visit is the first in this government period that the Minister of the Interior will visit the place to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous ministers of the interior, Petteri Orpo (coordinator) and Paula Risikko (coordinator), had time to move to their new positions before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 in support from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable position.
Now let&#39;s go to the hakotes - you don&#39;t know whether to cry or laugh anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on the bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
From the article, I got the impression that the bill basically prohibits the keeping of all such animals as farm animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities, which are not specifically allowed by ministerial decrees.
So basically everything else is prohibited except for the animals mentioned separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends up becoming a law, it means that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety of society or good manners.
Now we are in the process of enacting, in principle, the banning of all such activities that are not specifically permitted by law or regulation.
The change means that you can&#39;t try anything new, for example, in business activities or do anything else until the law or regulation approving it has been issued.
The government&#39;s performance in law preparation in general has been weak.
If we now go down the path that basically everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don&#39;t doubt that the Animal Protection Act needs updating.
But a legislative project in this direction does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know the constitution very well, but maybe it accepts such a &quot;everything is prohibited that is not specifically allowed in the law or regulation&quot; procedure.
I hope there will be a sensible minister who will stop the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell advises: Autumn&#39;s four trendiest skirts
This fall&#39;s trendy clothing comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Pair the snake print skirt with more understated tops like a polo or plain t-shirt to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn, there is a lot of silk, and the silk skirt in particular is one of the trendiest pieces of clothing of the season.
Pair a gorgeous silk skirt with a sophisticated feminine top or casually with a sweater.
You can play more daringly with a silk skirt and throw on, for example, sneakers or cowboy boots, trendy fall shoes.
It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s gray, brown or multi-colored, all checkered skirts are now part of every woman&#39;s must-have fall clothes.
Feel free to combine different colors and play with check patterns with different-sized tops.
For example, the combination of check patterns and ball patterns is beautiful.
Asymmetric hems are a breath of summer lightness that you can take with you into autumn.
The asymmetric hem is feminine and playful at the same time and is great for both everyday life and parties.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, purrs sweetly in Jere&#39;s arms
In Karalahti&#39;s family photo, sweet three-month-old baby Alexia becomes the center of attention.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito daycare center established in Kerava.
Fitness entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, had a family addition at the beginning of July.
The couple&#39;s firstborn son Jax turned 2 years old in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp for trainees with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, which was attended by the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted a picture of the atmosphere in Spain on Instagram, where the entire Karalahti family poses.
Children Jax and Alexia are in their parents&#39; arms.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly squirming baby Alexia, who is resting in Jere&#39;s father&#39;s arms.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, people&#39;s generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti next to the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti, who came to the public from the program Fitness päiväkirjat, and ex-hockey player Jere Karalahti recently went into the daycare business and opened the Aito daycare center in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the director of the daycare center.
In Turkey, people are advised to charge mobile phones in case of a storm
Storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists especially warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is said to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens early Saturday evening to charge their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure the functionality of the internet connection so that people can receive current situational updates, reports the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows and to move, for example, garden furniture out of the way of the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organizing trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A while ago, when I contacted you, it was very windy and raining there.
People were quite calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday evening.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages about Finns in distress either.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were canceled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.

Kimi Räikkönen summarized the reason for Mercedes&#39; superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari&#39;s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too tough in the qualifying sessions of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it&#39;s no big deal.
Our car was the best in qualifying the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, said Räikkönen, who drove fourth and was clearly behind the Mercedes pace with his teammate Sebastian Vettel.
It was already difficult for Ferrari in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than us - it&#39;s that simple.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go as fast as them.
However, I don&#39;t know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In qualifying, we saw a rare treat for Räikkönen&#39;s future team Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
The Swedish driver&#39;s tenth starting place is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session no less than five drivers did not drive at all, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were from the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been big.
Next year will be a different story, so we&#39;ll see, we&#39;ll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: &quot;Robbe is back&quot;
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teperi in the evening in Stuttgart progressed smoothly.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he didn&#39;t land any decent hits.
Helenius, who was clearly more reachable, controlled the match with his hard sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the fighter, who was fighting in front of the home crowd, didn&#39;t even try to get up from the mat.
After the victory was secured, Helenius vented quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a while.
Thanks to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius&#39; career.
There might be a chance to even get to the World Cup match, Helenius commented to Iltalehte before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has crossed my mind.
It&#39;s not getting any younger here, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the match against Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the country&#39;s vice president urges to be prepared for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country&#39;s vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for those trapped and also the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Palu and its neighboring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings whom the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and clean up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area, electricity and telecommunication connections are cut in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running low.
The Miss Suomi finalist&#39;s hesitant answer and long deliberation caused laughter
A new Miss Finland is currently being chosen in Ruukki, Billnäs.
In the interview round, each mission finalist was asked a question.
The finalists drew a question from a glass bowl on stage.
Especially the hesitant answer of the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused sweet but good-natured laughter in the audience present.
The question posed to Anttikoski had come via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book that the missi finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a long time before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I&#39;ve read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
The pause for thought caused a burst of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I read is...
I did read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I&#39;ve read is someone on economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received resounding applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the pageant tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, because he did not want to pose in underwear due to his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21:00, when last year&#39;s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm relinquishes the crown.
Sike&#39;s apple and pear cake will blow your mind
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples from your backyard, because domestic apples are shockingly expensive in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, although quite a few people already have that pear tree growing.
This cake can also be made only with apples if you don&#39;t want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if you also put a pear in the cake.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the cores.
Slice it.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar until foamy and then add cornmeal and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the cornstarch, i.e. Maizena, and the baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a loaf pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the batter over the pear slices and the apple chunks over the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batter over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is nicely browned.
Allow to cool in the pan and then turn out onto a serving platter.
Only cut the cake when it is properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour, which do not contain gluten.
An international crime fiction event will be held in Ruka in January
In January, an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held in Ruka, Kuusamo.
The program of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary program numbers as well as jazz music.
Among the festival&#39;s literary guests will be the star of Swedish detective fiction, Jens Lapidus, and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, behind the author name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature guest writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers are represented at the event by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don&#39;t attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers at the University of Sydney who analyzed the matter have outlined two types of &quot;coolness&quot; consisting of slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive coolness and the somewhat opposite dissident coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers&#39; description, had many traits considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable and competent.
Dissidents were characterized by distance, independence, rebelliousness and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and cared little for the opinions of outsiders.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
Kovinsen&#39;s role is not cool in the long run: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what a US study published in Child Development magazine says in 2014.
Young people who dated early, partied, joined groups of good-looking people and strived to be liked by others had an increased risk of using intoxicants and committing crimes as young adults.
In their interpersonal relationships, they did worse than their once more inconspicuous peers.
Luxury cars, branded bags or watches that signal high status do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more ready to make friends with people wearing a regular market shirt than with a brand-name shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand-name shirt when getting to know each other.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, beware!
A hurricane is hitting there - the weather warning is screaming red
During the weekend, it can rain as much in southern Greece as it rains in Finland on average during six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish embassy in Athens announces it on their Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca&#39;s blog.
According to it, the storm&#39;s strongest Gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm that battered Finland since the beginning of the week blew at its strongest at a good 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern with Storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
At the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can fall in southern Greece.
It corresponds to about half of Finland&#39;s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Suomi Duck drooled by men?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that Anku, the beauty drooled over by several men in the Love Island Suomi series, also appears in strange YouTube videos published in 2010 as a crafting aunt.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make an octopus from an old paper towel roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can make a hedgehog out of tights that grows real thorns.
Now let&#39;s make the Easter grass grow, but let&#39;s do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints and presents sawdust, tights and ragweed seeds, from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku&#39;s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton&#39;s helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a little tens of minutes after his pole position in the Russian GP, when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left Mercedes&#39; number one star Lewis Hamilton behind and was certainly important mentally for the Finnish driver, who has been criticized this season.
Nice tour.
I don&#39;t know what happened to Lewis when he left the solving round.
It feels good, I&#39;m still shaking a little, Bottas explained.
I&#39;ve only been on pole once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so quite a bit of time has passed.
This track has been good for me in the past and I got good laps again.
It&#39;s not easy to overtake on the Sochi track, so the start plays a particularly big role.
And of course, Bottas got to answer the question, whether he will drive for victory tomorrow or whether he will face Hamilton who is approaching the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
There can be no other goal when starting from pole, Bottas poled.
But as a team we are fighting for both championships.
Lewis&#39;s lead over Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference for me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let&#39;s see what happens, Bottas added.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottas&#39; success, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also liked what he saw.
Lewis had the intention of beating Valtteri, but he didn&#39;t succeed in the stop corner.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was pouring out of his ears, Wolff beamed.
To the question whether the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive freely, Wolff answered evasively.
We&#39;ll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen, from Kite, won the rally Finnish championship
The rally car championship series ended in a rare way.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula in the final rally around Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career, when the third place in the final race sealed the Finnish championship for the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, who is competing on a Honda Civic, and map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race in a calm manner, because the starting point was clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give an equalizer when some of the additional lights failed on the second special test.
In that, you could blindly sift through the third clip.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to be lazy.
On Saturday, we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the US, France and Turkey withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and the war against terrorists is &quot;almost over,&quot; he said.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end in sight to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria is planned for October, in which the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey would participate in addition to her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court justice drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, brought an extraordinary number of people to the screens.
In the United States, the Supreme Court judge nomination drama in full swing brought at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, the Californian professor who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
According to the preliminary results, a total of 20.4 million viewers watched the hearings on the six main channels, i.e. ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more followed the consultation online.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live stream, and CNN reported that it set a record for the year with 8.2 million live starts.
CNN&#39;s number rises to more than 10 million when you include those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital startups are owned by the channels, TV viewership figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final numbers on Monday, but they are huge anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, only sports matches and the big Oscar and Grammy galas of the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates, reach viewership numbers of more than 20 million.
The annual Most Watched program in the USA, the final match of the American Football League NFL, the Super Bowl, is of course on the way.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people watching the NBC channel.
According to Nielsen, nearly 48 million people watched Trump&#39;s first speech to Congress last year, and more than 30 million people watched the inauguration.
A very important thing
The appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the USA, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
Another seat opened up when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was the so-called weighing angel, whose vote could decide the position of the nine-member court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided with his vote that same-sex couples were given the right to marry in the entire federal state.
Kavanaugh is significantly more conservative in his stance.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock in the conservative supremacy of the judiciary for decades.
Children have the right to have their information shared with their parents
Only parents of children under 10 can see their children&#39;s health information on the Kanta service.
It&#39;s a big problem, it&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s weird.
Originally, the situation with the Kanta service was of course even more worrying: parents could not even look at their little ones&#39; health information or prescriptions.
The situation was corrected in the fall of 2016, characterized as temporary, for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazingly long time to correct them.
Now the repair is planned - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a shout-out.
After that, with a layman&#39;s understanding, it&#39;s all about pressing a button: now that the door is closed, it&#39;s opened.
Of course, the child can show his information to his parents - if he has bank credentials or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
There is a fee for an identity card, and a 10-year-old can&#39;t even get a bank ID.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a fourth-grader in elementary school except by requesting it printed out.
It is not so much about the rights of the parents as it is about the rights of the children.
It is extremely important for the child&#39;s care that the parents can be involved.
Of course, teenagers&#39; right to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations where not all issues can be freely discussed.
They are often related to sexual health, the free care of which is a deeply meaningful human right.
In the United States, the FBI began investigating allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
Another of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations regarding alleged sexual harassment during his college days.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, it is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaani
The arrested rabble-rouser continued to bully even in the chamber.
The police say they put the man in the police jail to &quot;calm down&quot;.
The police was threatened by a suspected abuser the night before Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities inform about the incident, which started when a 30-foot-tall man violently provoked an argument in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the brawler attacked another man, knocking him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man hit him again.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took him to the Kajaani police station, the police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another police officer in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
The police say they took the man to the police prison &quot;to calm down&quot;.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violently resisting an official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work in Indonesia&#39;s Sulawesi - &quot;Clean water is the most urgent&quot;
The UN children&#39;s organization Unicef and other international aid organizations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF&#39;s information manager in Finland.
The local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for additional help is already evident at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef is always fully prepared for emergency aid, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palu in Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala area a little further north, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also crossed, states Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often of light construction, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - initially tents, for example - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent thing in crisis situations.
First, people can usually be offered water purification tablets, which Unicef also has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first transported by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is one part of Unicef&#39;s mission.
Food aid is organized by, among other things, the World Food Program (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, previously collected funds are used for emergency aid.
Among other things, however, Unicef has already started collecting money to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk steps down as Tesla chairman - fined $20 million for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges with an agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his position as the chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to fines of 20 million dollars.
Musk is stepping down as part of an agreement he reached with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids accusations of fraud.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud due to his tweets in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock market, which caused the company&#39;s stock price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to serve as the chairman of Tesla&#39;s board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new &quot;independent member&quot; to its board and take two &quot;independent directors&quot; to its management team.
Tesla must also establish a committee to monitor Musk&#39;s communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk&#39;s personal fine of 20 million dollars, the Tesla company also has to pay a corresponding fine of 20 million to the financial regulator.
The tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk&#39;s Tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire&#39;s tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at a share price of $420.
Tesla&#39;s share price rose by more than ten percent in a day after the tweets, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk&#39;s claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company&#39;s board.
On Friday of this week, the stock fell 14 percent when the securities regulator SEC announced the fraud charge.
The news of the agreement is expected to strengthen the company&#39;s course again.
The final judgment is not the reason
Naturally, the cathedral bells do not ring when the hands are not moving.
It&#39;s a technical fault.
The clock on the Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
The hands point to twelve o&#39;clock.
The situation is like something out of a mediocre horror movie: even though exorcisms could be heard from the church crypt and the organ was playing by itself.
Naturally, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped due to a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been looked at by a repairman, but a part has broken and a new part is expected, Suntio Eveliina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Kirkko Helsingissä Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the church bells are not ringing because of a fault.
