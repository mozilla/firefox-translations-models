A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found
Police have had a search mission due to the escape of a 9-year-old boy in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing person's report concerning a boy who has left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police's situation centre, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomat around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's okay, and now we're starting to look after.
The boy was found near the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again fierce - tore the goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and also continued to score in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goaltender turned, at least for a moment, to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo took the lead in the all-time goal scorer's record when he shot into the net by the visitor Shahtar Donetsk with two shots from a penalty and one from a game.
Ronaldo increased his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has 77 goals.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian Football League's Serie A in the early part of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League, they started strongly with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of a knee-blown Sergei Aguero.
In the Premier League game this weekend, the injured Aguero only came on to the pitch in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a tough one in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
The 20-year-old ManU's 20-year-old defenseman, Luke Shaw's away game, lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the ManU pack, which had been attacking the goal, so badly that Shaw was likely to fracture his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium a dozen minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break in extra time.
The winning goal for PSV was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season's Champions League started with Group A's Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria, who changed the Manchester United shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the season's successes.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best possible comparison.
PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional starting club Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow CSKA, lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a Group B match in Germany.
Opposition party immediately demanded resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has re-held the same speech he made at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had taken place solely on Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with the influence of China on the country's economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary EU leaders' summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register in Europe more effectively.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of Ministers of the Interior.
The teacher admits to shooting girlfriend during an emergency call
The voice of the only slightly vibrating university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb emphasized that her “golden dog” is alive and probably shocked, as well as saying that the contact details of the next of kin of the dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found a handwritten message on the page of Amy Prentiss and the booklet: “I’m so sorry I wish I could take this back I loved Amy and she’s the only woman she’s ever loved me,” said the letter, which, according to experts, was signed by Lambi.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Lynn Buford, the head of police at Delta State University, said the university officials had heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide when the police surrounded him.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released reports that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but may have had problems.
The students said they expected his classes.
Police in the place where Prentiss died, Gautier, said Lambi had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, “as if something was wrong.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and the position of assistant professor.
University rector William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled the campus, police got to his trail when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb fired himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a kilometre and a half south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, said Methel Johnson, a medical examiner at Washington County.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but there was no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
“He’s really shocked,” O’Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at a few gigs.
O’Steen told me that his daughter is doing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a variety of online businesses.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and intermittent entertainment organizer at the shady bar The Julep Room, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
“Only a happy couple,” he said.
We messed around and threw tricks at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, said the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his brotherhood and student board.
On Tuesday evening, a candlelit devotion was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi's Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Pettus Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected, according to the fact that the police say that Lamb has now made an emergency call after Schmidt's shooting, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but a toy and baby food retailer says that current permanents and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centers across the country, compared with 45 000 paid during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although the holidays are months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help manage the stores, as well as selling, shippinging and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his ‘date’ with Princess Diana
The premiere of Return to the Future was Michael J. A very important moment for Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The movie begins and it pops into my mind that I'm just a yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and director Robert Zemecks and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “For me, it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie of all time.”
Back in Time is available on request, on DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The U.n. leader says the situation in Syria will not be solved in a rugal manner
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict will not be “solved in a weapony” and that additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the Divided UN Security Council, to unify and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the occasion of the General Assembly's Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional power factors “has made the situation impossible to resolve.”
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and unanimity with regard to the Syrian crisis, which they showed in the agreement of Iran's nuclear programme.
8 poll results that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a vane.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump out of the top spot in the polls, it hasn't (yet) been successful.
Of the latest 11 national polls, 10 have led Donald Trump in a double-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's appointment possibilities.
The election period is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of which got a single state behind it in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems with the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and have begun using their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a complete turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans are now welcoming Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of “excited” vs. Trump's 40%).
The next most exciting one?
Marco Rubio by only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be “dissatisfied” or “shocked” if the rulers’ favorite, Jeb Bush, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his grandiose speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-sided voters at national level think the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's survey last week, the figure in the first party convention in Iowa state is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to a ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten people considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated for a Republican nomination.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release: Republican Party voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
During the last term in the election, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters consider the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to support the second candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as support against Trump has been split among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the support of a majority in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only winning candidate of Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a big 18-point gap.
A majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
The situation can, of course, change, and no one can be absolutely certain that they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's grandeur will push Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new height.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their status outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they'd rather choose someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “dissatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance during Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour Labour Party, will face David Cameron for the first time during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises up to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs will closely watch his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show “less theatre and more facts.”
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow board and speaking at the annual meeting of the trade unions' central organization on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for the British Air War, has attracted criticism from the Conservative Party's MPs and appeared in several front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn’s spokesman said he “respectfully stalled silently” and that he acknowledges “the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.”
Mr Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he had urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he felt that the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements on economic, defence and foreign affairs. Initially, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences regarding the party’s position in the European Union and the government’s aid cap have “piled up” within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the trade union confederation that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government's employment and pensions secretary, said that the party was "quite clear" in terms of the fact that they are merely opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron in the last decade of being the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has ‘crossified’ ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Corbyn, a member of parliament in the Islington North region, has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontal and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and sniping, promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the finance secretary of the shadow government, will replace her in Question Time when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he had approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often associated with the prime minister's Question Time, but later had to admit that he failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of the judgement of the leader, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Time for making it a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tricky place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
‘I was shot in Joburg’ is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to complete the project.

The value of the pound rises as the UK's wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in the UK's wage growth, and at the same time, the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July, the UK's wages, excluding bonuses, rose 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the increase in prices.
The pound rose above one percent against the dollar to 1.5505 dollars, and 0.84 percent against the euro to 1,3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49 percent increase to 629.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose 20 percent after it was approached by competitor AB InBev with a quote.
The agreement would bring together two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the rival luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised US$2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The Mond stocks in the packaging and paper group were the biggest calculators in the index by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations for the company to “sell.”
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after a sportswear company released information about its six-month return before taxes: an 83 percent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the head of JD Sports, higher wages could damage the expansion
Peter Cowgill, president of JD Sports, said that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers is growing.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill says.
The costs could be in the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi's intrusion into the industry
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA deal from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA traders' market share in South and Western Australia ahead of Aldi's 700 million dollar attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, where up to 120 stores are coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like the ice cream maker Simmo’s from Dunsborough offer a taste of the IGA’s stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler will hold an annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30 percent of the territory of Metcash IGA stores, where the yield margins are higher than those of the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
For South and Western Australia, shoppers are known to be parochial, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the West compared to 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will grab about 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first moves. Turnover is obtained from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose US$360 million in sales each year and Metcash could lose US$250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the West, generating a turnover of 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about 13 million dollars in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, with its market share dropping from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the head of the Lead Investment Fund and founder of the Magella Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “well possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has publicly declined to respond to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the board of Metcash had contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which supplies products to approximately 1200 IGA dealers, have declined by 43 percent since 2012. This indicates a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler holds its own, and has invested more than US$150 million each year, lowering the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by increasing the faster-growing fresh food, and launching a better range of private brand products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says lower prices and upgrading stores have increased the appeal, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been forced to suffer as a bystander in a recent storm that has been raging around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own conduct, said Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo, called the ‘Special Ks’, was involuntarily made public in the case of annoyance by Kyrgios in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the head referee had to twice separate the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: “Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid.”
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defenseman for the Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I’m pretty strong in the opinion that Thanasi has just been drawn into the brawl,” Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost his cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature until he is 19 years old, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and has never had a problem with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also advocated a decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games that will begin on Friday, describing this “joint decision” as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberraan’s return to the team’s regular fleet.
“We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye to reflect on these consequences.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally. The aim is to defame the flow of migrants entering the country.
The border was followed by chaos as hundreds of migrants flocked to a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence of their home countries have now set up their tents and, for an indefinite period of time, settled on a section of the road between the two-country checkpoints.
But the frustration increased.
While a police helicopter remained above them, the migrants said, “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian foreign minister declared that it was “impossible to accept” the return of migrants from Hungary, as more and more of them are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
Discussions must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The mayred on the Hungarian-Serbian border was created after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40 000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries will take in 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will be operating in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to act in the crisis and allowed you to be shut down and asylum cases to be speeded up.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country also intends to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry point in the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing the war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing the war, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly incompatible with that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now define the attempt to cross or damage the 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and includes longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear: Crossing the border illegal is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the positioning of the military next week, but the Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had apprehended 45 people while trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in custody by the police, and they are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border with Serbia after sending a barbed-wire-covered train carriage to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds tried to shove inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 election: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead the Democratic nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders will close him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and the second-placed Sanders is backed by 27 percent (from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who they would vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand firmer behind their own choices than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is heavily in the lead among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among the men has dropped considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and she's now level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It's not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
Whereas 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, Republican number one Donald Trump says the same goes for fewer Republican voters (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked on the open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had a suitable experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular responses were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the Vice President influences a possible presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagree.
When asked from Democratic voters who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's lead over Sanders will grow. If Biden joins, the lead is 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the figure is 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
By this standard, Biden will fall far, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voted has increased.
However, when asked the Democratic voters what was most important in the candidate, they put their opinions ahead of their voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden fares best from the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders' (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are ideologically agreed.
Looking at all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server use while she's secretary of state still raises questions, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation and say the issue didn't affect their opinion on her.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the email poll didn't affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has gotten worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider her honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month, as well as by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's registered voters also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Six of the candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people don't have an opinion about him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the survey involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new poll, two candidates collected half of all the votes, leaving the others to fight for the foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent in a previous CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election debate, from 23% in a poll released Tuesday.
However, Carson rose from 6 percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with different demographics and is ousting Trump among collegeed Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Support for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third in 6 percent.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest survey of 376 Republican voters conducted in September is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him with 32 percent.
According to a poll by the latest ABC News/Washington Post, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, although Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday’s campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died in a fraternity hazing ceremony in the Pocono Mountains district of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during the rite of his membership in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were blindfolded and his back loaded with a backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but said the accusations waited for an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the brotherhood's national president, Andy Meng, asking him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus, in practice, put the brotherhood’s well-being ahead of Michael Deng,” police chief Wagner said.
They couldn't get Deng to come back, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated blunt object blows to the head, body and thighs.
“Too many families have been affected by the fraternity hazing, while each year at least one student has died as a result since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Committee argued that the first five members were charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Order, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal intrigue.
“We don’t want to be held accountable by individuals. If there is an organisation behind the incident that approved the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at Tuesday’s press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood vented its connection to the local branch.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising prices will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will have to regress.
This is what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take for all this or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help in terms of timing, when it comes to the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months after the first drawdown, and sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are starting to be raised, but mainly on the development of the time to normalize the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants may find that all the fuss related to the rate hike has been excessive.
“The central bank’s first post-glom economic increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, Capital Economics’ chief economic expert on global affairs, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels such a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an impact.
Below is a look at how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As we have seen on the market in the last month or so, waiting for a raise in interest rates can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which in turn potentially reflects a lag in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank’s raise.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market tends to be on a strong, about 14 percent increase when approaching the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (the average increase of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief capital strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on stocks is usually clearer at a later stage of the uplift cycle when returns start to fall.
Recessions are a part of the economy, but interest rate lifts often contribute to their arrival.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has been just twice less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain, compared with 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic situation may be risky and raise the question of ‘is this time different’, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise throughout the year, and everyone is awaiting this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe the committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25 percent probability.
“Our study shows that since 1950, all the upward cycles have so far been in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after the stimulus has begun,” the report said.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting by far the longest since the end of the final recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
The fixed return has also been unstable as the market waited for the interest rate hike, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations of capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the proceeds of the bonds appears to be immediately changing at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yield immediately drops,” Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause a convergence of longer- and shorter-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a situation, although “we’re still cautious about the search for profit,” said Kathy Jones, a solid-yield analyst at Schwab.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
“In addition to the dollar’s strength and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies whose business operations are mainly located in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt will perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than their financing.
“History shows that ‘high-quality’ stocks tend to be more lucrative in the three months after the first rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover surpassed weak turnover companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality companies. The average for the former was 4 (percentage points) and that of the latter was 3 (percentage points).
The debt becomes a big problem.
“Those companies with a lot of variable-rate debt are losing the most,” Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Also, savers can make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames the channel for ‘public awareness’
He argues that it becomes increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor
He also took on the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards
Member of Parliament's colleague, Damien Collins, criticized The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is ‘turning’ into a Classic FM, claims the lead MP, adding to the production company’s pressure to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station was “public-speaking” of its content, and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial rival.
“It seems that Radio 3 – I don’t want to use the term ‘people’s popularity’ – is turning into a Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seems like a Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two direct examples of what I remember when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the audience, as the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and is by no means original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced “in the style of the BBC.”
He added that he wants the production company to “discover success inside his own house” the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of the upcoming The Voice periods, or to order the money of the licensees to be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest since the statistics began in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were boosted by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could curb consumption
Making virtual shopping has been growing tremendously for more than a decade and has transformed many of the UK's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of an online sales offset in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase for the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption in August grew the least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed a 7 percent increase for the first quarter of 2015.
“If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time,” Andy Mulcahy, a JMRG sales index reporter, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were boosted when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it's smoothing out, and (growth) can go down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which is imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing deals.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday event in November.
Last year, five times more buyers than the usual average flocked to their computers to grab the stores, crashing the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue about the findings, could curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five were spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains for shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in the Mecca crane accident, Bin Laden's family with consequences
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The health ministry said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed
29 The dead were carried through the streets in the air, when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims were killed when a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Mostly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead to make their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place where, just a few days ago, a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and toppled worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family's construction group was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by the crane killed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca, 29 bodies were carried across the streets
Among the dead was the father of four, Qasim Akram of Bolton, from the Manchester region. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been to a grand mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands constantly arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
A decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency in Arabic said that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published any notices of the crane crash and no members of it have been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date protective measures and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mecca Grand Mosque, which are part of the huge building rob that the Binlad Group is leading.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi royal family for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the death to be paid one million rials (174 000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that Eastern European workers working cheaply are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of aides, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paintbrushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovation work
It seems that if you're nifty with a hammer or a hook to paint walls, you're in the minority these days.
For the British are hiring more and more helpers to do DIY work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind the B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home renovation chain, said that the popularity is due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten buying decisions made in the store are made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: Today, there are more one-woman households where more home renovations are carried out than before.
Laury said, “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions of our products are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women who lead the UK's FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his management team in such a way that it has equal number of male and female superiors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of women are in the group, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is important here.
It hasn’t been hard to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher reported a decline in both six-month revenues and sales after the group took down the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a large demonstration by employees.
A lot of people think that's when reason stands.
Let's ask if it's worth going on strike when things are going badly.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50 000 people have already reported on the Internet that they do not intend to take part in the demonstration, but go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly proclaiming to be a scab would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest by a few dozen thousand people in millions of trade unions does not matter much, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone is familiar with the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the trade union movement's operations, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, now the unions are finally getting to the point, i.e. defending the rights of the employee, visibly and properly.
The government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what you think about the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial output has already declined for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment rises.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
A tough savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Aiming for 8.5 million savings, staff reductions by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings programme, the aim of which is to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the University will start co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, the savings target of which is 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The co-operation negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which predicts that the actual operations will be in deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
In this financial year, the University will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
Expenses will increase slightly next year, but the funding received from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and the rest of the funding by 3.2 million euros.
The University's total budget is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in business funding to our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in complementary funding is reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with the shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish railroad.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK," Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to gradually open to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After the commuter traffic, there will be long-distance traffic.
Souter has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail traffic elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation will not be resolved yet and interest rates will be kept at the current 0-0.25 percent level.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get off zero and start the normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been working relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was “sorry” for the first murder and hoped “to be able to cancel it,” officials said Tuesday.
The Missississippin Gautier police said that Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the emergency number at about ten in the morning
Monday and told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “doesn’t bother anyone” but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't tell him.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb that read: “I’m so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when he was surrounded by police.
University rector William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that “there was clearly something in Lamb’s mind.”
Authorities said Tuesday that despite claims published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no “information or evidence” of any kind of “triangular drama.”
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a “good person.”
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen said that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was “shocked.”
O’Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that he would not go to prison.
When the police reached Lambi on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and started running into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral dissertation on educational science at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a CV on the university's website.
The stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been struggling in recent years.
In 2001, he contracted leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Even if the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double fracture in his leg and he’s in the hospital now.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow, maybe a day after that, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
Oh, this is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's going to take at least six months for a double fracture, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got only a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, the words aren’t enough to tell how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I’m coming back stronger.”
Manchester United suffer from Luke Shaw’s case and lose to PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive for recovery in next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, “It’s a really bad injury.”
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend their opponents.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against the Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn something: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, the service for the holidays asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, Dr Seuss's The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message we haven’t seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added as the filling of the fairly short original text.
“In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, the boy Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey’s wish to see the right tree,” the text says and describes a love story not written by Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds like it was taken from a plot summary of a Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database website, starting with “The city of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the boy Ted hopes to win over the heart of the Audrey girl of his dreams.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-beating and needy Kerskanen, without caring for the short, mustache creature Lorax, who “speaks for the trees.”
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of missing out on the England team, but it was still a tough spot
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last 3-0 series loss will be repeated.
I wouldn't shut down a guest win.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but it involves good spiral players and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is a striker option, although he is unknown at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the forwards in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that the cricket players are judged based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's selection before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best factors in the choice.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the hitter will get to leave the mark.
Lyth were selected seven times for the national team, including Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a batsman I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given the same opportunity as anyone else before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a lot of thought about Moeen in the opening shot next to Cook, which would get an extra pitcher on the pitch, but we could keep four quicks, and I'm not against him.
I don't understand why a batsman couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first lattice, before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, little of what I've been involved with with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unembellished stats - hitting an average of 31, with a ball with 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers on offer and the selectors chose youngsters.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant in the games may turn out to be a stroke of genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball and brings with him both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of source to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is being rested in the one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even if not everyone agrees, coaches and chooses don't make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favour of the UK's departure from the EU (Brexit) could take the profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s half-baked renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems, even if it doesn’t take into account even the heartfelt Jeremy “Is it a yes or no?” Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the trade union confederation to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic buddy recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries do not want to most of them.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they win supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the UK’s EU tent – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they don’t care we leave then.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her actions before it goes to ruin in the same way that happened to Thatcher, who have been too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande will have a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may have a leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for selfie Britts, when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, a friend of mine, some such ministers may even be consciously planning to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
“The negotiations were an organized case” and “The re-negotiations had no relevance to the UK.”
The Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU-sceptic the allociats of the press are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing “EU direct bananas” while in Brussels as a correspondent in the early 90’s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-like rogues, foreigners hacking phones, and people whose domicile is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you'll have to give up bananas for a decoy, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself, as far as Cameron's renegotiation stunt is opposed. Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster House of Parliament on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-accepting Neil Kinnock's 80's boycott of the Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
However, although it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but no doubt to Andrew Marr, from whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully put, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the British Independence Party Ukip's war goal enthusiast and the fiercest nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary “Benn, but not a Benn fan,” Benn said on both radio and TV this week, when her inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn’s election to appoint John McDonnell as the finance secretary of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his father-in-law struggled on TV, trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in the government.
Hilary's efforts were more appealing.
But the fight for staying with ‘in any situation’ — Benn’s statement—wasn’t what McDonnell said, and not all of it, according to what Corbyn told the Peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of round-the-clock TV, and especially in the swirl of social media, which is a favorable breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the basic tour of McDonnell and Corbyn regarding EU membership (and being in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbling.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby will not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they have suspicious voters too) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England e-cigarette review
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones, sparked a 12-person meeting where some had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in acclaiming the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
This ‘milead’ report was published by PHE last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the “exceptionally shaky basis” of the PHE’s main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, a professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that the policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public expects the PHE’s claim “at the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinion on the disadvantages that are associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reportedly previously funded by Bristish American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also supported BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that he had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the industry.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE's Cigarette Director.
A study produced by the group “a lot of respects” is that there is a lack of “undisputed evidence of harm to the risks of most products and most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “so far, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said the claims made in the BMJ had been answered in the past.
He says, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who smoke their lifespans die of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease and smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds per year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we are meeting our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 executive said
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “give anything” to hits such as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said the licence fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcasting times against the most watched programmes of its competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC President Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried Channel 4 for six years to build a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programmes that would be clearly suitable for unsubsidized competitors,” Johnson told the Communications Committee in the House of Lords as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or, in the long term, it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not and do.
The Voice is broadcast at the most important time of transmission because they want to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I do not understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be financed even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of them and EastEnders is another, admittedly in-house.
To be honest, other channels would give you anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about the public service broadcast.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is badly on the hunt for viewership “because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it’s the best way to achieve long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular series remind of comments from former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s public service programmes “go to the BBC4, where the number of viewers can often not be measured, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then, in defense of 4 billion pounds of licence fee revenue, hypocritically state that ‘of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one watches’.”
They put them on a mission where no one will ever come to see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for those people for whom 150 pounds is big money, because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its early role of “informing, training and entertaining.”
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the example of Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and change the task to "inform, educate and entertain."
As far as the partnership questions are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which, according to him, are shown on television only a few, and to ally themselves with commercial companies so that all of these could be watched online.
‘Sound genetics’ enables the control of brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms that have genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
Impulses work by turning on genetically modified motion neurons with membrane ducts that react to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms show the functionality of a new method, named audio genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are led to the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that are present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To manufacture ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, microbubbles reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turn on the modified motion neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired spot inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus may make it possible to temporarily cause the affected human nerve cells to react to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements put the British arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's station fair.
Terrifying killer planes!
Ankle-crushing leg irons!
Grape bombs!
As well as electric stunning batons that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The joyful voice and the imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest gun fair is a sharp parody that Amnesty International produced to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive governments at Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in the London shipyard area.

With the separate campaign, many posters also appeared on the bus stops and metro trains, which required a more detailed introduction.
“Important information, Are you traveling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?” one asks, using London’s underground font and brand, with the DLR track becoming the image of the tank.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the station fair.
These 300 posters were made by artists whose works were exhibited at Banksy's Museum of Cruel Designs in Dismaland (a museum of cruel plans).
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters around London using the “Ad Space Hack Packs.” This is a six-pound pack of hex wrenches that, according to the collective, “get access to a third of the advertising space of the entire planet’s bus stops.”
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized ‘poster vandalism’.
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance front when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun store poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed more than 100 000 times over Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that the station fair wasn’t advertised at all — and there was an empty spot on ExCeL’s calendar at the time, too — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for shady corporation, but “it was more stopping to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation.”
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the UK government needs to take action and make sure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the station fair comes from the inside of ExCeL, when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that he received an order from the U.S. military for “the AT4CS RS launch from the shoulder.”
This includes a “unique pipe-betting warhead that exerts excellent effects behind the armor inside the target.”
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dormitory
It's been 11 years since, when I was unaware at the age of 19, I moved to a student dormitory. Back then, I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed - and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything that's nerve-wracking to the perfectly scary.
It’s tempting to talk: tell me where you’re from, whether you took a gap year and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because really it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA I can be found in my room”.
Take a breath.
And also help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they split the fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights and public places to spend time, but they are also the places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college while in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dorms are formed a culture of wandering from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now so that I can gather back the energy I spent when I was talking to you.”
Try to sense when your college friend is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When it came to knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student dorm that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you’re starting college in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate cupcake plate and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from the -50s.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your living partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat blobs are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk to your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adultly than my dorm guy who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noise so that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverb stew blazing the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music roar, locked their doors and left for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or, in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a dorm partner your future spouse, you team up, you'd break up, and then you'd see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense down.
In that exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between trick-or-treating and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be cancelled in no time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in the water glass, which you then put in the freezer, but don't attach their belongings with a blue sticker to the ceiling more than twice at most.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - The house, which was planned as a reception centre, was smeared in Salo
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students was carried out in Kitee in North Karelia on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not an accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but a sleeping quarter for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical Folk High School in Kitee.
The windows and walls of the folk high school's accommodation facilities were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation spaces, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, who is the responsible teacher of the youth social guarantee training at the Folk High School, there were approximately ten people in the building that was the target of vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was the weekend and the adult people are free to move, so some of them may have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The Folk High School has people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has a-status.
Some study in a basic adult education school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland Police are investigating the attack as damage and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for more than a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men are suspected to have been involved and had been travelling in a light-coloured car.
I think this is the weekend weekend afternoon for young people, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
On the wall of the hospital was drawn a swastika and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report was filed.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people who lived in the building.
The state will abolish the Y-train to Karjaa - the passengers in their snarl, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news indignated the passengers of the train in question at the Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the shutdown will hit the people of Siuntio, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the number of people is growing all the time and the working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but the political will - or the lack of it.
In the HSTV interview video, Bengtström says that he will come to the capital with a tractor.
There will also be train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main line will be combined into a new R-line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be discontinued.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will buy train traffic on the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year, and there will be routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be approved later by the Finance Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that a state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Let's make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's the remorse.
The Y train is also used by people other than the people of Raseborg and Siuntio, because it is fast and overrides several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It's exactly miserable for those who have to redesign their journey," he said as he climbed the Y train.
A little relief is on the way.
There will probably be a new train connection to the shoreline, replacing the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring more costs to HSL, i.e. in practice, the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million a year for the Y-train, of course the ministry much more than this.
The R-line on the main line will miss two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, on the other hand, the number of train services doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services will be reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made per year on the services to be discontinued, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crises of the global economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, the former chairman of the SKP, in his book The Topicality of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He will now be taken more seriously than he has in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessments of the development, internationalisation and intrusion of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly foresighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor and distinguished financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
However, the former Managing Director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Delegation to the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist, is he?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of the idea is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginning of capitalism too far, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman nevertheless sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are being discussed again.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to the one who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technical revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is of no help to Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
However, Marx is worth getting to know.
"In the 70's Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's world of thought - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The United Nations is calling for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency reported.
The UN report on the civil war of 1983-2009 came out on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
At least 100 000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The number of victims is not known.
In particular, the major military offensive in the final months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides have been involved in the murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
In the English exam, you could weigh in on social media
The autumn matriculation examinations included a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
More than 16 000 candidates tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write about the substance on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the essay on the 150-250 word in English could be addressed to the online magazine's helpline.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in line with Leelia's recliner.
He had to be asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the perspective of young people.
In total, there were four subjects of the substance, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo Upper Secondary School in Sweden.
The third issue was only a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, according to Lybeck, was quite nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, estimating the whole test as "quite normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test, you could answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer floe to climate change and the processing of large amounts of information.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish test, Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is arranged normally, which means that the protest by wage and salary earners does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can make it to the examination.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint
A shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando beanie.
He is a normal figure and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the unions of SAK, Akava and STTK meet at Rautatientori at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be taking part in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work, on the other hand, is not only to carry out the alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
The roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles for the period from 9.30 to 14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction from Mannerheimintie.
Is the Helsinki Police Department enough people, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that enough.
I do not comment on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell you the exact number of patrols.
"Some is coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging people to avoid driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With the protesters arriving from elsewhere in Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed to the Railway Square.
The buses are quite far away.
The rest of the way, you have to walk to the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary working people or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good point of comparison for it in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen from the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise its hands in front of the government," Siisiäinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also with points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip is on contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage and salary earners for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from different parts of Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration by the unemployed, the Transition Thursday held in 1993, says Siisiäinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the organized Puberty Thursday gathered together 20 000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (Centre Party) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as they were in the time of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of Puberty.
Besides, Finland's toughest bourgeois government will ever be in power now, says Siisiäinen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time of the throbbing, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close day-care centres and schools.
Although the protest does not receive the undivided support of wage and salary earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have taken place in Helsinki each year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement's demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the operating methods have become more intense in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990's brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on top of them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes for pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970's metal and electric strikes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70 000 metalworkers took part in the metalworkers' strike.
The strike was suspended with a proposal from the Reconciliation Committee after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metalworkers received a 16 percent raise.
The electricity strike in the spring of 1977 lasted 49 days and caused power outages around the country.
Transition Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of those who had made the recession unemployed, gathered in front of the Parliament House to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting venue.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually accelerated the negotiations to the result.
The doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - out of necessity," was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and prompted a lively discussion about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliament House in 2013.
The National Bureau of Investigation investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in determining the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on the cold truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees who had travelled in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died suffocating.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant operations and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for smuggling.
The refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
The rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book, The Travel Agency of Death, is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, present suggestions for solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of business.
HS introduces five of them.
I'll immediately beat them away
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another blaze with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as it seems to be.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going out on the water with lanterns extinguished at midnight.
On the first night, drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and throw up.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on a return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat the scumbers to death.
He says in the book that when the police once snarled him, he threw all his passengers across the board and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said his fellow countrymen had to be assaulted for this.
I'm gonna immediately beat them out.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is just a regular taxi driver in Bogovað, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running out and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving in the first place and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their family stay in tents, lean-to shelters and abandoned cars, which is what everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not filed an asylum application in Serbia.
Some people also stay in private residences, but it's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted by the envy - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða region, a large human smuggling hub, people are deadly.
The rides in Goran are predominantly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
"They'll say it once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He said the Africans are trying to bargain.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
A sleazy slob all the way.
First, for example, the price is agreed to be 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works at a lower price than the others and charges only 50 euros per person to the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most of it comfortably on the motorway.
They say colleagues are asking for a triple or four-time price.
Goran earns around 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a kilometre from the border.
Then he points to his customers in the right direction and hustles away.
Work of mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where a lot of believers from the Congo are visited, as well as a small centre where Congolese child refugees are helped.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the elastic band of the white underwear elegantly peeks from under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, off-road and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he arranges for people from the Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money carefully and slipping into the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from, for example, the war zones of northern Kivu, and that they have been forced to flee their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another will be purchased.
It is helped by the Missionary's contacts with the Ugandan Police.
After this, the customer is directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, finally to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He invoices for each step separately: submitting the application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, the management of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process to a European country, for example, 4 500-7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom's a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive the A26 on the highway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants, he's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck - you have to make sure that it's on its way to England, not the Netherlands, for example, and cuts off the safety cable of the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then it is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind of wrapping in the kitchen around a roast or baked potato.
It should prevent the police's thermal scanner from noticing the hideout.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that he won't drive any snug smugglers, at least not before the UK.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous people smugglers.
The rich Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who controls the maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990's and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money to get there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented for yachts to take American or European families on comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the vessels are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of 5 000-7 000 euros, first from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe by sea.
Customers are stored in human storage facilities, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers defecate and throw up, the better.
Küçük receives approximately 53 000 euros for one luxury vessel trip after the cost.
He does not take care of practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other lessers to take care of the work on their behalf.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought cover companies in the country, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Küçük was arrested simultaneously with a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he seems to have disappeared.

The American Olympic runner talks about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton talks about the termination of his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published snippets from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the race in top shape and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the finale, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line," Favor Hamilton said in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also spoke to her husband to accept.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
Another explanation for Favor Hamilton's involvement as a prostitute was that he needed the same kind of adrenaline rush as he had received when competing in athletics.
Favor Hamilton later discovered that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was number one in the world with a time of 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straightback"
Norway's ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
As in the summer and autumn, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wrangling over the athletes' contract.
Although the Federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by the two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union disciplined the ski rooster.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season for the national team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent the union, which will also take care of future generations and will not give one athlete in the solos.
At the same time, he pointed out that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug released its own statement on Tuesday, in which he assured that he would like to play sports in Norway's colours next season, as well as in the World Cup and then at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, two of them gold.
He was part of the team that won the relay gold in Falun last winter.
The Frying Turners' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E. 25.9. there will be events in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Frying Turners' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the significance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a sign of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the shield restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, which will be held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: A complaint to the Chancellor of Justice about the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-founding a refugee reception centre in the Kauhava ex-garrisus facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently based on the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to the Kauhajoki newspaper, the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in connection with the area and the airport of the former Air Force Academy, the impact of which has also not been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The article states that negotiations have taken place for the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, for example, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Arto Räty, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence.
A private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of objecting to the reception centre in principle, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Control means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to the journalists in the evening after meeting the chairs of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concern about the management of the refugee situation brought together all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland the government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
Especially in these times, when we have big challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched on in the discussions.
The president did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to manage the operations of the airports during the work stoppage by supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of Helsinki city centre.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars around 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Cars are not allowed from the direction of Mannerheimintie in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the lockdown time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told STT about the matter in the evening.
The majority of Alkos closes for two hours, including closed mail
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti's services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, for the delivery of day mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross' blood transports are carried out despite the strike.
The aim is also to carry out meal deliveries and hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information about the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Alkos in Finland will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery store employees to take part in the demonstration by trade unions.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open, if necessary, by supervisors.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki's daycare centres will not operate in their entirety on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Department announces.
Due to the demonstration of the trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in daycare centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
Round-the-clock day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for children with intellectual disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education Agency promises to announce more changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the channels among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks will become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be forwarded on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then we will see.
This channel is now being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio talk to citizens.
This whole thing, which we are talking about now, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it on Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech will not indicate a more general government inward turn.
Is the aim to take the right to define public debate more strictly in one's own hands and refuse the questioning of public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen from Stockholm University.
It reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not interconnected.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not notification issues in a democracy.
By definition, it is the task of the media representatives to try not to take the agendas of politicians when given.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more available today that we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labelled as a media for politicians or the Parliament and the Government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or the general policy.
Sipilä's clever bet
Sipilä's upcoming speech also means what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should take a close look at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, the TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, because this way he can bring out his own view without gravel noises.
This will get the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä ignores the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because more detailed questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuutti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether the sweat is running, whether the hands are trembling.
He compares Sipilä to the father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his associates regularly do.
Really exceptional
Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
Employees' organisations will hold a demonstration on Friday and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration of the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (SD), announces that he will challenge Sipilä to the dialogue.
This is not time for monologues.
Soon six months from the election.
You can't hide endlessly, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
THE BOY HAS BEEN FOUND AND IN ORDER, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks everyone who helped me in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by violent youth craze: You can cause anger
MMA fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted the video on Facebook, which appeals especially to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against the street fights of young people.
Born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family, Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family, has so far won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC series of the MMA.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the fad of young people.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on someone else, and sniffing blindly without thinking about the consequences of this, as you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrants and native Finnish young people have uploaded videos of the fight to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting on the street at all.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, reminds Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani reminds that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a lot of these isolated incidents.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for letting you be here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get subjected to some kind of racism, you can blame yourself.
Think a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that the violent action will put a contribution to racism.
You can make me hate what I don’t like either.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you won't improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK's Chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will discuss its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the trade union organisation STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the Government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party).
Akava's Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation, SAK, soften its previous position.
SAK's Chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter in a small way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of compulsory laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's Government's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the five per cent productivity leap goal.
Comment: The big demonstration threatens to slump - "It feels a bit funny to threat your fist"
After all, it feels a bit funny to threat your fist if you already have a fitting paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary in the employee camp.
Is it to call for the government to overturn or do we agree with it?
On Monday, the union leaders of SAK spoke of holy hatred towards the government of the republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being shut.
The ugetion spread to the Akava people.
Teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (SD), Chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Employees (STTK), performed in a conciliatory manner.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party).
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder (National Coalition Party) immediately rushed to announce that his match-fix paper is already ready.
At first, there was not a peep from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (SD) is difficult to agree when the union leaders just on Monday told them to stand the country on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for the joint proposal of wage and salary earners to be made, SAK should agree to accept the five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palolan STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's Board of Directors.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Influencing at STTK, previously served as a special adviser to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the board's trade union expertise has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, Palola's exit took a bit of a boost away from the Finnish solter, whose figurehead is ACP's Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a bit funny to threat your fist if you already have a fitting paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian State Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the jubilee meeting in Helsinki in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting - a matter on which the President was able to remind journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation entered Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to sniper at Finland by praising and praising Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be an obstacle.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalition Party), who, according to Russian media, who has already discussed the Russian delegation in Ulan Bator.
Lock faces real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Tappara and Lock will continue the bull days in Hakametsä today, when both will be on fire on the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today in Hakametsä we will not see the actual goal celebrations.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2 overtime win over KalPa.
The climb was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was a more minor victory.
The Blues, who started the catch of the Rauma residents tangled, had a round zero point as a guest, and a 2-3 loss score.
A tough game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lukko striker Janne Lahti anticipates the situation on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
Tappara has dropped out of the final series in the semi-finals in the previous two seasons.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lukko took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three in the next three to the chest and past.
There are no major changes in the group line-ups, with the exception of goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute shift today.
With Tappara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: A lousy play running in the aces
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a film about Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put on a sensational battle with world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The nameless and wood-covered patapakka progressed to everyone's surprise in the Finnish Championship finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but resilient underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Matti from Pori and Pele Peltonen.
In the playoffs, the players stained their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
A great TV commentator, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the silver won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the Aces' sporting director has built a pack of snails on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than a puck game.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the lead role in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has named Rautakallio Sean Conner.
Rautakallio is as awkward as Connery in the original 1976 work in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There's nothing in Iron Rock except Rocky's nickname.
Rautakallio's game philosophy does not include rushing and pigging.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, the Aces' Garret Stafford tackled Tappara's Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
Only those who deserve to play with us.
I don't accept a game like that and it doesn't belong in the ace hockey, Rautakallio, who was hot after the game, was snarled at the Satakunta People.
The team of the Aces this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, police officers, and ups.
There are practically no key men in the prime.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect the acquisitions and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite narrow, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smoulder under the surface.
Rautakallio, the 1953 model, is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports boss.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
The Aces' balance in the three league games of the season is the same number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's direction for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanta's film "Teit Kaunis from Us" is in the film The Mother of Drummer Sipe Santapukki Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports his son, although his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had already met Sirkka before the film project, but since then the two have converged a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been texting.
Sirkka has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of their history from different angles.
Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the 90's it was a recession and really bleak.
There was a pretty small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirkka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Heinola's notorious skateboarder Tuukka.
Olga was a good everyday and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with the film Tuukka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has cooperated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that he is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always been super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple, who lives in Iitti, often intend to drive home for the night because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, just asked which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive drama film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, the sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, will become the most expensive drama film of all time in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is underway, will also surpass Iron Sky 2, with the film's budget of more than 100 million euros.
The filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October near Antwerp at the AED Studios premises and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I've been so relaxed!
I'm feeling so relaxed about the script, because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he tells Iltalehti.
Initially, the film's budget was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big story.
However, you could shove 100 million into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that there is no slack.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond on Wednesday, which pays an annual interest rate of 4 to 8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
A hick or a cool one?
Big logos go back to the shirts
The chests of the Trendsetters have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The promotion of the brand of the hoodie or t-shirt was seen as a bit of a hick.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike that have risen to the crest of the coolness.
And as so often before, the line between the funny and the trendy is blurred: if something is already a real hick, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or ordinary fashion, in which the trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way to stand out from the mass.
Instead of a basic grey sweatshirt, we're already wearing the sweatshirt that was buried at the bottom of the closet, and the manufacturer's logo is on top of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas's recognizable tracksuits, the favourite team's jerseys and the New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underwear that start to peek at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace's autumn blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to show the logos on your dress?
Russian politician posted evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the alleged, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhny Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo, which showcases products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove the large Zotovia from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, in which he seems to peek through the door of an armoured vehicle in a very good mood, and at least based on those pictures, it is not about getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battle tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian army's TV channel, Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and sturdy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen," he told the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stuck have been published, even though a total of 50 000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started in the beginning with a block of the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to have struggled out of the tank door while trying and finally threatened to shoot everyone around him unless he got out of his head.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition shared their own view of the incident.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his big size, simply lingered when he came out.
But by no means did he sit there for five hours, said the show's coordinator, Alexander Pisarevsky, to Bloknot.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
After the Kultakaivos purified process water has leaked from the so-called tailings pond into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have begun.
The pool contains neutralized tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, the water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, in accordance with the permit, is directed through the surface drainage field to the environment.
The estimated number of leaks was approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to carry out comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire agreement system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of a positive message for the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomat.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be carried out as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new forecast, Danske anticipates that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have been based on the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
On the other hand, less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who died of cancer in July, will begin work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as possible successors of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda.
Kimishima's task is to take Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
The Swedish Immigration Service already recognized in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have entered the country are lost every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants are disappearing in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Officer at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation in Finland the same?
How many applicants will disappear in a year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were submitted in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
They disappeared 9.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be due to the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Correspondingly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were subject to a decision to lapse because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
This year, by 6.9., we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
There are no overall statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers missing this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and it has clearly increased, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have received a deportation decision?
Are they also disappearing into the "black market"?
This is difficult for the Finnish Immigration Service to assess, as the police is responsible for the enforcement of deportation decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU's meeting of interior ministers, told about practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
Timo T.A., a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to seizures. Mikkonen's equipment used for TV and radio productions is now for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net that was once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, a large number of devices have been left behind by technological development.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interests.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and the builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen reflects to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen aims to move away from his current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've slowly started to take a look at what things are being given up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to become more common than expected: Metro and trams could stop all Friday
The drivers of the subway and trams will decide today whether to expand the power measures related to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly stinging drivers, so the government's plans to cut allowances are a source of opposition.
Hirvonen reflects that stopping traffic for the whole day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport will practically be almost completely at a standstill in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
According to VR's information, the trains will not run between 6am and 6pm on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departed before 6am will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL's information, most of the buses will remain in the depot.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday, from three in the morning to three o'clock on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by supervisors, HSL's spokesperson Pirkko Repo says.
Repo says that HSL cannot say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a large demonstration at Helsinki's Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, according to the AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thought self-made watch was a bomb
Ahmed Mohamed, 14, of Texas, has been arrested after a teacher saw the self-made watch he brought to the school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed into the youth detention cell.
Mohamedin has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the clock looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is stored by the police, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic council wonders whether the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain shocks Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by MPs from Corbyn's own labour party.
This has offended the public, said Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and emphasizes that he has paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We are all indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silently during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
There are those who fear that he will deport moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity measures and the increase in public spending.
Today, for the first time, Mr Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament as a party leader during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should be asked.
Cameron announced on Twitter the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing is still unclear - a lawsuit awaits the father of the family
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of the children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead from all over the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful business
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, the police chief of South Lake Minnetonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloody acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 Interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors every week.
I have been made 50 takeover offers from the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a magnificent house from Greenwood for two million dollars in 2011.
The house is advertised in the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was awaited by a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, had sued her for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, No slanderous comments had been removed from the Short website and had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the trotting event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her honorable board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo beat Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loiri, the success horse's trainer Korpi gets full peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri snarled.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest athlete's greatest donation of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated 10 million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest ever single donation by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his annual earnings of nine million dollars.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space named after the hospital.
The Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly before.
Jean Beliveau, a long-time captain who passed away a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among other things, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer examinations.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening - just serve a bikini and an apron
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the sick and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for yourself from the Tokyo-based Ore no Yome café.
It's a waiter who pretends to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is just wearing an apron and bikini, while her husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates, all the way to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a statement released by Intel.
The committee consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of the best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will update the report based on ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, President of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected for years as the moon is rising.
The car is finally in sight in Finland.
Ford announced the RS's information now that the car world is watching at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new all-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a maximum speed of 266 km/h.
Interestingly enough, the price is also interesting, preliminary it is said to be 52 000 euros.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in its press release.
The favourite brand Kia presented two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish terms, the new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two novelties, with which Kia intends to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage, led by the new European Design Director Gregory Guillaume, is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and the exterior dimensions have been one centimetre here and there and the car is crossing the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly the same, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More information about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be announced closer to the sale.
We'll have to wait a bit longer, because we'll have a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimas arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a brand new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
Optims with a 1.7-litre turbo diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine are available.
Next summer, the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine will accelerate.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima station wagon begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - blasped in a bold overallsuit
Singer Chisu is participating in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a striking, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the singer's graceful waist.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has lost her pregnancy weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and getting in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really nervous.
I’ve missed everything to do with music, the singer says.
Chisu will release their new and fourth album, Polaris, in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired me to write new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is stunned again - now you can see the chest
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics of conversation one after the other.
She shows off her pregnancy belly and chest in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock in America's time, when she left her husband Kanye West's gig with her sister Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress is transparent for the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flashes flicker.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity outfit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The accessory was highlighted by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the pregnancy belly was on display.
The tough laws of the modeling world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to straighten out the idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean of the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you have posed for the costumes of top designers in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with the veterans.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where the fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
Agent in New York might ask you to drop the pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
At Fashion Week, models and designers are always together, and at the same time they serve as a support network.
When Fashion Week ends, the difference is wistful.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors who have a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers will unveil their next year's collection.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown musician Apulanta in the film
Roope Salminen will play Antti Lautala, the band's founding member, in a film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a big challenge for me, because I'm almost a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the photo shoot, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to impersonate a person.
The man who leads Roope Salminen and Koirat will not take the role.
Punk mannerisms come naturally, according to the man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many people saw a foretaste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been petty, but we always go to the fullest.
The main actors of the film Teit Kaunis, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apula in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is still played by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki will be played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo from bassist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip on his future position already last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, seen in the whisker and chin, has shaved his face with smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to bring it up by force, advises Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR's crisis team.
It is worth protecting smaller children, and not, for example, let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they are seeing, and it can be remembered and distressed, he says.
However, if a child has come across news photos of refugees on television or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is a good idea to have a conversation on the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that a parent thinks he is afraid of.
It is not worth scaring the child in vain, even if you are anxious and afraid of yourself.
A smaller child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
Older children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is a good idea for parents to bring up the matter with them if the matter concerns the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can think together with the children about how we feel about this in our family.
In the end, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult issues, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come up in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
Vermo's Ball Lightning Difficult to Control
Perttu Pohjola managed to grind the fire of Apila's Ball Lightning in midsummer.
It was just winning and second place, until at the end of July there was a collapse in the Tampere races.
Since the stallion froze thoroughly, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for the exhaustion was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Because Apila's Pallosalama had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE-mare in Turku in its record time after Taruntuuli.
Apila's Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it could have been driven normally for only a few weeks.
Considering those things, a small bending at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made the stallion a bit of a blade.
The horse's tune certainly went forward from it, and I hope it would have leveled out as well.
Apilan Pallosalama has been a so-called humorous horse.
When you haven't felt like it, you can throw it fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has become such a flash that the opponents have been amazed.
In short-term speed, the co-rivals are not able to cope with the Ball Lightning, which even looses warm-blooded rides.
Pohjola hopes for a nest run in Vermo.
However, the difference is how Apila's Ball Shalam agrees to it.
It's quite difficult at the time of departure and you might even tweak the starting car from under the boom and such.
I hope the stallion is calmer than leaving Turku.
Apila's Pallosalama is also able to come from the bow when he is in shape, and we will start driving it for victory, the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, said Tim Cook, the company's CEO, in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a number of apps that are relatively used by relatively few: For example, FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems on the top.
Some apps are linked to another on iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook didn't mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation waned to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the EU-wide 28 countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The most euro countries, or 1.4 per cent, of consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus-marked according to the EU's Harmonised Price Index.
Eurozone inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a two per cent price increase over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy
The next U.S. recession will begin in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the Fed again begins to raise interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession may hit the fastest by next autumn and the price of the financial markets before that.
Or at least, if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they used to, and if they react to the blackmail of the Fed's money taps, as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle survey.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report, which exceeded 60 pages, to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations in the economic statistics to explain how the economy and markets have previously behaved during and after the Fed's interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or another model as in the time of the previous interest rate hikes - and what is possibly coming from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shaky state to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession
The leaders who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its current tuning have hinted throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years could come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Executive Board meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That's when the series of relatively regular, but at a time, small interest rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points ended, with which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis burst into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than has typically happened after the previous Fed's interest rate hikes.
Correspondingly, the trials were then harder and more harsh than at any time since the 1930's recession.
Deutsche's strategists have been screening the rises and declines of the world's largest economies and the turn of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
They have been explaining the Fed's interest rate hikes and their economic and financial impact since the 1950's.
It has taken less than a year since the first rate hike to the recession started, usually less than three years and, on average, less than three and a half years.
The rise in the price of the financial markets has ended within one year or two of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately lowered its policy rate after the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has differed from the others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively scarce, so it is unlikely that anyone can be deduced from the effects of the following interest rate hikes.
The strategies remind us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be found out unquestionably, even through decades of research.
But three points for the causes of the crisis and the increment of its destructive power are probably somewhat undeniably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long in the 2000s.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time increased the following.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and already too high grew even greater due to the over-loose monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the previous economic history was created.
3) In particular, the almost uncontained crazy-cheap debt financing of the financial markets inflated the largest exchange rate bubbles in the previous economic history, from equities to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly a fierce controversy, either, that the financial markets that rose to the heights of the increasingly complex leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state, when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures set on the leverages, let alone the valuation bubbles, lasted only after the start of the interest rate hikes and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
A bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give reason for thinking, for example, by mentioning the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept the stance of their monetary policy even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been crazy cheap for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now the debt burden in different parts of the economy is a lot heavier than before or in the past in the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity, which has been issued more than ever and cheaper, has largely remained in the financial markets and has taken the key securities and asset classes to the most expensive, whether at or never at the pre-financial crisis.
And the strategists aren't just dampening the mood with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy hasn't yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades, as has happened in the past.
The eurozone economy has scarcely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks in the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the future of the French bank Societe Generale's strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it can seem.
He has for some time been coaching the Bank's international investor customers to the Fed's following complete translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to extinguish the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's corporate service side, the company said.
HP will be distributed in November by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had a maximum number of employees in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the number of personnel had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-recurring costs of 2.7 billion dollars (about 2.4 billion euros) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The consumer reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than ten per cent of its operating result.
The year before last, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for iPhone after Apple's update release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking “General” and then selecting “Software Update”.
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation after a “Software Update Failed” error message appeared on the screen.
To skip this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic jam to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get the status, but Apple has reduced this by reducing the size of the update and also eased the process with a new tool that suggests uninstallable apps, and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the update, so that you don't run out of battery.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, as if the battery runs out, it could lead to an update break.

Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre Party) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he has submitted his resignation in May this year.
I checked it out and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg are through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership at the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner.
This is the owner of Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upfloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland, and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not subject to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
A reception centre maintained by the company will open in Espoo
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers maintained by the company will open in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first hundred residents from 6pm onwards.
The number of seats may increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre on the former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's labour market blackmail.
The organisation also hopes that other employee central organisations will participate.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of labour will then return.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out during the meeting of the organisation's administration to journalists during a break.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not prepared for discussions.
The economists of STTK have calculated that the change security included in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the other half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if the party has a lot of enthusiasm to have a conversation if there's one relationship to a hundred on the receiving side.
Palola: The negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is scheduled to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the board exists, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
According to Palola, the cut in Sunday supplements is a painful place for the Central Union of Staff (STTK).
The organization requires the government to back down from mandatory legislation, with which it would be implementing some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP, which raised the issue.
On Friday, wage and salary earners will meet in Helsinki to oppose the working life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary for the first few days of illness is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 per cent and holidays are shortened.
STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited wage and salary earners to the demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise the strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
Akava's Chairman Sture Fjäder praises STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same page as Akava, as Akava has been outlining an alternative model for government proposals for the long term.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that Lauri Lyly's leadership will join us in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the five per cent competitiveness jump sought by the government as an alternative to the cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will suit the government and employers in the country, says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 o'clock to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, shared coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
Bingo ticket for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä revolt and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When seeking a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio address, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä revolt.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990's, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped the train operators' strike with a televised speech.
A monologue, a monarchist vibe
Sipilä's speech has attracted all-day criticism and guesswork about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration of the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens' Ville Niinistö, "there has already been a single call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned on Facebook that "the monarchist spirit: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Smare six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
Tried is.
What is @Juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK's Chairman Lauri Lyly and CEO of EK Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and found that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle's Publications, in Yle's News.
Like us in the time of the Tammelos
The speech has also sparked scorns.
When the evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed for the best.
Mom puts on a prettier cot and Dad fits the tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, we will quiet down to the TV as in the old days of Me Tammelot," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why millionaires who hide their capital in tax havens in tax havens, who draft amnesty laws for their other tax-evading friends and at the same time tell the people that they have to cut the money when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted the attached bingo on Facebook.
Can we hear about the same boat, the common coal, debts of living and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan to elegantly recede al-Assad after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral discussion: the opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and al-Assad had to immediately be spoken to, and the abdication of Al-Assad had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Chhurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said that sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he forwarded the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time, and key opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have had in power with.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East branch of the British Foreign Office, has hesitation about Ahtisaari's speeches, because in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke on the Moscow mandate.
If he had told me what Mr Churkin had said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it was Putin's gimmick to keep the power of some Al-Assad supporter.
The Refugee Stream of Our Own Actions
During the negotiations, about 7 500 people had been killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the invoice that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Asylum Seekers' Organizing Centre in Tornio
The Government's asylum setter centre planned for Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in a building in the town centre of Tornio, which is empty.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to get the flow of refugees from the Swedish border better.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice Chairman of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not meeting and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he specified to STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the discussion.
The centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on this, one could expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted to quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could fit in the joint lyceum at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, too, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party), the halving of holiday bonuses in public would only take care of part of the government's desire to lower the price of labour.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a package.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for alternative measures for the labour market blackmail announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's opinion, halving holiday bonuses would serve as a means, because it would target almost all wage and salary earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on the cut in holiday bonuses, because they are included in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will now tell Parliament on Wednesday next week about the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work then starts to move, i.e. the train is on the move and it is becoming more and more difficult.
It's a good time now.
It won't be long before this kind of thing, if there's the will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Ascension Thursday into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first days of illness are cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 per cent and holidays are shortened.
The reforms will be carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The central organisations of wage and salary earners will hold a large demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi council approved the expansion of the sap hall's warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved, but slightly murmured, the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, i.e. the storage of the sap hall.
The review was prompted by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally said.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago, when we decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the inventory by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
The agenda was still discussed on the agenda for an investment of 150 000-200 000 euros, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at 300 000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it will bring work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Place in the Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its earlier strong position on bringing street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in mind the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it, and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more of a part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared for the use of the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worthwhile to be open-minded about the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still the special characteristics of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of them can be used in the county's many kinds of marketing.
Disabling train connections will cut the province's vitality
The cuts in train connections hit the county's vitality with a heavy hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And it does affect whether we can live and work here in the first place, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, the continuation of which has also been under consideration on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that our chances of not being able to reduce the power's actions, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it will be to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment it is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, because the transport connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, on the other hand, about 10-20 per cent are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu made one gravel sound for Siun sote
The Joensuu City Board's view of the regional Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel voice among them.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board, proposed the resignation of the entire project at the Board's meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Board approved the decision proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of trains.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains will be left out, but you can still get from Kotka to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase money for train traffic for the next four-year period will be reduced by 12.3 million euros.
The quietest routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck out of the place
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbed on the roof, who could not get down from the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder on the roof.
That didn't stop the group of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the others snuck out of the scene and passers-by alerted the rescue department to help safely back to the ground with the last tromp ladder.
FedEx's operating profit twofold, lowers outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its most recent quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services and higher costs of its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May with a profit of US$10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting 10.84 dollars, according to a survey by FactSet.
The smaller outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on January 4, and despite the higher surcharges on land transport of heavy or large packages that began in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “will perform steadily taking into account the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
Plans for the payouts for the holiday were announced the day after the contestant UPS said he plans to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx's profit was US$692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share came at 2.42 dollars, which remains from the 2.44 dollar average forecast. The 12 analyst survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
In a Zacks poll, six analysts expected 12.23 billion dollars.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport that has halted the development of the revenue of its Express unit.
However, the rise of the online store has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the most recent quarter, the country unit's net sales increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from the operations was basically the same due to the high cost of larger packages and own insurance.
The revenue of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations was lowered by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell US$3.85, or 2.5 percent, to US$150.15.
FedEx closed the 11 percent down this year on Tuesday and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, U.S. central bank decision-makers are sitting around a huge mahogany table for a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chairman of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
Congress has put two of the central bank's shoulders: they need to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Deal of Recession, the central bank's leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that could be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. A decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from a record incentive that the short-term interest rate that has remained at almost zero since late 2008 has brought .
While the majority of the data show a steady increase in the economy, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made bank officials on alert in advance even more frightened when it comes to increasing instability. It is feared how it would be if the federal funds rate were increased by even a percentage point quarter.
“Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I believe that if they seek the justification for rescheduling interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a valid enough reason to wait,” he said.
No agreement has been reached on the central bank's decision, which also creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the drawdown, as according to the key indicator, the opportunity to grow is only about 30 per cent.
This indicates a decline in the securities markets if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was brought with it by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, according to John Lonski, the main economic expert of the Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they have to put a lot of effort into their policy to support the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates this month by a quarter of a percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of a pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's annual target of 2%, according to the central bank's decision-makers, the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the significantly lower oil price.
The economy “can survive higher interest rates and also need them, given the tight situation in the labour market,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell as much as 16 percent from its May record, with investors fearing that China would slow the economy slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, the turmoil in the market is an additional factor in the complex equation, which indicates when interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still rather unclear, and they have little information at their disposal regarding the consequences of China’s events,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, then chairman, Ben S. Bernanken, a hint that the central bank can “narrow” the increase in the amount of money caused upheavals in the markets around the world.
In a world where the market and economies are increasingly weaved, central bank officials are expected not only to follow the development elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, this month, pointed out that “the central bank has previously overreacted to a financial market movement that has appeared to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a member of the committee's right to vote, as an example, appeals to the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings “despite its limited, recognizable impact on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should put economic stability first only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Pose, former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Determination Committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen says.
“No one wants to be in a situation where there is a fear of raising interest rates because the market is upset,” said Posen, chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still includes a two-way requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's Pediatric Association Rio Grandesa promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeders
The Brazilian Pediatric Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by posting pictures of babies absorbing breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing the number of calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study, led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
The Seven Channel's Sunrise program is a favorite in terms of number of viewers, despite Nine's attempts to report a revelation of a leader on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's revelation of leaders failed to increase the number of viewers at Today.
The morning show on Nine was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull derailed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The baggage of the distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average viewership was 397 000 in five state capitals, compared to Today's figure of 339 000.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317 000) and last Tuesday's (283 000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318 000 and Sunrise's was 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise's average is 349 000 spectators, while Today's figure is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds will blow this morning outside of Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The big news from the Seven channel was the 800 words series featuring the astonishing premiere of former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
A new drama series that attracted a fairly impressive average of 1.219 million viewers tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson will be the driving force behind the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
The Seven-channel's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838 000) and the TBL Families (726 000).
The Seven channel had a twofold fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O’Keefe attracted an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer average was 520 000 viewers, and in the second half-hour the figure was a whopping 720 000.
The average for the Hot Seat was 620 grand.
The Chase Australia's second-night average decline brings confidence to the Nine channel that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's program.

The finalist agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who would win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret, with which Sam Wood ends up in the convention in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are definitely not slipping who got the last rose.
However, when we were talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women threw themselves into poetics as a man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as the reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?”, their answers may have provided a revelation about who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of (Sarahin) and the energies of Sam felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is really down-to-earth, it’s fun to be around her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week’s home visits made him realize that Wood could be “the one.”
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game – I’m now with all my heart in this,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was a mystery.
“I don’t know if I can say,” he said.
I like the girls left just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Thursday at 19:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in moving to the United States, and many other teams have been asking him after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kick-off in his return, with Minnesota winning 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next fly-kick and took him on the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula's true nature was also evident in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new arrivals a spade in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne knocked out a flight kick that the Minnesota Vikings snatched in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for for his NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on the way from the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“It was just one of these things, I just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when an assist in his own goal area led Queensland to a goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo posted on her Instagram account with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun, threatening a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed police firing rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in a crowd protesting against the country's new draft constitution, the official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's senior official, said more than 1000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous option, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's South Plains, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there is a 60% chance of a cyclone on the south side of Cape Verde
On a wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde group of islands, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second attentive low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based Weather Forecast Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise US$11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise US$11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee the war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it launched the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of a report being made by a manager, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
“Our trip included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations will be received by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would respond with the same amount to every donation made worldwide on Google.com/refugeerelief up to US$5.5 million, with a total target of US$11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to Syria's four-year civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese people with diabetes
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetes can take at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
“It takes a long time to get mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the subjects in the study have been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight ratio to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is more than 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, for the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cuts decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of people treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same in 29.
Of the people undergoing surgery, 36% had diabetes completely and 28% partially.
For comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely cured by only 1 percent and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgery group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 percent, the researchers wrote.
The post-operative hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8 per cent.
However, this better ‘glycemic control’ described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, said lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the group that underwent gastric reduction surgery, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered their body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), lowered their haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where the surgery led to a longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had undergone weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the surgery.
“The research results are crucial precisely because they show that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group,” he said.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take the weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he said.
I believe that when a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
“Not everyone can come to Europe” – Dalai Lama – RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the homeland of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK. The center is dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples, or even continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response from the U.S. caused the chain's violent events.
“After the 9/11 attack, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in the letter and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” Lama said.
Over the past four years, swallowing of children's hand disinfectant has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a sharp increase of nearly 400 percent in the swallowing of alcohol-containing hand disinfectant for children under the age of 12 after 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Information Centre.
According to Gyalord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poison Information Centre, the cases of swallowing of disinfectant intoxicant reported to poison information centres for children under the age of 12 rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are put on call,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap climb.
According to reports, the teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
“The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are those with the added scent.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain alcohol from any 45 and 95 percent to.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few squirts.
“It’s really condensed alcohol,” said Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital’s Poison Control Center.
So please don't leave the whisky shot lying on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who, some time ago, swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of drunk driving for adults, according to first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and forbids it from his class.
The police consider the plan to be prevented as ‘idle nonsense’ and leave the disciplinary measures to the school district.
Rumor mill: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths disregards the contradictions of Celtic, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn
Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard for January's recruits that could disrupt the team's unity
The Dons increased their lead to Celtic by five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team a chance to increase the gap to Celtic by five points.
Griffiths downplays the contradictions
There have been rumours of Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under closer scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch league leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship is bored by the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said, “The Dutch are no longer showing the highlights of Celtic’s games and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and not only Scots want to follow those games as well.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League quickly followed a loss to Aberdeen, who has played with ten men, who is now at the top of the league with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, “Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we’re going up again.”
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard for January transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets of the January transfers, he is on guard for a recruitment frenzy, assuring him that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For the players coming in the summer, the time for the reconciling time is the entire period preceding the season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales this summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, losing 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson stays behind what he said, saying, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on the performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was scolded for acquitting to sing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburg derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “It’s safe to say I’m not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to play for Celtic.”
Tannadice's Board of Directors Believes Dundee United's Lead - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's board of directors still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back in shape,” Donnelly says.
McInnes happy about the ‘ugly victory’ in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging on to the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve their seventh consecutive league win, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty, lifting them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There isn’t a single team that would have won anything, whether it’s a trophy or a league that wouldn’t have won games like this.”
Unemployment among Scots remains the same as the UK's integer grows
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164 000 during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by a total of 1.82 million people.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than that of the UK 5.5 per cent, according to the National Statistics Finland (ONS) figures.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I witness the execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will see a man execution later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the spectator's gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approached.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available seats, participants are selected through a dreadful draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever chooses, watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through phone calls made over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pencil with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused on Twitter that I had compromised my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he or she likes, and you will be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that “could have set his words better”, but still thinks what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I should write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said.
I've told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international journalist present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, is by my side.
If you want to know more about the article, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I think there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view from which I watch him die.
I cannot claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like dies unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police yacht
The Canning Vale officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water, just metres away from the policeman, who tried to “gently attract him back to the beach.”
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for an unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
“He was standing in the water saying ‘I’m not coming away, come get me,’” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: “proper police negotiations.”
“Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned their car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed to succeed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's officials tried to infiltrate his furrows in his stables last year, and threatens to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the agents and the Racing Victoria incorrorability division, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to a treatment on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has found himself in a difficult situation after Lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check with his spy dissertations for a year and a half, and did not want “it to look jealous.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that everything erupts at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I should never continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said that the infiltration department had tried to spy on his team.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man—I name him when asked—and offered him a job at my stables if he cares about what I’m doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, of course they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the matter at the time and will be aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps transfer responsibility to non-coaches about what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think that.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I'm saying now will possibly make them think about it.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really saddens me.
I'm putting pressure on them to make the decision they're responsible for.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has grown with a long-term study of Lidar’s cobalt, and a late rejection led him to realize that he could “throw his license across the table.”
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment procedure rule “ridiculous” after putting a mud or clay bath on the horse’s legs, which is irregular.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could have had a bath last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the brave treatment on the day of the competition, from which the officials began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram driver who was involved in a road flight
Police have arrested a man who was involved in a traffic run after colliding with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
A cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after sustaining serious injuries when a car collided with him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with non-stop in an accident, neglect of assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team’s tackles are part of the “lineup.”
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on their side when they unexpectedly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to Storm after defeating the North Queensland Cowboys in the final qualifier on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not "very enthusiastic" about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team’s tackles and said they’re just focusing on “contacting” when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by the criticism of the two leading coachs for Stormi, which means they are afraid of losing to the team.
“This always comes up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year. Over the past six weeks, we've only been putting attention on the contact on tackles, and that's made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of “exciting rugby” by reminding his mentor that Bennett’s coach St George Illawarra Dragons won the title in 2010 by playing “boringly.”
Wayne talks about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell you how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought up that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
I'm going to be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more point-rich than the one played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting defensive line and not score?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is out this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man guarantees 200 grand for drug charges
The man, who is threatened with a life sentence for a possession attempt of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, has been released against a bail of US$200 000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after a federal police officer tracked down 100 pounds of drug to a Solay yacht who came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting with other defendants in the marina throughout the morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 pounds of the drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is facing a potential life sentence for a business-related cocaine possession attempt, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
“He has close links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a deposit of US$200 000 to secure her release.
“After reading the sworn certificates of both individuals, it is clear that setting a deposit of US$200 000 is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to the police on a daily basis and upholds his curfew between six in the evening and six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communication service, where Hogg received numerous promiscuous photos of the children that the other user sent to him.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When they arrived, the police saw five pictures, searched the computers on the scene, and found “worrying” web searches with keywords used to search for promiscuous images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done this “to attract paedophiles” on the Internet before he “pretended to be a police officer to scare them.”
Eilidh Robertson, a Fiscal depute representative, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: “He said it’s an addiction — that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on the computer but said that they had been done just because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, and when Hogg asked the person to send more pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that after drinking, he's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of the rapes and the murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shaked and cried.
Mom saw the promiscuous photos on the phone and then confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking photos of promiscuous children on June 14 last year. He breached his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to come to court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be entered in the sex offenders’ register, claiming that his crime did not include a “significant sexual element.”
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the verdict until October so that the social services have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the Sex Offenders Register before the date of the conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him in the middle of a speech to parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group discipline supervisor of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages to their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the title of the message is ‘death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the members of the matter that immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “worried” about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will be split into two listed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer businesses from faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about 2.7 billion dollars in expenses starting from the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual revenue will be more than US$50 billion, and it “focuses on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
Jako breaks up the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a graduate of Stanford University, founded in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage located in Palo Alto, called “The Birthplace of Silicon Valley”.
HP has undergone a huge reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that tightly limited companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb's draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it's only September and that he's going to be in his rehabilitation as planned, there's no reason why he wouldn't be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season started.
“This kind of injury does not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Research from Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, he has played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's larger whole after the 2007-08 season, six of the eight seasons have been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe their improvement in injury statistics from last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you recover from an injury, you can have a prone season when you have to strengthen your body and get competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I'm sure it will happen, and that he will have the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle their squad when Arsenal start their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to maintain balance and give a respite to the players who want it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they generated their own “Invincible” campaign last season.
The stadium was squashed on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It's striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in the fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common among men than in women.
The company's attempt to tackle the problem of the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men's Year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of facing this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2000 secondary school-age pupils who showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person’s chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were “in a healthy mood.”
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved if they had healthy friends.
But in order for a friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style goes beyond the content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of the inner values - the personal growth and friendship of the inner longing - that will have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get greater happiness.
The beauty of the Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
No character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross longing for Rachel - the humor of these came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a volunteer at Samaritans explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have truly understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Often, men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of “getting over” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you see weakness.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term means of survival.
It emphasized the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my impartial, external position on the other end of the phone helps people with moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're taking part in the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the occasion, why don't you take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria finishes and helps PSG slap Malmö on the side
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan are celebrating goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team missed several chances before eventually increasing their lead when Cavan struck the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same Group A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champions, as the game was not only a place in the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-final-leading games in the final three rounds
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost a spot in front of the goal and was later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the stats, and it’s a good start, even if there are things we’ll have to hone in this season,” Blanc said.
This anticipates the good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after three changes in the Paris after a 2-2 draw against Ligue 1 at home against Bordeaux at the weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
As he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named a man who takes PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt's pass was caught behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland into the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It defeated Celtic in the deciding match to reach this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in the deep midfield.
But the team offered little to the offensive side except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which just went past Kevin Trapp's goal post.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to missed passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five attempts in the first half alone and was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from the touch of Ibrahimovic right at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in preliminary work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent a spiral kick, which tilted around Wiland's goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's game thanks to Uruguayan Cavan, who had scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had snubbed Maxwell's cross-pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's excellent save on David Luiz's straight kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was disqualified at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were as high as his team. The Norwegian said, “Our most recent Champions League game was in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'm gonna take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises US$2.5 billion in share sales
The Swiss-based mining giant, Glencore, suffered a price crash in basic commodities, raised US$2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cut plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to repay its debt.
A company that lost 57 percent of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts a strain on demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The new entry raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pemets in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had unveiled a US$2.5 billion stock trade the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its 30-billion-dollar debt burden by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital for 125 pence shares, which meant a 2.4 per cent reduction in Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which were worth a total of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing growth of China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement issued Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
Michelle Obama, the President of the United States and the President's spouse, arrange a dinner for Xi and her husband, Peng Liyuan, after the two-time talks have been held by the leaders.
“Prirentie Xi’s visit will allow us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional, and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively discuss issues of disagreement,” the statement added.
During a visit that was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with a number of U.S. CTOs before continuing to New York City and the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown when they discussed a difference that, according to Damon, is not needed behind the scenes.
In a Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight on HBO, the experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the script selected for the project.
“When we talk about diversity, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not the series,” Damon argued.
The shocked Brown reacted to the injured incredulously, commenting “Oh! Wow. Okay,” while The Martian’s acting comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists.
“I want to urge people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is the whore that his white pimp hits.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied harshly that their directing “could end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger against the film clip, writing: “Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
After its release, the tweet collected more than 5000 retweets and 4000 likes.
Damon's comments hit a time when an accurate racial presentation in the media is in the foreground of social debate.
After a white police officer killed a teenager, Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop practices that discriminate against people in color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when introducing the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
The professional rock climber and tableware collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior race and was rewarded with a million dollar grand prize.
It was the competition program that ended its seventh season and has never had a competitor who would have survived all the sections of the program's obstacle course.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the last task, a rope of about 23 metres was to be climbed in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first ever athlete to clear the exhausting 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock to win the million-dollar grand prize.
“So it’s great to think of this, because I’ve never made or lived on more than 10 000 dollars a year,” Isaac told E! after a big raise.
So suddenly...so I can't even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finals with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten doesn't get more commission money, even though he's the first ever rival to have managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If more than one person passes, the money will be the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling a grudge because of it.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If anyone had to beat me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, with filming to begin in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers snuck past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but is now last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their role as a spoiler on Tuesday when they defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins missed the chance to reach the end of the game halfway from the Houston Astros in a race for another American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return for at least one night to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how you get them,” Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early forward support when Detroit made the run three times in the first two innings, followed once in sixth and once more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) assisted on 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It's hard to pass to a replacement guy in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez scored three times and allowed for two runs, which were his first beaten runs since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since he scored four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He waved the bat well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in the batting practice and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out the left field line twice.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, was knocked out by one nest, and Simon was able to burn down another nest player, Brian Dozier, before Simon was traded to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to take on, the ahead of the novice substitute, Miguel Sano, who pulled the two-nest run to the left of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a tier on the runner's second base, VerHagen got third-placed Trevor Plouffe to beat the goal lead to a double-play goal.
It was a record for the main league: the 27th time this season that Plouffe had a double-play title.
After Detroit's ninth start, Mauer scored two penalties against Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth save.
Detroit initially took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who got off the injured list before the game after being out for more than a month due to inflammation of the lower back.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want to have a start like this,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I felt like I was able to make a few nice passes in the third inning.”
After Hughes caught the starter in the first nest, he allowed the second nest player, Ian Kinsler, to advance one-way.
Right side J.D. Martinez's walk in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to the stroke, who took himself to the first place with a midfield shot and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak with the runners in a good running position.
Third-placed player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was disqualified as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued on the second inning and got one fire, two nests from catcher James McCann and two-fire, one-nests from center Anthony Gose, after which it was 3-0.
“It was an important shot,” Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be on the pass and fed a runless third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was forced to step off due to a shoulder strain on the throwing hand.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder snare, but he was scheduled to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes on the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' stats for the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a real crooked abdominal muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) will take on Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy to the wider world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
“China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency,” he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the leading group on the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency while driving reforms further new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access, a laxisation of border control principles, the call for state-owned enterprises to take up private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list is created to name the sectors and companies that are not allowed to be invested in.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensure a legal business environment and make the market more transparent, the statement said.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private financiers.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residents of foreigners, ‘green cards’, will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, said in a statement released after the meeting.
