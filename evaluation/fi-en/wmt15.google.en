The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio city council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The Juankoski city council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi will continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski joined, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India&#39;s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties, his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May.
Modi&#39;s five-day visit to Japan is aimed at strengthening economic ties with the world&#39;s third-largest economy.
At the forefront of the discussion topics are plans for expanded nuclear power cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defense cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership in Kyiv does not want to carry out an essential political discussion with the eastern part of his country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tassi.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian military forces were firing on civilians.
The objective of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the residents of the area, Putin said.
The event was organized on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was surprising that the crowd came from the very beginning of the evening.
There were as many visitors as expected during the two days, promoter Tom Kangas says.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was organized for the third time.
Next year again.
We intend to continue to be hip-hop festivals, so there will be no pop, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday that limits the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private individuals will have to apply for a permit from the Police Board in order to buy or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is, for example, in cleaning and washing agents, but the concentrations in them usually do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration driving.
Starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the law may, however, be kept and used until March 2, 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of the rapes that happened in two hotels is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of a rape that took place at Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking the woman while she was &quot;in an unconscious state, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself.&quot;
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
According to Judge Lady Rae&#39;s decision, the trial will take place on November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Premier League: Super Raheem shined - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19 years old, Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
There was an electric atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Sunday, when Liverpool, strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario&#39;s debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than in his Manchester City days.
Balotelli was still far from his peak form.
The Italian missed three high-quality goal chances and passed only half of his sixteen passes to his own team.
Pool supporters, who have already made the player their favorite, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers put Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who went to Barcelona, as the team&#39;s second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the star of the team was Raheem Sterling, the top of the midfield diamond, who poked Hugo Lloris past the important opening goal of the 3-0 victory.
Sterling, 19, doesn&#39;t just shine with his powers.
The Englishman, who is 20 centimeters shorter than Balotelli, is between the opponent&#39;s lines like a fish in water.
The feature is not common for a player who runs at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour on grass at his best.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of credit for Sterling&#39;s development.
The Northern Irishman told after the match how Liverpool has systematically developed the northwest Londoner who grew up at the foot of Wembley into a more comprehensive player than just a winger.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - &quot;I am happy and proud&quot;
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers including the Los Angeles Times have asked which orchestra he will take on next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she is happy and proud to start her new position.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in our country&#39;s musical life for over a hundred years, e.g. by premiering a large amount of Sibelius&#39; music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation,&quot; he says.
The administrations of wage earners&#39; organizations meet in the pension negotiation matter - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
New momentum is being sought for the pension negotiations today from the labor market organizations&#39; own meetings.
The administrations of the wage earners&#39; organizations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are supposed to continue.
Labor market organizations have been chafed by, among other things, the dispute about tying the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a career solution by the fall, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created during this week.
Pihtipudas.
The women&#39;s volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, Woman Volley, stumbled against the league riser Vampula&#39;s Urheilijoi in the finals of the Pihtiputaa training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned the game that stretched to five into a 3-2 victory.
WoVo lost the last set 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but Vampula was a little better in the defensive game and the passing game, WoVo&#39;s coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoVo&#39;s six was so crowded that the 190-centimeter American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as center.
Despite her thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and together with Johanna Pekkarinen formed WoVo&#39;s most fiery combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 innings.
The best part of Vampula was the skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo visited as much as possible.
WoVo&#39;s preparation for the league will continue at the turn of next week when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to Rovaniemi for a training camp.
The team will face each other on Saturday at the &quot;shop&quot; at 18:00 in an official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet again at the sports academy.
Lidl is making huge numbers in Finland
The turnover of the company&#39;s stores in Finland increased by almost 25 percent to almost 1.2 billion euros during the financial year that ended at the end of February.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that it paid almost 14 million euros in taxes to Finland for the last fiscal year.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths are more frequent in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women living in urban areas.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the women&#39;s health history over a period of seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, a woman&#39;s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socioeconomic status also affected the chance of survival.
Older women and when the cancer had spread more widely at the time of diagnosis had the lowest probability of survival.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to find out why women living outside the cities have a lower chance of surviving ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
&quot;Gynecologic oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their practices are mostly located in big cities,&quot; says Jordan.
Although remote services are becoming more common and distance is becoming less important, in addition to them, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan&#39;s research, long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are poor regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better care and better cancer prevention programs.
The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old Gold Coast housewife Elisha Neave was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to confirm with the site plan the sled parking operation in Ystävívenenpuisto, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
The City Council decided on Monday that the site plan proposal for Ystävívennpuisto and its surrounding area will be made publicly available at the service point in Osviitta.
Opinions on the plan proposal are requested from the environmental board and the Lapland ely center.
By means of the site plan change, the city wants to enable tourism-related snowmobile activities to continue in the area.
The plan is to create a park area on the site, which includes the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
According to the proposal, between November 15 and April 30, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles can be used permanently.
Refueling points may also be placed in the designated part of the area.
Maintenance traffic will also be allowed into the new park area.
The city of Rovaniemi has leased the area of Ystävívenenpuisto to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is valid until spring 2018.
The sled parking operation and the change in formula have aroused loud opposition.
The residents of the neighboring apartment buildings have been upset about the sound as well as worried about the emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been investigated, and no observations exceeding the guideline values have been revealed in the surveys.
The renewed fleet is also lower in emissions than the old one.
Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, the hotel&#39;s safari customers would have to be transported to the starting points of the safaris by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of Friendship Park and the surrounding area is also large enough for sleds, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the boat pier on the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
Friendship Park is also good for its location, because in the future the activities can expand to, for example, the area of Ounaspaviljongi.
Consolidating parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city&#39;s goal is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by reserving enough high-quality areas in logistically and functionally favorable locations.
Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the partial general plan of the city center, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied housing can be seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the under-35 group, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today&#39;s young consumers reach the &quot;main target group&quot; of garden sales due to their age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in Great Britain.
According to a Financial Times report, renters spend only 55 percent of the amount of money spent by homeowners on gardening.
The research had also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is reduced, as the front yard is paved more and more often as a parking space. These factors also threaten the horticulture industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion a year.
In the greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and there is the lowest amount of money per household spent on garden products in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Horticultural Society (RHS), the increase in house renting or the reduction in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS&#39;s leading garden advisor, says that &quot;for example, plants grown in portable growing containers are particularly popular among apartment renters, because such growing containers can be taken with them when moving.&quot;
According to the HTA&#39;s report, the years 1997-2005 were the heyday of garden resale, as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, after worse weather in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over spying report
Turkey&#39;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the country&#39;s most experienced US diplomat to give an account of a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US embassy&#39;s chargé d&#39;affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former analyst of the US National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main spying target of the US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the significance of the report, saying that all major powers have been spying on each other.
An earlier report about spying on Ankara by Germany&#39;s main intelligence service prompted an angrier reaction from the Turkish government.

Majorca&#39;s Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city council officials at the Majorca Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the holiday island of Majorca, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf area, known for its wet parties.
High Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was placed in pre-trial detention after several shop owners on Punta Ballena street brought corruption charges against him. Most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena street.
According to online daily Mallorca Diario, whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor&#39;s office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spain&#39;s National Guard on corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper published throughout the country, wrote that nightclub owners were angry about the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
&quot;It&#39;s not about money anymore, it&#39;s about survival,&quot; one shop owner told the court.
You are not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines in several countries this summer, when a YouTube video spread online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer engaged in oral sex with 24 men, so-called. during the pub crawl.
Since then, the island&#39;s authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf vacationers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcohol-fueled pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl, Carnage, were jointly ordered to pay 55,000 euros in fines.
Above all, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists has also become popular. the balconing trend that has caused several alcohol-related accidents where people have jumped from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombarded their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but the scars of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashosh Kindergarten, workers removed shrapnel marks from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the kindergarten.
&quot;We&#39;re a little scared but also excited,&quot; says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher in the town&#39;s school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routine.
According to Bart&#39;s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, returning to school after a long time feels &quot;a little strange&quot;.
&quot;We have sometimes had difficult times when we didn&#39;t leave the house anywhere,&quot; he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week&#39;s ceasefire began, thousands of residents of border communities like Saadi had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many of the residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza front, are doubtful about returning after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a good ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that has come under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that &quot;children&#39;s education and safety will be taken care of&quot;.
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate halt to the fighting but did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas&#39;s demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza&#39;s air and sea lanes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 were children.
Israel has disagreed on the death toll. It says at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no hard evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and mortars into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been turned into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, school authorities postponed the start of school the week before.
&quot;I hope that the school will open soon and we can go to school again, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,&quot; said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a shelter in a school in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used measure, house prices have risen the most in seven years during Australia&#39;s winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Price Index, which measures Australian capital home prices, rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
With the increase, the price increase for June, July and August was a total of 4.2 percent, i.e. more than in the same months since 2007.
The year-on-year increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12 months to August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, director of research at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
RP Data&#39;s results show house prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin housing markets are the next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent year-on-year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that has started in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which will be a real test for the housing market.
&quot;Taking into account the increase in the sale of apartments for auction, the generally brisk pace of sales and the continued low level of interest rates, it is likely that the price of apartments will continue to rise over the next three months,&quot; says Lawless.
The new Gösta museum has attracted record audiences to Mäntta
The new museum and Kuvataide have drawn record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
More than 70,000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and it has exhibited, among other things, classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On the other hand, Mänttä Art Weeks said on Monday that it had set a visitor record, when 14,500 interested people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
We are not used to these numbers.
People have been jumping through the doors and windows,&quot; says director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums for the whole year will approach one hundred thousand this year.
In previous years, there have been around 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum director Sivonen reminds that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
&quot;The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,&quot; he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue well beyond the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will open in the art museum.
The police are investigating four thefts committed in the last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property on Pohjolankatu was broken into by breaking a window.
The perpetrator had taken a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from a truck&#39;s tank on Syväojankatu.
On the other hand, a boat with outboard motors had been taken from the Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was a Kalapalta brand, light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the text &quot;OIVA&quot; was written on the beak side.
The police already managed to catch a couple of suspected thieves.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
A police dog tracked him down and a man from Paltamo in his twenties was found hiding under a fir tree in the forest.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
The missing amphetamine led to a murder charge in Kajaani
A man from Kajaani born in 1977 was charged with murder after the disappearance of a batch of less than ten grams of amphetamine.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law partner and another man and shot the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Kajaani, whom he suspected of being a drug dealer.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man who was with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car in which the group was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burned clothes, a sawed-off shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu district court will issue a verdict in the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an August as warm as this happens on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the entire summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter read 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me
Henry was born into an immigrant family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry&#39;s father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19 years old. The relationship between the son and the father was distant.
Henry is currently rehearsing for Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, a comedy show based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father and developed from the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap in an upbeat tempo.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother&#39;s death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
Father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, Stop the fuss.
Leave your sister alone.
Go!
I&#39;m watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, would go to the pub with Dad and discuss things like the shape of a pint or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the unsmiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father&#39;s life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than they were back then.
The smelters are now a little brighter, but in practice they are dark, smoky, labyrinthine depths, where flames, smoke and soot billow, reminiscent of the underworld.
Dad used to take a bath and just lay in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the smelter dirt off himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry&#39;s childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
It wasn&#39;t until my mother started getting sick shortly before she died that we started repeating to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat &quot;I love you&quot; all the time?
Stop the cuddling already!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
With Dawn French.
Why can&#39;t we be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom
Henry is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn&#39;t Dawn and I be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother&#39;s death.
When I started suffering from severe excess weight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a complete turnaround.
After that I started exercising a lot and also had to start a strict diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry&#39;s well-known, short beard perhaps reflects his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics about his role as Othello, he has immersed himself in making theater.
Next in line were Comedy of Errors and August Wilson&#39;s Fences (&quot;Fences&quot;).
Doing theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old as a factory worker.
One of the counters spotted him doing impersonations on stage and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry&#39;s TV career began in the mid-70s. &quot;For quite a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV,&quot; he says.
Henry learned by doing.
I had to grow up in the limelight, I had to learn to produce jokes from the assembly line from 1975 to 1985, while living in stardom and being on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny in the New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry&#39;s manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black make-up, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn&#39;t like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don&#39;t regret it.
Although my position was strange and frowned upon, I got to work at huge events and learned how to handle the public.
Still, &quot;British TV&#39;s award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show&quot; was at the same time &quot;a grotesque parody of black people&quot;.
In the 80s, Henry worked on another comedy series that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s, Henry was known for e.g. for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade doing commercials, documentaries, TV series and feature films, but after his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you&#39;re just pedaling in place or walking on the side tracks&quot;.
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series &quot;What&#39;s So Great About...?&quot;.
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tended to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn&#39;t really taught to us properly in school and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wear tights and have money.
That&#39;s why the subject of Shakespeare instilled fear in me.
Everyone we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don&#39;t dismiss the whole idea until you know what you&#39;re talking about.
Meet the words and you&#39;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 lines of Othello&#39;s last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It was almost as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was being replaced.
“This is what it&#39;s all about, this is important, so take it seriously, Learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was obviously expected to fail, but it didn&#39;t quite happen.
Soon after, Henry played the lead role in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was acting at the British National Theater and I couldn&#39;t believe it.
At one point, the thought occurred to me: &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve changed.&quot;
Once the play had technical problems and Henry clearly felt it was his job to entertain the audience.
&quot;A little voice in my head told me, &#39;You have to be alone for 10 minutes until the computer works again.&#39; &quot;
Instead, the director&#39;s assistant announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem is fixed.
I walked off stage, and a part of me let out a sigh of relief.
It&#39;s not my duty,
I can leave that to others.
&quot;You are part of the play, stay in your role&quot;
Henry in the play &quot;Fences&quot; at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the turns for the play &quot;Fences&quot; was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; &quot;This is what you have to do.&quot;
Of course, Henry says this in an AWFUL voice.
So I decided to stick with this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comedian: little humor kids keep interrupting our conversation as he switches from one impersonation to another.
Refraining from stand-up comedy is a matter of willpower, as receiving immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I occasionally spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but overall it doesn&#39;t excite me the way it used to.
I ask Henry if he plans to go on another stand-up tour.
It&#39;s a real joy for me to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don&#39;t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting -
it&#39;s really fun.
When acting, you are constantly telling a story, and I enjoy that role.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya draws up register of civil servants to weed out &#39;ghost workers&#39;
Kenya has begun compiling a biometric register of civil servants in an effort to remove &quot;ghost workers&quot; from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register in the register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government&#39;s press release announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they leave their civil service positions.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars was spent per month on the salaries of &quot;ghost employees&quot; and other financial abuses.
The government suspects that salaries are paid into the account even after a person has died or left their civil service position, the BBC&#39;s Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants should report themselves to the register over the next few weeks at identification centers to ensure that their information is recorded in the biometric registration format, the government release said.
According to the release, anyone who fails to do this without proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
&quot;With this measure, the public sector is significantly rationalized, because this is how it is determined how many people actually work in their positions. In addition, this is how payrolls at both levels of the government are cleaned. This will solve the problem of &quot;ghost workers&quot;, says Anne Waiguru, an official in the ministry&#39;s cabinet responsible for decentralization and planning.
Seinäjoki&#39;s result for the 2015 financial year may remain in a deficit of EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adapts its operations and spending trends in the tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways to increase efficiency were compromises on the scope and level of services, as well as purchases of services, sales of assets and grants, and increasing tax and payment revenues.
Out of the 10 million euro qualification target for investments, 8.5 million is total.
There is no promise of relief for the municipalities&#39; situation.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a five percent cut in government contributions weaken the outlook even further.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the goal in accordance with the strategy, states the chairman of the city board, Kimmo Heinonen.
The city council returned the submitted proposals to be prepared by the management team.
The city government&#39;s proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the council&#39;s economic seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal will proceed to the city board and the city council through the committee hearing.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of &quot;plotting&quot; against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of &quot;plots against the government&quot;, local media sources say.
Police officials did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officials were among those arrested.
Some of the police were connected to last December&#39;s corruption investigations, the targets of which were government officials, e.g. four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey accused of organizing a large criminal network and monitoring phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said the police actions were part of a planned operation by Islamist leader Fethullah Gulen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
Meanwhile, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
Not every school celebrated the first day of September ceremonies.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the head teacher at the Slaviansk school where Yatsenyuk&#39;s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that the children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
First day of school celebrations traditionally include children&#39;s embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry, Texas, the defamatory tweet was unauthorized
Texas Gov. Rick Perry&#39;s verified Twitter account posted a defamatory photo Sunday night of the Democratic district attorney in the midst of hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another tweet in which Perry swore she had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent without permission from my account.
&quot;I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it,&quot; a later post said.
Perry&#39;s supporters did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry&#39;s verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a defamatory caricature of Travis District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg&#39;s office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet&#39;s caption read: &quot;I don&#39;t always drive drunk, three times the legal limit... But when it happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger.&quot;
I&#39;m the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg&#39;s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the charges, saying the law under which Texas&#39; longest-serving governor is charged is unconstitutionally unclear.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to the state Public Integrity Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector allegations, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry&#39;s decision prompted a left-leaning watchdog group to file an official complaint.
Perry&#39;s verified Twitter account is regularly — and sometimes famously — updated.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to finish in a tie by posting a photo on Twitter of himself jogging on a lake with the caption, &quot;Here we come, South Carolina!&quot; ball.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is &quot;normal&quot; again
One of London&#39;s main property developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has &quot;returned&quot; to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital, London, has been plagued by huge demand and steep price rises amid fears of a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-end developer Berkeley, said on Monday that &quot;since the start of the current financial year, the market and deal volumes have returned to normal after the peak in 2013&quot;, adding that this has enabled a &quot;stable operating environment&quot;.
London&#39;s housing market did well during the recession, with foreign investors flocking to the capital.
According to Land Registry data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 percent in the previous year alone, well above the England and Wales average of 6.7 percent.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student properties in Berkeley rose by around a fifth on the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London real estate a less attractive target in recent months - some interest has also been affected by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible &quot;mansion tax&quot; ahead of May&#39;s general election.
London-based estate agent Foxtons warned last week that April&#39;s mortgage report, which highlighted tighter lending regulations, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, pointing to a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices. According to it, prices will decrease by three percent, because the index that measures the opinion of homeowners about prices has already started to weaken.
The number of deals made in London&#39;s most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter compared to a year ago, real estate agent WA Ellis says.
However, demand for homes in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, which boosted income from property sales to more than £2.2bn.
Pidgley added that &quot;demand for a well-designed, right-of-use product in the best locations has remained steady, and consequently sales have remained strong.&quot;
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April. This is almost a third more than the peak before the financial crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% compared to a year ago to £380 million and turnover increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company&#39;s annual meeting that Berkeley&#39;s earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that full-year pre-tax profit will be £450m.
Berkeley shares traded flat at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
A hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have the photos of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
The Hunger Games star&#39;s representative confirmed that the photos are genuine and condemned the hacker for &quot;brazen invasion of privacy&quot;.
The authorities have been contacted and anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will face charges.
The images, which were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple&#39;s iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars to be hacked allegedly includes dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It&#39;s not known how many of the photos are genuine, but Scott Pilgrim vs. The World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
&quot;To those looking at photos of me and my husband taken in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you&#39;re in good spirits,&quot; Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon&#39;s &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; series denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that &quot;these so-called nude pictures of me are FAKE, don&#39;t you understand&quot;.
Let me end this right from the start.
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that a representative for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the photos of the star.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson&#39;s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter j
They dissolved, that was the best description of what happened, gradually they separated from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from her that she was too serious, laborious, intense, detached, and maybe also a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the prickly pear.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his barbs had been a relationship in its early stages, which had been promising nonetheless; it had seemed like this relationship might have eased his lonely boredom, and perhaps even brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyful heart, from a northern village even more rugged and remote from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern assumed was his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house that was located in a humid but paradise-like valley, and the name of the valley was aptly Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, snails had left their marks on the windows claiming the whole place for themselves, the garden was growing weeds that resembled giant heads of cabbage.
The cottage was like a children&#39;s fairy tale, threatening and magical at the same time, the garden full of secrets.
Narrated by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot;J&quot; is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had been sitting hand-in-hand with Ailinn on a broken patio chair in the middle of the long grass, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both absent-mindedly listening to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when Ailinn&#39;s crossed, sun-tanned legs reminded Kevern of a song he had been singing a long-forgotten black performer who his father had often listened to with the shutters down in the cabin.
Your foot is too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive, and they were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren&#39;t banned - nothing really was banned - they just weren&#39;t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word itself.
Public opinion achieved what laws and proclamations had not achieved: just as in the field of literature people chose to read memoirs of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
Driven wild by the day, Kevern started playing the imaginary piano and singing a serenade to Ailinn&#39;s big feet in a brazenly comical voice.
Ailinn didn&#39;t understand.
&quot;It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,&quot; Kevern told him, instinctively raising two fingers to his mouth.
That&#39;s what his father had always done before the letter &quot;j&quot; could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word starting with j and didn&#39;t remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn&#39;t a very funny game then, and it isn&#39;t now.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn&#39;t really banned either, it just wasn&#39;t played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one if word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was wit presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by age 10, he had been introduced to jazz music through his father&#39;s semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn&#39;t have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn&#39;s age, it was likely that she couldn&#39;t remember a time when popular singers weren&#39;t black.
There was no need for laws or coercion here either.
An obedient society meant that each of its parts gratefully accepted—grateful, that they were spared as it were by fortune—the principle that each group did what was natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of Afro-Caribbean ancestry were best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they were like naturally gifted with electrical devices, so it was their job to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to get things done.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not slyly fled for fear of being accused of fanning the flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants that served labneh -yoghurt and smoked a hookah, and went on with their lives with their eyes on the ground and depressed into boredom.
Let each act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for her to understand how the hurtful words Kevern had just sung could ever be put to music.
Love was expressed through music.
&quot;They&#39;re not really offensive,&quot; Kevern said.
Except maybe in the opinion of bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
Not a single word would get through the soundproofing of the leaves of the giant cabbage plants.
Ailinn still didn&#39;t understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but didn&#39;t want to raise two fingers to his lips in Ailinn&#39;s company.
Ailinn found him strange already.
&quot;Dad thought it was funny,&quot; she said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, her hair obscuring Kevern&#39;s field of vision.
There is nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailinn&#39;s huge, raven-black head of hair.
He didn&#39;t want to see anything else.
&quot;If you say so,&quot; he said, but he didn&#39;t sound convinced.
That doesn&#39;t explain why you&#39;re singing it to me though.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren&#39;t really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don&#39;t hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said “I love you” but it was still too early for that.
&quot;I find you attractive because of your thick ankles,&quot; he tried to correct the situation.
I&#39;m twisted in that sense.
This was no help.
He had wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her patio chair, knocking over the receiver in the process and spilling the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine was only made from elderflowers, so he couldn&#39;t use that as the reason for the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
&quot;And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you,&quot; he said...
Except I don&#39;t feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, needlessly cruel words and the fear that showed in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he would hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the frozen northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that in essence it had been the same as life here.
The same vast, icy sea that surged against them.
The same deranged men, though even paler and more devilish after WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker grandfathers, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat up any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Butt?
He would still see a thick fist if he wasn&#39;t careful!
Suck first - kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – absorb first, then attack.
In Kevern&#39;s opinion, even that was too much, because sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons body language told her to leave.
He pulled himself up from the patio chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern&#39;s grief surprised her.
This wasn&#39;t the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go - just as her traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window - the man who was the cause of his difficult life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man with his back turned, bowed, ashamed, beaten, with no will to fight—why did he feel that the sight was so familiar to him, even though he couldn&#39;t remember ever seeing anything like it before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked down at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked for the private Public Opinion polling agency Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the persistence of low- and moderate-intensity violence in those areas of the country where it was most likely to decrease, or even cease, given its money and energy spent on weeding.
&quot;Much has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to level the natural aggressiveness of a people who have fought for thousands of years and mostly won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers reaching over the hedges, human gentleness has rarely been known throughout the ages .
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The nation weeps with sentimental ballads, devours stories of overcoming adversity and swears by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty has an unrelenting grip on both rural communities and urban communal areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more vicious will to quarrel in homes, workplaces, our streets and even in playgrounds.
“You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize,” his supervisor commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down at the ground.
Also, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have to answer that,&quot; Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme still invoked her right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I&#39;m not asking,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I&#39;m against atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
No prejudices are maintained in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain level of hypersensitivity in and of itself is perfectly acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to skewed results like the ones you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the Church - and what you call cruelty or meanness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Whining about WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz&#39;s head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed the instruction that Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the previous quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than the written, but nothing beats love.
“I understand very well what you mean,” Esme Nussbaum replied in a low voice when she was sure her guide had finished, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I worry that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED in the first place.
This time, though, we won&#39;t pour out our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You&#39;re going too far,” he said, “to describe as &#39;mistakes&#39; the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say they vented their &#39;anger and distrust on others&#39;”.
Someone in your position should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about &#39;us&#39; or &#39;them&#39;.
There was no &#39;us&#39; and no &#39;others&#39;.
It was a time of chaos, that&#39;s all we know about it.
&quot;If we&#39;re being completely honest, in that chaos,&quot; Esme dared to continue, &quot;no group in society can say they behaved well.
I don&#39;t blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
Then was then.
There&#39;s no need to talk more about it - we agree on this.
And just as there is no need to dish out blame, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are warranted or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what is the past for, if you don&#39;t learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I&#39;ll go over your report,” he said, signaling that it was time for Esme to go.
The next day, when he was going to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as &quot;bad-tempered and furious&quot;.
Accidents happen.
Lesotho&#39;s military denies planning attack; the prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho&#39;s military officials have denied staging an attack to topple the government and said they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to the neighboring country of South Africa after saying that he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack, saying the army was responding to a threat from &quot;political fanatics&quot;. The police are said to have tried to arm the fanatics.
&quot;The Lesotho Defense Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements of the police force are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause trouble,&quot; he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela, the army&#39;s actions looked like an attempted revolution.
&quot;Although no entity has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defense Forces show in every way the hallmarks of a corresponding revolutionary attempt,&quot; he says.
Lesotho army officials said soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane&#39;s absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has been experiencing tensions since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to differences in the grand coalition government.
He denies that he thus belittled the power of the government, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft is establishing a data center in Uusimaa
The information technology company Microsoft has established a large data center in Uusimaa, the location of which the company refuses to specify.
In the press release sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been guessed as the center&#39;s location.
Microsoft will completely close its Oulu office, which will take away the jobs of around 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft&#39;s communications director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company will not comment on how many personnel the new data center will employ.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data center in Uudellemaa.
A man is accused of running over a girl at a traffic light intersection

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different equipment options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I personally took these photos at a family gathering using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules you should follow.
Always double check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure the camera battery and other parts are sealed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera&#39;s shooting settings to match the photos or video to be taken.
Some cameras or camera/camcorder combinations have a setting that optimizes shooting conditions underwater.
Also - before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can go.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others up to a depth of 50-60 feet.
Check out both regular and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos – many of them will fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to compose the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it&#39;s hard to see underwater, and framing your shot can be hit or miss.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows bracketing, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This way you can also get more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the subject to be photographed.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning the photographer must be close to the subject so that the subject fills the entire frame of the image.
China won&#39;t let Hong Kong choose its leaders - protesters vow revenge
China&#39;s parliament ruled on Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing unrest calling for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district after activists began planning and executing demonstrations just hours after the decision was announced.
The ruling by the Chinese National People&#39;s Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to root out any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
&quot;This was expected, but it&#39;s still infuriating,&quot; says Democratic Party Chairwoman Legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the People&#39;s Congress Committee of the People&#39;s Republic of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that public nominations to elect Hong Kong&#39;s leader would be too &quot;chaotic&quot;.
Since 1997, when Great Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday&#39;s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes clear that China wants to tightly control the election process through a nominating committee administered from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who &quot;love the country and love Hong Kong&quot; will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong saw some of the region&#39;s largest and most high-profile protests in years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was announced, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong&#39;s main government buildings.
At the rally, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and that they would create waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not share the details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement posted online, the organizers said the movement &quot;considers the Occupy Central seizure as a last resort, to be used only when there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way.&quot;
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has failed and the takeover of the city center will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for days, and security was tight near the main government buildings on Sunday. There were e.g. police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the unrest is fueled by the feeling of many that the residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong&#39;s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten the lifeblood of Hong Kong - the business world.
&quot;The protest they&#39;re talking about could lead to big financial losses, depending on how many people participate and how long it lasts,&quot; says lawmaker Regina Ip, a long-time critic of the movement.
We don&#39;t want any concern to spread that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grasp.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media have also presented stories according to which Hong Kong&#39;s democracy activists are minions of the Western powers fomenting the revolution&quot;.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong&#39;s electorate.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
American prom tradition hits British universities: private jets for new students
We&#39;re excited to meet the demand by launching Britain&#39;s first luxury form of travel for today&#39;s students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other vehicles, such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their belongings across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF (VIP Friends) features, we are ready to provide today&#39;s students with the easiest and highest quality transportation to university.
According to the company representative, no reservations have been received yet, as the service has just been established, but added that &quot;students will start placing orders in the next few weeks&quot;.
The company believes there is demand for the service, despite most students paying annual fees of £9,000.
In terms of their expectations and wishes, today&#39;s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now more than ever, it&#39;s more important to make a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticized the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, the vice president of the higher education section of the organization, &quot;this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the majority of students&quot;.
Many who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, as the available financial supports in the form of loans and grants have lagged behind the staggering increase in basic living costs. Only next can we start thinking about where to find thousands to spend on something as simple as getting to campus.
Ipswich&#39;s &quot;pig house&quot; for sale
Real estate agents have removed a sales photo of a house for sale in Suffolk after they noticed a large pig lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room, where the pig rested its head on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner&#39;s pet.
&quot;However, the picture ended up in the notification by accident, and it has since been removed,&quot; says the company&#39;s representative.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as a &quot;unique one bedroom house&quot;.
Although Kiinteistönvälytys has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where people have asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres&#39; departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
The departure of Spanish striker Fernando Torres from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same opening of the door.
Chelsea announced that they have signed French forward Loic Remy from neighboring club QPR on a four-year contract.
According to newspaper reports, the purchase price is 13 million euros.
Torres, 30, will join AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He joined Chelsea from Liverpool for a world record fee of £50m four years ago but never lived up to expectations.
Japanese player Shinji Kagawa&#39;s unsuccessful trip to Manchester United also came to a decision.
As expected, Kagawa returns to Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his move to ManU.
According to press reports, the purchase price is around 8 million euros.
Kagawa&#39;s new contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I&#39;m happy to be a Dortmund man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment, Kagawa said.
Another Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin is getting stronger with Salomon Kalou.
The Ivorian national team striker will move to Hertha from the French side Lille, and the transfer fee is estimated to be around 3 million euros.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played 2006-12 at Chelsea.
Eight people have already died in the Paris apartment building explosion
The death toll rose to eight on Monday after an apartment building explosion in a suburb of Paris.
Eleven people were injured, four of them seriously, in the accident that took place in the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday.
Rescue workers were still looking for survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but the hope of finding survivors faded.
A gas leak has been suspected as the preliminary cause of the explosion.
The explosion happened early on Sunday and was so powerful that it shook buildings more than a hundred meters away.
Our whole house was moving: we were shaking with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing&quot;, described Maryline Yyvon, who lives next to the crash site.
Emergency accommodation for the residents of the house was already set up at a nearby school on Sunday.

Bulgarian prison staff hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
Salary increases are also scheduled to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have symbolically protested against the new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting between representatives of the prison workers&#39; organization and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are currently underway, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate General for the Execution of Sentences, told BNR.
Members of the Trade Union of the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protest of the prison workers&#39; organization.
Basketball: The fans&#39; encouragement was almost too much: Sasu Salin had to pass out on the court
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland&#39;s victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch-black USA match and made Ukraine&#39;s second half bloody with his stopping decisions.
But Salin passed all the credit to the wolf fans - and did it in style:
I wanted to pass out on the field at the end, the encouragement was so great.
My eyes just got blurry, I couldn&#39;t do anything.
The noise and the white sea of people was almost too much for me.
Salini&#39;s moments of power included nine surfaces at a fast pace, possession of the ball, holes in the boards and smacking in every place where it happened.
I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I got into such a state of flow that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu beamed.
That&#39;s my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others also caught on to the plot.
It caught the whole gang.
Salin is the cheerleader and spirit creator of the team, so it&#39;s no wonder that his example lifted the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year break: I remembered the outrageous referee game from the previous ones
Heikki Montonen (right) carrying the bag was Finland&#39;s head coach at the World Cup tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men&#39;s national volleyball team last played in the final tournament of the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish cameraman at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland&#39;s second coach and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first group.
&quot;The referee&#39;s play in the deciding balls of that match was blatant,&quot; recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled into the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that things got even more messy,&quot; said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finally finished 17th.
Now Finland is among the world&#39;s champions again, when the World Cup tournament in Poland gets underway today, Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball in 32 years.
The power values of the players are roughly the same as before, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average height of the players has also increased.
The game is even faster,&quot; thought Parkkali.
But how is it going in Poland?
Finland&#39;s player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to advance from the first group.
Then it can get tough,&quot; says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on the attack in the victorious match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let&#39;s hope that the 17th place is broken now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go upside down,&quot; said Parkkali.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the national team&#39;s second coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö fanned out in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening worship at the sailors&#39; church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team&#39;s program at the World Cup tournament in 1982.

The finals of the Young Star singing competition have been contested - no victory for South Karelia
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen, who reached the finals of the Nuori Tähti singing competition, did not advance to win the competition.
No other rankings were published in the competition.
According to singing teacher Teija Immonen, the competition has been popular.
It gives you good experience.
The finalists will still record the songs of the competition.
Competition moments always leave great memories, says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescued Cita the dog from a mountain in Norway: &quot;These men deserve all the thanks&quot;
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
At the weekend, Mikkelsen looked for &quot;international heroes&quot; on Facebook so he could thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the dog Cita, who was with him in the mountains on Thursday, hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on the steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself but couldn&#39;t so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to entice and pull it forward a little, but its legs just couldn&#39;t carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help came from the police, a nearby hotel, or passers-by.
As the evening darkened, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there happened to be two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway&#39;s highest mountain, Galdhøpiggen, and were heading to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm considering the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanom in his message.
Soon, a German man also happened to come with a camping mattress.
From the mattress, Cita was given a stretcher-like structure to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came to the scene a little while after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in our arms down the slope for a while, Soini says.
PHOTO: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a travel mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically demanding, but the carrying was slow in the difficult terrain.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen still searched for &quot;international heroes&quot; on Facebook so that he could thank them once more.
Soinit answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don&#39;t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn&#39;t helped me, we probably wouldn&#39;t have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn&#39;t thank them enough.
I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, Soini were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - They say Cita is already doing better!

A genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a wrong diagnosis.
For most of her youth, Karin Rodgers thought she only had a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
Actually, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It refers to a group of inherited diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem with CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and tingling in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich&#39;s ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be confined to a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two says that &quot;as a child, I knew I couldn&#39;t do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than others in everything.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13, he underwent multiple Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgeries, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers, where it was said that he was suffering from FA disease.
&quot;I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association,&quot; he says.
When I got the information from them, I was shocked and in a panic-like state.
I thought I&#39;d be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 and dead before I turned 25, and in between I&#39;d slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he realized that his walking hadn&#39;t deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said: &quot;baby girl, I don&#39;t think you have this disease, because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair&quot;.
I think you are suffering from some much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
&quot;When it was explained to me what CMT is, I thought I had been put off,&quot; he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes CMT Month to raise awareness of the disease.
One hundred migrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country&#39;s interior ministry said on Monday.
The lightning drivers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn&#39;t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,&quot; said Ivo Koteski, spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid around 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros more to get to Serbia.
A large number of illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, which has a couple of million inhabitants, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled Syria&#39;s bloody civil war.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian magazine, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on September 18.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scots.
In the past, the actor Sean Connery, among others, has given his support for independence.
Instead, for example, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scots to remain a part of Britain.
In the polls, supporters of independence have been defeated.
The difficulties of department stores continued in midsummer - Kotimaa uutiset - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline in general store sales continued in July as well, says Päivittäistavarakauppa ry.
According to it, the turnover of department store and hypermarket chains in July was 3.2 percent lower than a year ago.
Sales of home and leisure products have suffered the worst, with sales falling by more than seven percent from a year ago.
Clothing products also sold clearly weaker than the previous summer.
The value of retail sales of daily goods, on the other hand, increased by almost three percent in July from a year ago.
Sales grew the most in small stores and large supermarkets.
During the entire beginning of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has shrunk by more than two percent.
Sales of daily goods, on the other hand, have increased by almost one percent.
Joan Rivers&#39; family &#39;hopes for the best&#39;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was brought to a central New York hospital, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
&quot;Thank you for your continued love and support,&quot; Melissa Rivers wrote today.

His mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday in cardiac arrest. According to sources, the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on the Upper East Side at the time reported the emergency to the hospital.
Doctors are deliberately keeping him sedated with medication and monitoring his condition closely until his currently serious condition is stable again.
The incident has caused widespread public reaction, with the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa offering support online.
Areva-Siemens: The Olkiluoto triple reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered the updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima TVO.
According to Areva&#39;s press release, the project&#39;s recent delays are mainly due to the fact that approval has been applied for the reactor&#39;s automation systems.
The project is already years behind schedule.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the completion time of the triple reactor.
Nastola donated a 1.4 hectare beach plot to Bottas - value around 60,000 euros
Nastola&#39;s municipal government donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot on the shore of Kärkjärvi in Villähte to formula driver Valtteri Bottaks.
The municipal government showed fair sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no sounds of gravel at the meeting when the plot was decided, says municipal director Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas&#39; gift plot has farm buildings - seven in total.
Except for one, the municipality will dismantle them this year.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the plot within two years.
We are pleased that he has enjoyed his birth and wants to be here in the future as well.
Valtteri has visited elementary schools every year to talk about his sports career and life.
And hopefully it will continue to happen, the mayor says.
The municipal manager estimates the monetary value of the beach plot to be 40,000-60,000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
Over the decades, with varying degrees of success, Nastola has kept those who are successful in sports in the municipality with the help of gift plots.
Javelin world champion Aki Parviainen and aerobics world champion Tuuli Matinsalo received detached plots from the municipality and built luxurious detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved elsewhere when their life situation changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syyrakki insists and believes that Bottas will stay in his hometown.
Hull offloaded striker Hernandez for a club record fee
Premier League club Hull invested a club record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay international Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez switches to Hull from the Italian club Palermo for 9.5 million pounds, or about 12 million euros.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B and were promoted to the Italian top flight.
In the national team of Uruguay, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
In last summer&#39;s World Cup final tournament, Hernandez came on the field as a substitute in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic signing and shows how far we have come in a short time, said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull announced that they had also signed Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russian space experiment failed - geckos sent on a sex trip died
The five little geckos sent by Russia to reproduce in space have died, says the Russian space agency Roscosmos in its press release.
The geckos traveled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to earth on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and behavior of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
Through the effects on geckos, it is possible to try to anticipate what kind of effects weightlessness would have on humans when they stay in a similar state for longer periods of time, the New Statesman illustrated in July.
According to Roscosmos, the geckos&#39; time of death and the cause or causes of death are being investigated.
According to the Interfax news agency, the passengers, dubbed &quot;sex geckos&quot;, froze.
The fact that the fruit flies that traveled aboard the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without difficulty, and also had offspring, also speaks to the surprise.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities announced the matter on Sunday.
The authorities tracked down the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl with money to go to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline didn&#39;t believe the girl&#39;s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother, who lives in Istanbul, and alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl&#39;s father, who was completely unaware of the daughter&#39;s intentions and told the authorities that the family has no relatives in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he currently lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man&#39;s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been worried that radicalized young people attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French citizens or those registered in France have traveled to Syria, returned from there or are currently planning to go to Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team&#39;s hopes for a further place are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary victories for the next place.
Ukraine is a good team, but I think we have a good chance to win, Petteri Koponen predicts.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the Games on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player for Ukraine is the playmaker Eugene &quot;Pooh&quot; Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100m world champion three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but yes, we have played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than in yesterday&#39;s loss to the United States.
We have to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that you will see a normal wolf pack on the field, Möttölä said.
Alleged sex photos of Hollywood stars are spreading on the Internet - some of them have been confirmed as genuine
A number of nude photos are circulating on the Internet, which are allegedly depicting well-known public figures.
Among other things, the actress Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of the &quot;sleeping picture campaign&quot;.
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence&#39;s representatives that appears to confirm the authenticity of the photos.
This is a blatant invasion of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos circulating about her are genuine.
She had taken the pictures in question years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the gruesome effort that went into this.
I sympathize with everyone who fell victim to the hack, he writes, according to the site.
On the other hand, actress Victoria Justice says that the pictures with her own name are fake.
There are also real or fake nude photos of at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: &quot;They don&#39;t work hard enough to get out of here&quot;
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala&#39;s comments after Sunday&#39;s VPS match well describe the club&#39;s confused current situation.
I haven&#39;t had a goalkeeper coach for four months.
But you have to adapt to everything,&quot; Viitala said after the struggle ended in a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not happy about the poor defensive play.
Player traffic has been brisk in Honga this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
Thanks to player roulette, many young players have also received opportunities that they might not even deserve.
&quot;Some don&#39;t work hard enough to get out of here one day,&quot; Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga&#39;s head coach Shefki Kuqi somewhat agreed with Viitala.
&quot;I told certain players after the game that if you come to practices and games to have fun and think you&#39;re a punt league player and don&#39;t have to work, then you&#39;re probably on the wrong team,&quot; Kuqi said.
I have given many young people playing time.
If they don&#39;t want to take that spot and take advantage of the opportunity, it&#39;s not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that you can&#39;t expect immediate success from the players when the players are constantly changing.
This season, there has not been the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive end, the team has changed.
That&#39;s the main reason we&#39;re in this position,&quot; Kuqi stated.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a series jumbo, tied with the second-to-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoos still have time to avoid relegation to Ikkö.
I&#39;ve never dropped a team, and I&#39;m not going to drop it now either.
We&#39;re definitely not going to drop out of this series,&quot; goalkeeper Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, who worked as a film producer in Trier, told about the series project on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to the release of the production company Zentropa, filming of the series should begin in 2016.
It is said that Trier will devote himself to the script work of the series from this fall.
The series is in English.
Trier&#39;s long-term partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his tough sales pitches, also tells about the mysterious project in the press release.
According to him, a similar series &quot;has never been seen and will never be seen&quot;.
&quot;Hold your breath,&quot; says Aalbæk Jensen in the announcement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his sensational media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Valtakunta series for television.
01.09.2014 15:20 Kauppaketju Lidl seems to have won the Finns over, at least if the results are to be believed.
Retail group The turnover of the Lidl Suomi Kommandiittiytiö group, which runs Lidl&#39;s operations in Finland, continued to grow in the financial period that ended at the end of February.
The company also increased its profit.
The result before taxes reached 79.6 million euros, compared to 56.4 million euros a year earlier.
Turnover increased from 960 million euros to 1.2 billion euros.
The increase was 25 percent.
The company, which increased its market shares, also improved its operating profit from 61 million euros to 84 million euros.
The operating profit percentage was 7.1.
The accounting period of German-owned Lidl lasts from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company says it paid 13.7 million euros in tax to Finland for the fiscal year that ended in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its chain of stores, has said that it will invest 100 million euros in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
A participant in the Ice Bucket challenge was jaw-dropping
Britain&#39;s Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the bones in her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken to hospital after she roared so hard during the Ice Bucket challenge that her jaw dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice cold water was poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
&quot;The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared I felt my jaw start to stiffen,&quot; he tells The Mirror magazine.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth but I couldn&#39;t, my jaw was locked and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old Briton, who participated in the super popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to the hospital, where his jaw was put back in place.
The clip has become an internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
A perspective on howling wolves (too): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France in the Maroussi ball sports hall in Athens.
Pehkonen did not exaggerate.
I remember the game when was there.
So were the hundred or so Finns who shouted uproar into the otherwise empty hall, which attracted 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine match at the World Cup?
There are eighty times the number of Finnish fans in Bilbao.
The European Championship 1995 was a time of search for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, in the qualifying match against Russia in the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möttölä on the final tournament team with chalk lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wiser, even if everything didn&#39;t go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team took a deep dive.
At the Athens Games, there were reportedly a little over a hundred Finns in total.
That group included journalists, players&#39; relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao too, but there are also fans there.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can probably say the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever the number is in between, it&#39;s an unfathomable amount.
Here&#39;s some explaining to sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are succeeding in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, professor of exercise sociology.
There are certainly Finns who are looking for an experience in both Spain and the volleyball World Cup in Poland.
Shared experience.
That still doesn&#39;t explain everything.
The sport itself must also have attraction.
Itkonen makes sports a part of popular culture.
It&#39;s a lower threshold to go to a sports competition than to go to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses still cannot be mobilized.
Let&#39;s go back to 1995.
That&#39;s when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and national team activities were put on a pedestal.
The volleyball team did the same move a little earlier.
Now both are enjoying the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have succeeded in productizing their top sports, where the holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalistic support is, Itkonen reminds.
Will the ball sports be able to transfer this massive interest to domestic leagues as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played for an average of hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen considers the question a good one, and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good things for the sports.
Another school of thought believes that interest will shift.
The other is the one who doesn&#39;t want a full stomach of sweets.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic leagues are not of dual interest.
There is a challenge for social people in the midst of drugs.
Confirmation for the Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the shore of the lake
Nastola rewards formula driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach house plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the handover of the 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
A leisure apartment will be built on the plot in the future.
Bottas&#39; success has been followed in Nastola since his karting days.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
Lahjatontti is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of Nastola municipality as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in the area that are in a state of demolition, of which the municipality will demolish six by the end of this year at its own expense.
Bottas achieved his fourth podium finish this year in the Belgian race of Formula 1.
He is fifth in the World Championship points.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and spent his childhood in Villähti.
He currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever he is free from formulas.
Bottas has visited middle schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently introducing and testing them at the ongoing US Open tennis tournament in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren&#39;s smart shirts are the ball people on the court, but also amateur Marcus Giron, who is one of the top college players, likes one.
According to him, the shirt helps him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into the nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the button in the shirt and from there to a smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The hood, which acts as a central unit, is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told the exact time when the sale of the shirt will start, nor has it even hinted at its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothes.
Athos from California has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars a piece and the thumb-sized CPU they require costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about techno clothes.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who will soon start his second year of study, came up with a clever way to save on costs.
He developed a system where students in later years borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling the books on right away.
“My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to use it for the whole semester and I ate a sandwich,&quot; says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says her books last semester would have normally cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university&#39;s board of trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce those costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder&#39;s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, which allows them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which runs more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
The industry statistics reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online shops
In online stores, you can get a new book for only a third of the price it would cost in the campus bookstore.
The Ninth Edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler&#39;s &quot;Calculus&quot; book has a suggested retail price of almost $290, but you can get the book for $239.99 from the online specialty book store Chegg.com.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not bothered by other people&#39;s notes and worn appearance.
For example, you can get the &quot;Calculus&quot; book used from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University senior Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book &quot;Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business&quot; used on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
A new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst&#39;s College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the changes in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, you can find an old edition for a fraction of the price you would have to pay for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc&#39;s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Lease
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you take good care of them, remember to return them and don&#39;t need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 percent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a &quot;Calculus&quot; book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of a highlighter, and wear and tear to subsequent payments.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Acquiring e-books instead of regular paper ones can also come into question.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the right to use the e-book is paid to its owner, for example Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes &amp; Noble Inc bookstores.
You can get the &quot;Calculus&quot; book as an e-book from the Chegg store for about $61 for six months.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, no matter which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start law school at Pepperdine, recommends using a book&#39;s ISBN number to determine the price because it helps you make sure you&#39;re looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, says Gault.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he finally had to buy the book at full price from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theater turns 20 years old
Founded in 1994, the theater opposes unemployment, marginalization and passivity.
Everyone who wants to make performing art is welcome to the activity.
Organizes hobby activities focused on expression for the long-term unemployed aged 17-35.
The shows often take a stand on society.
In recent years, e.g. depressive Depression Moderata, My Self! - humorous stories about narcissism and classic adaptations.
Believes that every person can change their own life.
Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Almost twice as many people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the central organization of the Finnish rescue industry (Spek), so far 55 people have died in fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years old.
According to the organization&#39;s fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spec reminds you to review your home&#39;s fire safety.
According to Spek, at least the functionality of all fire alarms in the home should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all areas of the home.
Children should also be told which electrical devices they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in Newport city center for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called to the anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had come from as far away as Belgium.
The young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were rescued after being stranded overnight in the Blue Mountains in Australia&#39;s New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after midday on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were worried about the young people who had not returned home, and called the police at 8pm.
A search party made up of local police and helpers was dispatched to look for the youths, and the duo was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Officers spent the night with the pair and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have fiercely clashed with Russian tanks in the field.
According to a representative of the army, the cannon fire from the opposing side has been so accurate that the shooters are probably Russian professional soldiers.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
The Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery hits in the Sea of Azov off southeast Ukraine yesterday sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard was not sure where the vessel was fired from.
The separatists already said yesterday on social media that they had fired at the vessel.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the foreign minister, an immediate cease-fire without conditions should be achieved in the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our companies.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains lashed southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed up traffic and buried cars.
Officials estimated on Sunday that it might take some time to calm the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was given about the rains in advance.
Ari Mustala, meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rain front that plagued the area was very localized.
The rain zone appears narrow and stationary.
No wonder if it has been difficult to predict.
French socialists should &quot;shut up and help France&quot;, says Francois Hollande&#39;s main supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to &quot;show their feelings&quot; towards the embattled Socialist president, whose new government failed to win the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone&#39;s respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
&quot;Our task is to stay by his side,&quot; Valls said and earned applause.
In a placating gesture, the prime minister called on the government to leave France&#39;s controversial 35-hour work week alone, despite new economy minister Emmanuel Macron&#39;s controversial suggestion earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work with a coalition government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused a rift by appearing at a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing &quot;France to give up hope for the future&quot;.
The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, mocked the socialists&#39; constant mutual discord and said that she does not think Valls&#39; new government will last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war calling, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty it was to form a new government after the previous one didn&#39;t last even through the summer.
&quot;And the new government will not last until autumn or winter,&quot; Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party&#39;s proposal to dissolve the parliament and was sure of his party&#39;s electoral victory in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France&#39;s ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right held the top spot in the May EU elections.
According to a poll in Sunday&#39;s Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party may split into several rival factions before Hollande&#39;s term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
&quot;There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to quickly notice that change is happening,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Huomenta Suomen&#39;s presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Poudan Pokka badly betrayed them in the recorded part of the program.
The Huomenta Suomi program published a funny video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Huomenta Suomen&#39;s commercial puff from the next day&#39;s broadcast, but the recording doesn&#39;t quite go through.
Alm-Siira messes up his words when he tries to pronounce the word budget riih, and his messing up also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their minds again and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live even tomorrow, Huomenta Suomen&#39;s Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at Lehkuva&#39;s photo agency, placed third in the series of portraits in 1972.
The picture shows Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In May 1971, a meeting of the Socialist International was organized in the building of Rakennusmestarien on Helsinki&#39;s Fredrikinkatu.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given a good five minutes for filming.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were just right.
I immediately understood that this time I succeeded.
You can see from Meiri&#39;s expression that leaders in the Middle East have had it difficult before.
Back then, you did well in the competition with photos taken of famous people or events.
It&#39;s great that nowadays you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I&#39;ve taken.
The best is Lasse Virén&#39;s fall picture from the Munich Olympics.
I didn&#39;t send it to the competition.
Claim: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the activities of the drug unit of the Helsinki police has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 man-years of work.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his information technology dissertation for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the information technology systems of investigation and court proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple uses of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system where the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence material that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The thesis will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The concept of vegetarian food from 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: &quot;Vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken dishes&quot;
A photo of a special announcement on the wall of the Naistenmatka school in Pirkkala caused an uproar on social media, reports Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the menu, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old bulletin that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The picture that spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Food and cleanliness service manager Arja Vaarma tells Yle that the note left on the wall is incorrect and should have been removed some time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has been such an idea, which has been discussed with health care.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, he tells Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala&#39;s schools are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a doctor&#39;s or nurse&#39;s certificate of a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle by saying that young people&#39;s experiments with vegetarian food may leave their nutrition lacking, and the absence of meat or chicken may arouse surprise from the students&#39; parents.
Norwegian Cruise Close to $3 Billion Prestige Cruise Deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world&#39;s third-largest cruise company, is in talks to buy rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The information comes from people closely involved with the matter.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruise, which has a market capitalization of $6.8 billion, would gain access to Prestige Cruises&#39; luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) - against companies.
According to the sources, the information about the possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
Prestige Cruises&#39; owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names made public because the negotiations are not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, and Apollo&#39;s representative declined to comment.
Operating from Miami, the Norwegian Cruise company has 13 cruise ships whose route map covers North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it reached $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also operating out of Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and a route map covering Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was 1.2 billion dollars, which is six percent more than the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of middle classes in developing economies such as China and India.
Companies are competing to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company&#39;s shares since the 2007 deal, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current configuration in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in the Norwegian Cruise company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting&#39;s share of the company was 28 percent, Apollo&#39;s 20 percent, and private equity investment company TPG Capital LP&#39;s share was 8 percent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies in the North American cruise capacity is 82 percent, according to the registration document published by the Prestige Cruise company in connection with the IPO.
The Tampere city government will discuss the issue today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will provide solid support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, executive director of Animalia, who is preparing her PhD for the University of Tampere, the era of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world needs to end quickly.
In recent years, there has fortunately been a widespread view around the world that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is not sustainable in terms of animal protection and ethics.
I would hope that this vision is also carried over to Tampere.
Abolishing the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere&#39;s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens demands for the shutdown of dolphinarium operations.
Näs&#39;s death is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It&#39;s time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and begin to find out how Tampere&#39;s dolphins could be moved to a demarcated sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi didn&#39;t have time to experience the return to the dolphins&#39; original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than a boring concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animal protection association Animalia&#39;s goal is that the use of all wild animal species in circuses would be prohibited in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Protection Act that is being prepared.
This group also includes dolphinariums.
To support the demand, Animalia&#39;s executive director Tuomivaara will participate today, September 1. to the organized demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
In the demonstration organized at the Japanese embassy in Helsinki, a stand is taken against the dolphin hunting season that is starting in Japan.
During the hunting season, around 2,300 dolphins are captured or cruelly killed every year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin demands that Kyiv open negotiations regarding a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against separatists in the eastern parts of the country and immediately start negotiations on the &quot;statehood&quot; of the breakaway region, Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin&#39;s demand for the government in Kiev to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equal partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help separatists take over the region, effectively forcing the Ukrainian government to grant independence to the newly declared Novorossiya it may turn to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state TV channel Kanava 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to recapture the separatist-controlled region of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently christened the region &quot;Novorossiya&quot;, &quot;New Russia&quot; - a term reminiscent of the days of glory before the Russian superpower revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said the planned peace talks are an &quot;illusion&quot; as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
&quot;We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of southeastern Ukraine. This way, the interests of the people living there are taken into account,&quot; he says.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s reference to &quot;statehood&quot; is related to a broader independence issue that has been discussed for months with Kiev&#39;s leadership as it tries to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There can be no discussions between Ukraine and Russia on this issue, Peskov says, &quot;because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine.&quot;
A Kremlin spokesman&#39;s remarks, aimed at correcting a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of Putin&#39;s comments, emphasized that the Russian administration is dealing with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions differently than it did with Crimea, when it effectively seized a region of 2 million people, the majority of whom are ethnic Russians.
It would be significantly more difficult for Moscow to annex even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian, and because according to opinion polls before the conflict, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give Ukraine&#39;s local governments the right to negotiate their own trade deals and foreign relations, effectively giving the Kremlin power in the region that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia&#39;s main fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historical coastal sites.
The area between Russia&#39;s Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and smelters that produce vital products for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the core of Ukraine over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest demands for the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equal partners, after the rebels made further advances last week after Russian tanks and troops entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the city of Novoazovsk by Russian-backed separatists is the start of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to a massive fortification of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. With a population of half a million, Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow strip of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko addressed European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, pleading for more action to prevent future Russian aggression in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
&quot;We will soon reach a point of no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not make decisions on direct action; leaders proposed drafting additional sanctions to be put in place if the Ukraine crisis flares up again under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored divisions and 1,000 troops moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the embattled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers blockaded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan&#39;s opening goal was scored by Japanese talent Keisuke Honda already in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half Sulley Muntari scored first and a little later Jeremy Menez from a penalty kick.
Lazio also got a penalty in the final moments of the game after their goal, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez blocked Antonio Candreva&#39;s shot.
Lopez moved to Milan this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of Milan&#39;s former attacking icon Inzaghi, the San Siro stadium was only half full.
The audience for the match was announced as 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged that hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancee and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a number of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were released on the internet as a result of a large-scale celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of The Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, such as top models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne resident Grecko have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, &quot;this is sickening.&quot;
All personal communication and photos should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Grecko, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and said that the victims &quot;feel defiled&quot;.
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless by the pool.
Palmer&#39;s film credits include e.g. the movie “Love and Honor” with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence&#39;s representative told TMZ that &quot;this is a brazen invasion of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen got angry at the hacker in his tweet: &quot;Publishing pictures stolen from a cell phone is no different than selling a stolen product.&quot;
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, if only from a legal point of view.

It felt like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already 0-2 down in the match, but won the match 3-2.
In the fourth set, Finland made a miraculous comeback from six points behind.
Cuba already led the set 16-10, but after that the Finns started to get excited.
However, hundreds of Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish soccer fans have taken Europe by storm in recent days.
More than 8,000 Finnish fans are present at the World Basketball Championships in Bilbao, Spain.
