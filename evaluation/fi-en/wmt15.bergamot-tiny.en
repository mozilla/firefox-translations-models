The City of Juankoski joins the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The joint was unanimously approved by the Kuopio City Council on Monday.
The Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next be held in 2016.
After Juankoski’s accession, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

At the top of the discussion are plans for expanded nuclear cooperation.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," Putin said, according to news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, who are called aided by the Russian army by Kiev and the West, tried to push beyond Ukrainian troops from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery to avoid getting a chance to shoot residents of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It surprised me that people arrived in the very early evening.
There were expected visitors over two days, says Tom Kangas, a promotional director.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Again next year.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, so there is no pop in store, Kangas assures.
Finland will enter into force on Tuesday to restrict the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the National Police Board for permission to buy or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as a precursor to explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide, for example, in cleaning and detergents, but concentrations do not usually exceed limit values.
Nitrometethane is used in acceleration driving, for example.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be retained and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster charged with hotel rape of Nairn and Pitlochry
A trial awaits a trial of rape at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing before a hearing before Glasgow's High Court.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's Scotland's hotel in Perthshire province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman with her "being in an unconscious state, asleep, and being incapable of making a decision for himself."
Webster is charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Upper Highlands, on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held at a higher court at a higher court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario missed - Premier League - Evening News
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened on Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch at a completely different attitude from Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his top breezes.
The Italian lost three quality goal posts and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already accepted the player as their favourite will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotell's role of Luis Suarez, who had traveled to Barcelona, alongside Daniel Sturridge, as the team's second striker.
Instead of Balotelli, the team star sparkled by the tip of midfield diamonds Raheem Sterling, poking a 3-0 win over an important opening goal past Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than the Balotellian, is between the opponent's lines than a fish in water.
The feature is not common to a player who speeds at a speed of about 34 kilometres per hour on the grass at best.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of praise for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman told after the match how Liverpool have systematically developed a player from a northwestern columnist growing at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The papers, including the Los Angeles Times, have been asking what orchestra he'll take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start in her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in our country’s music life for over a hundred years, including by prescribing a large amount of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I look forward to our future collaboration," he says.

Pikepudas.
Woman Volley of a Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team stumbled to league riser Vampulan Athletes in the final of a training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula twisted to five stretching a match of 3-2 wins.
The last set WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead.
The battle was good, but Vampula was a bit better in defensive play and passport play, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six were risible in that six-foot-4 American center Jennifer Keddy's back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as centers.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injuries, was able to play and formed WoVo’s most firepower combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
Vampula’s best part was a skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, of whom WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday with a "trader" at 6pm in an official practice game.
We'll meet at a sports college a second time on Sunday.

Ovarian cancer is more likely to die in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and reduced access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed more than 1,100 Australians in 2005 with a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer and found that only 35 percent of women, more than five years after diagnosis.
Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
STUDENT: New Drugs May Slow Lung and OvasiC
Scientists reviewed women's health history over seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socioeconomic status also affected survival.
In older women and with cancer spread more widely at the time of diagnosis, the likelihood of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities have a lower likelihood of coping with ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynotical oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their admissions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
In addition, while remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distanceing is decreasing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors to help specialists treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients being treated far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of geographical location, undershooting, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
Elisha Neave, a family mother living in the 33-year-old Gold Coast in March 2012, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the bevel parking activities in the Friendship Park, located next to Hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the town plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be publicly displayed at a service point in Osvitta.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the city plan change, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobiling operations related to tourism in the area.
A park area is to be formed to include the existing area between the Friendship Park and its river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available on site between 15 November and 30 April.
A designated number of refuelling points may also be placed in the area.
Maintenance traffic will also be allowed in the new parkland.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
Sled parking and pattern change have provoked loud opposition.
Residents of neighborhoods have been snarling to sound as well as worried about emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been studied, and observations exceeding the guide values have not been identified in the studies.
The renewed equipment is lower than old.
The Friendship Park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, the hotel's safari customers would have to be transported to safari slots slots by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area of Friendship Park is also sufficiently large for sleds than places presented as substitute departures, such as the boat dock east of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location, because operations can expand into the Ounaspaviljonki area in the future, for example.
Consolidating parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City’s goal is to create a good framework for business operations by setting up sufficiently high-quality areas in logistically and functionally beneficial locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre sub-universal plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
Depreciation of owner-occupiers is reflected in garden stores
A reduction in the number of homeowners, particularly in the under 35-year-olds, may lead to a reduction in turnover in garden stores by tens of millions, while today's young consumers reach a "main target group" for horticultural sales. The Financial Times reported on a study by the UK Horticultural Trade Association (HTA).
According to a Financial Times report, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the amount of money spent by homeowners in gardening.
The investigation had also revealed that more people are living in highly urbanised apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the forecourt is increasingly paved into a parking lot. These factors also threaten the horticultural sector, estimated to be worth around quid n.5% a year.
In a major London region, home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43 per cent in six years, with the least amount of money spent on homeowners per household across the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Hopilcules Association (RHS), an increase in renting of homes or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people can not grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden adviser, says that "for example, plants grown in transferable growing containers are particularly popular among homeowners because such growing containers can be included in the move if necessary."
According to the HTA report, 1997-2005 was a boom in the reconstruction of the horticultural sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, worse than last year's March and April weather.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over spying report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on an investigation into American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Embassy Chargout and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spy target for U.S. and UK intelligence agencies.
Turkish news agencies say Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major nations have spied on each other.
A previous report of spying on the German main intelligence agency Ankara ran for an angryer reaction in the Turkish government.

Majorca's Magalufi Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Those who witnessed the incident provided evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the Calvi-Herical City Board at Majorca's Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvi, Calvi, on a resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by movements and bar owners of the Magalufi area known for damp celebrations.
Chief Inspector Jos- Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody after several businesses on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena is home to most of Magalufi’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, who made the incident, evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the Calviche City Board at Majorca's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper published a countrywide newspaper, wrote that nightclub owners were angered by the bias of authorities, which significantly complicated their business.
"It's not money left to do so, it's a business owner who said to the court.
You're not destroying our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in newspaper headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video circulated online of an 18-year-old British vacationer doing oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, island officials have tried to curb the intoxicated and uncontrolled use of Magalufi holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcohol-based pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was shot, was ordered to close for a year, and a nightclub owner and pub crawl organiser, Carnage, was jointly fined €55,000.
Above all, Magalufi's tourist destination, popular among young British tourists, has also become popular with a so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents as people have jumped from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip region returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israel-Half War and schools remained closed as the region recovered from fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in communities of southern Israel bombed by rockets, but the trail of fighting is still evident.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashosh daycare, workers removed fragments from walls and slippery before children arrived after a rocket hitting a daycare center.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a Kibbuts, an Israeli commune known as Saad, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Shani Bart, daughter of 11-year-old daughter of Bart, thinks returning to school after a long time feels "slightly strange."
"We've had some tough times at times when we didn't go anywhere from home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited kibbutz near the Gaza border to provide support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of communities in the border area like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the people of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are sceptical about a return after Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in a community of four-year-old boy.
The Education Department said more than 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border, which was subject to heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, including Hamas' demand to remove the Israeli-Egypt blockade and reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in a war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected in Egypt later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children were killed.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead. It said at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no conclusive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai employee.
In battles, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 U.N.-run schools converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still sheltered and fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of school the previous week.
"I hope that school will open soon and get to school again, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old living sheltered at a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used metric, house prices have risen most to seven years in Australia's winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments, which measures the Australian capital's house prices, rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices for the summer, July and August total rose 4.2%, more than in the same months after 2007.
Prices increased annually by 10.9 per cent, more than twice as many as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of rising prices.
RP Data results show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent in Sydney and 11.7 percent in Melbourne the previous year.
The housing market for Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average price rise is between five and six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
Lawless said the spring, which began in Australia, will increase the number of homes on sale over the coming months, a real test for the housing market.
"Paracing the rise in sales of homes to be auctioned, a generally high selling rate and still persistent low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise in the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
A new museum and visual art have attracted record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Festival said on Monday that they had set a record for visitors, compared to 14,500 interested parties at the Hetkinen event this summer.
We are not used to these figures.
People have been hanging out of doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to Serlachius Museums for the whole year will approach 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located mid-Morning of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always phenomena when opened.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped the art season will continue well over the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the art museum.
Police are investigating four thefts committed in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into by a window.
The offender had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel from a truck's tanks had been stolen on Syväojankatu.
The boat with outboard motors had been taken from the marina of petäinenniska between Sunday and Monday.

On the inside side, the text "OIVA" read on the nose side.
A couple of suspects stealing police already caught up.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
A police dog was penalized and a man in his 20s from Paltamo was found in the woods to hide under a fir tree.
On Monday, police caught another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine charges murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a cajander man born in 1977.
Prosecutors said the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law spouse and another man and shot a shot at a homeowner he suspected to be a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed another man with him was a shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car with a party burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will give a judgment in the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the July and August heats, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature during the summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the gauge showed 32.8 degrees Celsius.
Lenny Henry says, “My father never gave me a hug.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a migrant family from Jamaica with seven children in Dudley, Britain's Midlands region, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19 years old. The relationship between son and father was distant.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, based in part on a fictional conversation with his father and developed based on a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he reflects a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read the father.
His face never showed up, just a voice said, "Let the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket.
My parents, my sister Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited a pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a pint of beer or the beauty of cricket dust.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter at Dudley to get an idea of what his father's life must have been, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
Melting plants are a little brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthish depths with flames, smoke and soot and bring to mind a sentence.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie down in a tub, and slowly began to sing to himself as he washed the smelthouse dirt away from himself.
Walking around the smelter, I understood that he had been doing that work for years to get us food to the table, and I started to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness offered by parents.
My father never hugged, never saying he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to get sick shortly before she died we started to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie daughter, Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend to French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why aren't Dawn and I friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of a mother.
When I started to suffer from a heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do an about-face.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's known, short beard perhaps illustrates his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in theatre making.
Next up were the comedy of misfortunes and August Wilson's Fences.
Making a theater offers a different experience from sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry, when he was in the business, only a 16-year-old factory worker.
One of the counter jockey spotted him on stage doing impersonations and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-'70s. "For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he tells me.
Henry learned when he worked.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living stardom and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny in the New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager held stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show featuring people wearing black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Even though my position was strange and reprehensible, I got to work at huge events and learned how to handle the audience.
Still, "British TV's award-winning, perennial favourite and lightweight entertainment show" was at the same time a "growing parody of black people."
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 80s, in which both conprooked fun and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as a chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on advertising, documentary, TV shows and movie parts, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC, he said to himself, "What are you next, Len – now it looks like you're just trampling on your place or you're going to go by side tracks."
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't exactly taught to us at school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare subject raised fears in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
To date words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry pronounced 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verses, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
In the end, the play was a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn't quite happen.
Soon after, Henry played the lead role in the comedy of fascination.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point I thought, “Obvious, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems with the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his mission to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to manage for 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.' "
Instead, the instructor's assistant indicated that the performance would resume as soon as the problem has been rectified.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me sighed relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
“You are part of a play, stay in your role.”
Henry 'Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning to "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was well received, so it was a sign of gods; "This is what you have to do."
Henry says this, of course, in a voice.
I meant I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
But Henry is still essentially a comedian: small baby humors interrupt our conversations as he switches from one impersonation to another.
Absenting from the stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting instant thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsty for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater at times when I feel like it, but in general, it doesn't excites me in the same way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going to go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning of the whole journey, the middle stage and the end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.

Kenya drawing up register of officials to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun drawing up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register for the registry in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement announced.
The government suspects thousands of people will continue to be paid after leaving their civil service duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an inspection carried out earlier this year, at least 10,000 million spent on wages and other financial irregularities of "ghost workers" were spent a month.
The government suspects salaries will be paid into account even after a person has died or left his official duties, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the registry over the next few weeks at identification centers to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, a government statement said.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this for no proper reason will be removed from payrolls.
"This measure significantly rationalizes the public sector, as this defines how many people actually work in their duties. In addition, this will purge payrolls at both levels of the government. This is how the problem of "ghost workers" solves," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year of Seinäjoki may be in deficit of EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on current budget preparation, the annual margin is falling short of a deficit of about 9.4 million.
Possible means of improving efficiency were the complexity of the scope and level of services, purchases of services, the sale of assets and grants, and the increase in tax and payment revenue.
EUR 8.5 million of the EUR 10 million qualifier target for investments.
There is no relief from the situation of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient increase in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a five per cent cut in central government transfers further undermine the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to rebalance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a goal consistent with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The city board returned the proposals made to prepare for the management team.
The City Board's proposals are the basis of budget preparation at a council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal will proceed through a board hearing to the city board and city council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of 'running' government
In all, 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
The Hurriyet Daily News reports that 14 senior police officials were among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were in contact with last December's corruption investigations targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising a large criminal torque and following phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at that time) said the actions of police officers were part of the planned action against him and others in power against him by the police officers.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting journalists that not all schools have opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not celebrated at every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukkhov, who is a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will come back here at last and that children can learn lessons that will be of benefit to them in the future.
The first day of school celebrations traditionally includes children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry says a defamatory tweet was unauthorized
A defamatory photo of the Democratic district attorney was sent from a verified Twitter account of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a devising image of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of hearing allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't accept a tweet and I've deleted it," a later release said.
Perry's backup failed to respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon of Travis's district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's post when he declined to resign, leading to a gathering of a large jury in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet's headline read: "I don't always drive drunk, three times the maximum number of dollars allowed... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The study was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor based in San Antionio, assigned to the mission by a Republican ensembler.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His powerful legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the allegations and said the law on which the farthest governor of Texas is accused is unclear in the constitutional position.
Perry cut 7.5 million government subsidies to a government public-of-state anti-violence unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector accusations when Lehmberg declined to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a formal complaint by a monitoring team leaning to the left.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry gushed to a tie to close to a draw by posting a photo of himself jogging on a lake with the text "Here Comes, South-Carolina!".
Berkeley says housing market is 'normal' again
One of London's main developers has warned that the South-East England housing market has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London housing has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price rises while fearing a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-quality developer Berkeley, said Monday that "a running from the beginning of a financial year the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the spike in 2013" and added that this has enabled a "permanent operating environment."
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought packs to the capital.
According to data from the Land Registry, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus well exceeding the average of England and Wales, which stood at 6.7 per cent.
Average selling prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth of the previous year, reaching a rise of 4%35,000 by the end of April.
But the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric of a possible "kartaver" before the general election of May.
Foxtons, a London real estate agent, warned last week that April's mortgage report, which reported tighter lending orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Hamptons International, a real estate agent, has lowered its 2015 forecast for London property prices. It said prices are falling by three per cent because the index of homeowners' opinions on prices has already started to weaken.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped to a quarter year-on-year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
But demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, boosting revenue from properties sold to more than 2.00 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right kind of product at the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained buoyant."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April. This is almost a third more than at the time of the pre-existing peak of economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 percent to a year ago, resulting in plural ploughs plunging plunging plunging plunges by NL0 million by 18 percent to 6%.
Pidgley said Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's year earnings match market expectations.
Analysts agree that a full-year pre-tax profit is quip quip quip.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at a price of FOTT.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold images of 100 other stars leaked Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's nudging photos online.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for "ascretifying invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and all posting of Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be recounted.
Images originally posted on the 4chan photo release page appeared to have fallen into the wrong hands because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars targeted by hacking claims to include dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how many of the images are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those watching photos taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude photos of me are WELCOMINGS, don't you understand."
Let me end this right from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande banned the authenticity of the images of the star.
Only us have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's praise for a new novel about love and j
They dissolved, it described what happened best, gradually they came off each other like a cardboard box left out of rain.
Only from time to time he heard from a woman that he was too serious, cumbersome, intense, disconnected, and maybe also a bit spichy.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized a spiper.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
His latest victim in his spike had been an early-onset affair, which had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his solitary boredom, and it might have brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomon had untamed hair, and he was a delicate beauty with a cheerful heart of the cheerful nature, from the village of the north, which was even rougher and farther from all of all that of the Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern assumed was his aunt. Auntie had inherited a house in a damp but paradonic valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows holding the whole place to their own, the garden grew weeds that resembled giant cabbageheads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for a Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Nominees to be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailini on a broken terrace chair in the midst of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both of them, listening to an absentusively listening to the reception, through which the whole country heard relenting music and reassuring news, when Ailini's christened sun-lined feet brought to Kevernni's mind a song that had been sunbathed to Kevern's mind, which had been sun-wrenched, singing, had been sun-twifted to a long-standing black performer.
Your foot is too big.
In principle, such songs were too aggressive, and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, as the word undo.
Public opinion achieved what laws and decrees had not been achieved: just as people chose to read heroes memoirs, cookbooks and romances, for music, they prefer ballads.
To go wild for the day, Kevern began to key to an imaginary piano and sing the serenadia to the big feet of Ailini with a cheeky comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers to his mouth.
This is what his father had done before the letter "j" escaped his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was small.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let me know a word with j and you couldn't remember to raise two fingers in your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't it now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz had not been specifically declared denial either, it was not just played.
Improvisation was no longer in vogue.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit performed through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's half-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailini that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailini's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when the popular singers were not black.
There were no laws or coercions needed here.
The obedience society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude – gratitude, for being like spared by permeation – the principle that each group did it natural things.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with afro-carbance ancestry are best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, those originally borne were like inherently gifted with electrical equipment, so it was up to them to make sure that each family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When SE, WHAT HAPPENED, IF EVENTS, EVENTS came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not hurried to bounced in fear of being accused of flaring flaming and fearing that those flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving the labneh yoghurt and burned their homewards, and continued to their lives with a look.
Let everyone act on their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how Kevern's just-singing words had ever been dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"It's not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for bigfoot people.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but an abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage leaves.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailun.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was funny to Dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of view.
There's nothing to see in the whole world other than Ailinnin's huge, crow black hairy softness.
There's nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for it.
"I think you're attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This was no help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite his mild eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair while knocking down a receiver and spilling a wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only for elder flowers, so that's something he couldn't use to collusion.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking, like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern regretd for Ailinnin, both for his own, unnecessarily cruel words and the fear that was reflected in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he would hit him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the frigid northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure it had basically been similar to life here.
It's the same huge, frigid sea that rippled against them.
The same confused men, though EVENTS after EVENT, even more pale and fiendious than their smugglers and shattering grandmothers, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare resist or toy them.
A thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Imma first – kissing had become the most common word of erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote of impeccable love ballads pumping out the receiver – impress first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, too, because already being lunated in itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but Kevern's deepness of grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed his going – just as his traveling companion watched Kevern from a window upstairs – a man who was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He had a pity feeling sorry for Kevern and men overall, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A bent, bent, shameful, slain man who had lost all the will to fight – why did he feel that the sight was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that before this moment he had seen such a thing?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the just-picemed event, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, who worked at a private institution of the General Opinion-measures of the General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of low- and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country where the reduction of violence, or even the end of violence, was most likely to consider the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been accomplished, and much more has yet to be done," he wrote, "so that the natural aggressiveness of a people who have fought thousands of years and most often won, are rarely known for the past days of destruction, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where, despite church tarts spanning hedges, human lesions are rarely known over time.
Some things cannot be removed completely.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it generates.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, gobbergly about stories of winning adversity, and swear by the names of marital and family life virtues, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty holds in its unpeated grip, both rural communities and urban communal areas, and there is evidence of a new, more evil-scientific harbing chunking in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum took a look to the ground.
I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I am against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or malsolicism, others usually call inherent energy and physical strength.
I wish I wonder if it was to destroy the country’s fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, flamingo pink LED light proclaimed an instruction that Ofnow had distributed to land for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to me, apologize.
Speaking better than silence and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a hutless voice when he was sure his director had finished, "and I just want to say we're not as effective healing as we think we were ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SIIH, WHAT HAPPENED.
This time, though, we do not pour out our hatred and mistrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "as you describe as 'mistakes' the things that our grandparents may have done or not to do.
You also go too far to say they poured out 'hate of hate and distrust of others'."
In someone like you, you shouldn't have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we're not talking about 'we' or 'those'.
There was nothing 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that is all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "anyone group of society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, whether it was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk about it more – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to pass on accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way of doing them.
But for what the past does there be no lessons to learn from it --
The past exists to forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, going to work as normal, he was hit by a motorcyclist riding on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as "attached and furious."
Collations happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning to strike; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho army officials have banned a crackdown on a government sprawl and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and taken over government buildings in Maseru, the capital.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him he had a fatal threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said the military thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics." Police have been told to try to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotero Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligences that some police force officers are trying to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
Clayson Monyepa, the South African government spokesman, said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary enterprise.
"While no one has claimed to refute the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to fully correspond to the characteristics of the revolutionary attempt," he says.
Lesotho's army officials say soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, with a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions over disagreements from a large coalition of government disagreements.
He thus denies disparageing government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft, an IT firm, has set up a large data center in a place in Uusimaa, the location of which the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
The center is already fully equipped and connected to the network, according to Microsoft.
It's a multi-million dollar investment for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani were previously referred to as the centre’s place.
Microsoft will close its Oulu office altogether, which will take up a job for about 500 people.
Microsoft has announced that it will close to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft Communications Director, tells STT that the company does not comment on how many personnel the new data center employs.
The creation of a data center in Uusimaa was reported by Kauppalehti on Monday.
Man charged with hitting girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man has been charged with driving a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving on a girl at a junction in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, banned charges at a Dundee Sheriff's Session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a variety of device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant point-and-eye camera, such as a Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both costing about buckling.
I personally took these pictures at a family celebration using a number of different cameras, each costing less than phy buckling.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproof.
In addition, set camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or camera and video camera combinations have a setting to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
Plus, before you jump in the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can withstand depth of just 5 feet, others depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Discover both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to composure the image, while action cameras often don't have that feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and you can either make a picture finish or fail.
Take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forkring, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors to your photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you will see.
Try to get close to the object being photographed.
This is an important advice when photographing land, but even more important underwater because of the low light conditions.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning the photographer must be close to the target to fill the object up to frames of the whole picture.
China won't let Hong Kong pick its leaders; protesters swear revenge
China's parliament decided Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to select candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing unrest of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark a spark to the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong business district after activists began to plan and enforce protests for just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress to effectively let the Communists power eradicate any candidate who disobey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says Democratic Party president, Legispute Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to Hong Kongers.
Obviously, we are working with autocratic governance.
Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the committee of China's People's Congress, defended China's administration, saying that standing as a general nomination when choosing Hong Kong leader would be too "caotic."
Since 1997, when the UK ceded Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents of the region to be allowed to choose its own leaders from 2017.
China's leaders say Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee, which is administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "loving the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the region's largest and most striking protests for years.
The democracy campaign was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in rain in front of Hong Kong's main governing buildings.
At the protest, movement organizers announced the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would bring about protest strikes in the coming weeks.
But they apparently did not give details, fearing it would lead to problems with authorities.
In a press release posted online, organizers said the movement "to hold the Occupy Central stunt as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance of dialogue has failed and the takeover of the centre will happen.
Hong Kong officials have been preparing for a Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings. Police and barricades were at the scene.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fuelled by the feeling of the residents slowly losing power to their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
What's more, there is a fear of Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, disappearing under Beijing's growing pressure.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood – the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says Legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concerns that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
This image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media have also shown stories showing that Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists are hents of western powers that incites a revolution.'
This summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands of senior pro-democratic protests in the region took part.
U.S. prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet demand by establishing Britain's first form of luxury travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Pantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure maximum memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart said there was also a security aspect to the service.
Service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the brim.
When combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest possible level of transportation to the university.
The company's representative said no bookings have yet been received because the service has only just been set up, but added that "students will start placing orders over the next few weeks."
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay 9% tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies at 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
But the National Student Association criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn Dunn, vice-president of the organization's college section, "this service plan seems to be really far from a student majority of life."
Many who start their studies this month are starting to start their studies are upset by the level of living when the financial subsidies available in the form of loans and grants have fallen behind a staggering rise in basic living expenses. Only next is we to start thinking about where thousands could be found to be used for something as simple as reaching a campus.

Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spain striker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea confirmed, but the replacement entered almost the same door opening.
Chelsea announced a four-year contract since they had hired French tip Loic Remy's neighboring club QPR.
The purchase price is EUR 13 million, according to press reports.
Torres, 30, will move to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool with a record cranny of 4-010m four years ago but never met expectations.
His decision also came to a failed trip to Manchester United by Japanese player Shinji Kagawa.
As expected, Kagawa returns to Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU move.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's recent contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be a Dortmund man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment," Kagawa said.
Another Bundesliga club in Berlin's Hertha is confirmed by Salomon Kalou.
The Ivory Coast national team striker will move to Hertha from French side Lille, with an estimated transfer of around 3 million euros.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played for Chelsea from 2006 to 12.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Justice Department of the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return to the old working provisions, which were recently amended.

Despite a meeting between representatives of the prison workers' organisation and the Justice Department, there was no agreement, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are under way," Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of DG Enforcement of the Courts, told BNR.
Members of the Home Office Trade Association are also expected to join the protest by the prison workers' organisation.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted onto the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was the epitome of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch-black U.S. game and beat Ukraine with his second-half blood-stopping solutions.
But Salin transferred all credit to wolf fans, and did it in style:
I was going to get out there at the end of the day, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, I just blurry, there was nothing.
That noise and a white crowd sea was almost too much for me.
The gym's power moments included nine pinnacles at a rapid pace, ball-bropping, record lines and a tricky everywhere where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode that it all worked out.
They come from somewhere, now insanely important place, Sasu enthused.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see others catching up with the plot.
It caught on the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so it's no wonder his example put the whole team on a flying flight that was too much for the big and heavy-handed Ukrainian five.
Finland at World Cup after 32 years off: The previous ones reminded me of an outrageous refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right), who is carrying the bags, was Finland's head coach at the World Cup tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since Finland's men's volleyball team last played in a World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as an all-rounder.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament like yesterday's day: it was a fiery match against France in the early stages.
"In that match-fixing balls, the umpiring game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had settled down on the backline by now.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it to 2-3, and after that, the pasmas went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland will be among the world’s champions again, when the Polish World Cup tournament gets off to a start on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
Players' strength values are about the same as they used to be, but there's more quality and skill now.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is even faster," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to go from the start.
Then it could be tight,” Kosonen said.
Seppo Cricket
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on a win-win match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder in a World Cup tournament.
Let's hope we're going to peter out 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen, a sports legend, was the national team's number two coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in a Tunisia match.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: 'This is what men deserve all thanks'
When Merethe Mikkelsen from Norway and his dogs got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
At the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog in the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it on a little bit, but its legs didn't just carry," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said no help from police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
As evening fell, things were starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway's highest mountain on Galdhzhpggen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog amid a mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomat in a message.
A German man with an outing mattress with him also happened to arrive soon.
From the mattress, Cita was given stretchers like a stretcher to which an injured dog was attached.
A German man came to the scene for a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a moment, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a hiking mattress.
Soini said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain went slowly.
After about an hour and a half, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
The chords answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
By the night of Monday, the Soinis were home.
They had been happy with Mikkelsen: I'm told Cita is feeling better!

The suggestive name of the opening episode raises questions.
Finland’s most popular soap opera Beautiful and Brave returns from a summer break today.

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years to live to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). That means a number of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, a misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, for example muscle weakness, tricky walking and toe-toe-slip glint.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day and took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I was walking and running differently than everyone else.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon operations to straighten his feet. After surgeing, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he tells me.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 years and die before I turned 25, and in between I'd slowly lose my full ability to function.
I went through this by myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not worsened as much as he thought he had and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, 'Dam honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair'.
I think you suffer from a much less dangerous disease.
Some genetic tests showed he diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained to me what CMT disease was, I thought I had put off," he tells me.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to illness.
100 migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrians and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles in central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Police said migrants had paid around €3,000 each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
There are plenty of illegal immigrants through Macedonia, a population of a couple of million, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled Syria's bloody civil war.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on September 18.
In a press release, Mogwai said voting is an opportunity for Scots to happen only once in a lifetime.
In the past, actor Sean Connery, among others, has given his support for independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to Scottish people to remain part of Britain.
In Gallup, independence supporters have been at a loss.

Areva has provided Teollisuuden Voima with TVO an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3.

Nastola donated a 1.4-acre beach plot to Bottas - worth about 60,000 euros
The Nastola municipal board donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to formula driver Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Kärkjärvi from Villähde.
The local government showed a fair sporting mind and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the property was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas' talent plot has farm buildings - seven in all.
The municipality will unload them all but one this year.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the property within two years.
We are honored to have enjoyed having a stay of birthplace and want to be here in the future.
Valtteri has come to primary schools every year to tell about his sporting careers and life.
And hopefully it will continue to happen, the mayor says.
The municipal manager reckons the capital of a beachfront property to be worth between €40000 and €60,000.
The beach is low and child friendly.
The area has been owned by a municipality for more than ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has kept successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World javelin champion Aki Parviainen and aerobics world champion Tuuli Matinsalo got detached house from the municipality and built hulking single-family homes.
But they didn't stay in Nastola, they sold their properties and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then moved elsewhere after a change in life situation.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syyrakki inches and believes Bottas will remain in his home municipality.
Hull hires striker Hernandez club with record sum
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguay national team man Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will exchange Hull from Italian club Palermo for 9.5 million, or about 12 million euros.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season as Palermo beat Serie B to take the Italian premiership.
With Uruguay, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup finals, Hernandez came on as a substitute in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short period of time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said they also acquired Senegal's national team captain from Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russian space test fails to kill gees sent to sexual journey
The five small gecks sent by Russia to proliferation in space have died, the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The genas traveled on a Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive performance of gecouscuses and the use of gecologicals in a weightless state.
One male geckle and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of eggs in gecous, for example.
The effects of the effects on the gums can be used to anticipate the impact of weightlessness on humans in a similar state for longer periods of time, the New Statesman illustrated in July.
Roscosmos says the time of gequities dying and cause of death or cause of death are being determined.
According to news agency Interfax, passengers christened "sexgeics" froze.
The surprise is also evidenced by the fact that fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 ride survived the trip with difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of acting as a recruiter of a Syria-based jihadist group.
French officials announced Sunday.
Authorities were able to track down the man after he lured a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother, who lives in Istanbul, instead alerted authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told authorities the family had no family in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, according to officials, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, officials have been concerned that radicalising young people attracting to the wars of Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Officials estimate that about 800 French nationals or those registered in France have travelled to Syria, returned to Syria during the last conflict, or are currently planning to leave Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The basketball team's hopes of a further place are at play when Finland faces Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If an opening defeat to the United States was expected, Ukraine will be among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for a place to go.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first fight of the Games on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter kicked 16 points.
Pooh Jeter a quick guy, but we have played against them before and we need to get our standard defense right," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in its losses to the United States yesterday.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that we will see a normal wolf pack on the pitch, Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged nude photos spread online - some confirmed to be authentic
A number of nude images allegedly featured public figures are spreading on the Internet.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "poaching campaign."
Entertainment website TMZ has posted an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that would appear to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone posting (on the Internet) stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives are threatened.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that images spread about her are genuine.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy effort was seen for this.
I sympathize with anyone who was the victim of hacking," he writes, according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says images of her own name are fake.
There are also genuine or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
FC Honka is currently in final place in Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match illustrate well the club's confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goaltending coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a struggle that ended in a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive end mistakes, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with poor defensive play.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and for that reason defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With the player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard to get out of here sometime," Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent to some extent to Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player, and you don't have to work, then I'm sure you're on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
But Kuqi also reminded us that players can't expect immediate success when playmates keep changing.
This season has not had the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially on the defensive end, the crowd has changed.
That's the main reason we're in this place," Kuqi noted.
Honka is a series jumbo after a VPS loss, tied to second-to-last TPS.
There are seven more rounds of betting league to go, so the Espoons still have time to avoid relegation to number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop now.
We are definitely not going to drop out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala gushed.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to TV series.

Lars von Trier, 58, is known for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
To television, he directed the Kingdom series in the 1990s.

From Ice Bucket Challenge participant, a jaw dislocated
Briton Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured over her to damage the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken to treatment after roaring an Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured over her to damage the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold I just roared, but when I roared, I felt my jaw was getting stiffened," he tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to emergency services.
A 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to hospital, where the chin was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation, and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Viewpoint to howls of wolves (kin): How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
It was a great vibe today.
So said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland played in the European Championship finals against France at the Athens Marouss ballpark.
He didn't exaggerate Pehkonen.
I remember a game when I was there.
So were the 100 Finns who shouted a noise into the otherwise empty hall of 20,000 spectators.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the troops of 100 Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships were a search period for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by beating, among other things, a Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möttölä into the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution that many people disagreed on.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a long way wise, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
In the Athens Games, a total of slightly over 100 Finns were present.
That included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there are many of them.
This phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I don't think anyone can say an exact figure for Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number is in between, it's an unimaginable amount.
Here's to explain to sports sociologists.
In a global global economy, companies are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and sons are successful around the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sports Sociology.
I'm sure both Spain and the volleyball World Cup in Poland will have Finns looking for an experience.
A shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There must be an attraction to sports.
Itkonen makes sports popular culture a part.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses cannot be moved.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and players to throw themselves into top-level sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and national team activities were put on a pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to produce their top-level sport, in which the sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can ball sports transfer this massive interest to home shows, too?
On average, basketball and volleyball play for hundreds or just over 1,000 spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good, and he doesn't necessarily give an answer that would promise very good to the species.
Another school of thought remains of interest to shift.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready to experience the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are of no oddities.
That's a challenge for companions in the midst of a thrill.
Confirmation of Bottas property - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach home plot.
The municipal board approved the disposal of a 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
A leisure apartment will go up on the property in the future.
In Nastola, Bottas has been successful since his karting times.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has been acquired by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition-dominated buildings in the area, of which six will be demolished at cost by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved his fourth podium in Formula 1, Belgium, this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup standings.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and has lived in Villähde during his childhood.
He now lives in England, but he goes to Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools as well as youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but I don't think it's for the poor
It is currently introducing and testing them in New York City in the ongoing U.S. Open tennis competition.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are testers of the field's ball characters, but Marcus Giron, an amateur at the top of college players, also thinks of that.
He says the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the leather shirt, from which information is transmitted to the mocking on the shirt and then to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The central unit moac is removed before throwing a shirt into a washing machine.
The fashion house has not given specific time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothing.
Athos, a California resident, has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost buckling bucks for bucks per ounce of buckling and the pesh-sized central unit they require costs two hundred dollars.
The technonacade was also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceed naught for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save on cost.
He developed a system in which later year students borrow their books for nominal compensation, rather than selling books right away.
"My Matthew book would normally have cost cheque cheque; I paid bucks 10 dollars for use for a full semester as well as a hefty sandwich," said 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally have cost stallion bucks of stallion.
Instead, he spent bucksing them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than bucks ,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have access to many ways to reduce those costs.
Students are increasingly ending up using creative approaches such as online stores and Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less for it than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company that holds more than 250 campus bookstores, leasing textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the industry reveal that about a quarter of books from university bookstores this past spring were rental books, according to Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, you can get a new book for just a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larsson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" is nearly ninth buckling, but Chegg.com's online store for special books gets a book for flexing flexibilities n3,000.99.
Buy used
Books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, you can get a "Calculus" book seconded at Chegg.com e-commerce for tune of tune of bucks.
Brigham Young University student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought a book entitled "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" used at Amazon.com for just quid.
A new book would cost buck 48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the Amherst's College Without Walls School at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
At times, the reforms of the new edition are not essential for education.
In this case, you can find an old edition by only a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, you remember to return them and you don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 percent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for a full semester costs about bucks 20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, highlighting pen usage and wear.
Renter, be on your guard: if you forget to return a book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be an issue.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the e-book access is paid to its holder, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc bookshops.
The Chegg store gets an e-book for an e-book for about buckling for six months.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, because several classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different sellers is worth choosing the option.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine in law school, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it allows you to ensure you are looking for a real book.
Before ordering the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He learned this the hard way.
The editorial board of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get a book at full price from a university bookstore.

Nearly double deaths in fires compared to last year
Almost twice as many people have died in the fires this year compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already been killed in 49 different fires in fires so far.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 over 65 years of age.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the last time a worse situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The vast majority of fire deaths occur in housing.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in single-family homes, and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of recaping home fire safety.
At least the functionality of all home smoke alarms should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that initial extinguishing equipment is easily available to use.
All home premises must also have an accessible route of exit.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of the city of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-sum meeting.
Stephen Fairclough watched the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
Youths rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
A TWO teenage hiker was brought to safety after being stranded overnight in the Blue Mountains of Australia's New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking to Govetts Leap on Blackheathi after noon on Sunday.
Relatives worried about young people who had not returned home, and called police from 8 p.m.
A search party of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for the youths, and the two were found at around 11pm near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
Officers spent the night with a couple, and were brought to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
The Ukrainian military said soldiers were given a backing order.
Ukraine says paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks on the ground.
A military spokesman said the other side's gunfire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol ship, which received artillery hits in the Azov Sea off southeastern Ukraine yesterday, sank in the morning, according to a Border Patrol.
Eight marines have been rescued and two remain missing.
The Border Patrol had no certainty about where the ship was fired from.
The separatists said on social media yesterday that they had shot out the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia will not invade Ukraine.
But Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The foreign minister said the Minsk talks today would have to establish an immediate cease-fire between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will respond to potential new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners’ actions, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains cause Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut several roads, scrambled traffic and buried cars under them.
Officials on Sunday said it might take a while to ease the flood, even though rains were forecast to stop Monday.
Heavy rains caught Swedish officials by surprise, and no weather warning was issued for rains in advance.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should 'bine quietly and help France,'" Francois Hollande's main backer says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" towards a socialist president with difficulties, whose composition of a new government did not gain acceptance of the majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said, and deserved applause.
As a dissuasive gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace with France's controversial 35-hour work week despite a new economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, of a debate-pronounced proposal earlier this week, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work in concert with the government.
But Attorney-General Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing to meet dissenting Socialist MPs with differing opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future."
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the Socialists' constant division of divisions between the Socialists and said he did not believe Vallsi's new government would last for a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, who had a duty to form a new government after the former did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve parliament and held his party's election victory in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held a list tip in May's EU elections.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party could split into several competing groups before Hollande's end of the 2017 season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to quickly note that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get even worse.
Good Morning Finland’s hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Poudan were heavily betrayed by the recorded section of the programme.
The 'cause Finland programme posted a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Finnish advertising boutique about the next day’s broadcast, but the recording does not go quite smoothly.
Alm-Siira messes with her words when she tries to utter the word budget session, and his concoction also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their ponies time and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to run live broadcasts as well, according to a Facebook update from Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K, who worked at the magazine photo agency. Pouta, 68, finished third in the series of portraits in 1972.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Helsinki Fredrikinkatu building in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we got over five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture from four to five feet away.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
You can see from Meir's expression that Middle Eastern leaders have had a hard time before.
That's when you got through the competition with pictures of well-known people or events.
It's great that you can succeed with other images these days, as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virusn's downfall photo of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the Helsinki Police’s drug unit has already cost more than five million euros and claimed 30-50 person-years.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki’s doctoral dissertation on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the monitoring of the legality of the police’s operations and the fight against crimes could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, current technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which data collected to determine the crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence, while allowing comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The concept of vegetarian food for 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special press release on the wall of a women’s trip school in Pirkkala caused a food outage on social media, Yle says on its website.
Vegetarian diners!
The vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list we prepare a vegetarian option!
That's what is stated in a 15-year-old press release forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The photo, which spread on social media, has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Service, says to Yle that a forgotten note on the wall is not true and it should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian food option only with parental permission and a doctor’s or nurse’s certificate of vegetarian diet.
The hazard justifies the solution to Yle on the grounds that young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave nutrition short and the absence of meat or chicken can cause wonder to the parents of pupils.
Norwegian Cruise close to bucks buckthorn Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise company, is in talks to buy its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for nil bucklings of bucklings. The information comes from people who are closely involved.
The deal would see Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of  USD 6.8 billion, would have access to luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against larger royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say information about a possible deal may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want to make public because negotiations were not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and an Apollo representative declined to comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise company has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, Mediterranean, Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when revenue was n.5.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also from Miami, sailing with Oceania and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise ships, and a route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was n.1 billion, up six percent from the previous year.
The DPZ billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from rising middle classes of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to become the number one option for these new customers as they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issuance of shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since a 2007 deal worth  dollars worth buckling.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with a combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested n& 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to published reports, Genting accounted for 28 percent of the company, Apollo 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP accounting for 8 percent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises combined account for 82 percent of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document published in connection with the issuance of shares in Prestige Cruise.
The City of Tampere is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city government will support the initiative solidly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral thesis at the University of Tampere, there is a need to end quickly during dolphinariums in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become more common around the world that the concentration of advanced mammary mammary, such as dolphins, in dolphins, is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be seen in Tampere.
The abolition of dolphinarium is not only an issue of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin confirms calls for the downgrading of dolphinarium operations.
Näs’ death is a sad continuation of the sinister history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a point in the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start investigating how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the original dolphin habitation of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will experience more than a stimulant concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Convention on the Protection of Animals (Occupational Animalia) aims to prohibit the use of all wild species in circuses under the prepared animal welfare law.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support the requirement, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins to be held today on 1 September.
The protest at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against a dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed each year, either for dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called for the Ukrainian government to end fighting against separatists in the country's east and immediately start talks on the "stateism of the exiting region," Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy ever since violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to virtually grant the recently declared Novorosts independence, which allows it to grastrate Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military's efforts to retake the separatist-dominated eastern Donetsk-ready region of Donetsk and Luhansk, which was captured by separatists in March after Moscow joined the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula itself on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently dipped the region as the "Novorostress," "New Russia" -- this term resembles the glory days of the revolutions of Russian great power.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said planned peace talks were "obvious" as long as Ukrainian politicians are implementing campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the Southeastern Ukraine state. This will take into account the interests of people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "state-to-stateism" relates to wider independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in an attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking areas of being threatened by their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the independence they need to the eastern regions, Peskov says.
There can be no discussions on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin representative's interim note, which was intended to correct Putin's comments as "false interpretation," emphasized that the Russian regime is dealing with separatists in the eastern regions differently from what it saw in Crimea, effectively taking over an area of ethnically Russian population of 2 million people.
Moscow would be significantly more difficult to integrate even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree to their own trade agreements and external relations, which would effectively give the Kremlin power in an area connecting Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was incorporated into Russia five months ago, lies Russia's main fleet of Russia, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historic coastal sites.
The area between Rostov of Russia and Crimea also includes mines, factories and metal melters, which produce products vital to the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers – after new elections – consider constitutional changes to increase decision-making power in areas deviating from Ukraine’s core region on their own economies and languages.
But his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the Kremlin-Kemlin-Momarian-incidicted separatists, perhaps armed and incited.
Putin made his latest call for the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after rebels further advanced last week after Russian tanks and troops invade eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the beginning of a larger effort to take over a whole strategically significant coastal zone up to Crimea.
It has led to a massive strengthening of the town of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. With a population of half a million, Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko addressed European Union leaders in Brussels to apply for further action to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Union Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll be able to reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; leaders proposed to draw up further sanctions to introduce them if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in ambiguity.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisvik region after two Russian armored sections and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to confirm in trouble separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, journalists told reporters Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian troops encircled by Russia in Ilovaisk were replaced with 10 Russian skydivers who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opener was scored by Japanese rider Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first by Sufficker and a little later by Jeremy Menez from a penalty kick.
Lazio, too, got a rough shot after his narrowing goal in the closing moments of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez deflected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of Milan's former striker Inzagh, the San Siro stadium was only half full.
The crowd for the match was reported to be 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude photo scandal flutter
Geoffrey Edelsten has claimed to be outraged by hackers perhaps stolen nude photos of her fiancee and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
There has been a buzz in the entertainment world after a series of naked images from Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the Internet as a result of an extensive celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude footage of Hunger Games star Lawrence, as well as other superstars such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Melbourne-based Grecko have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who gave to Grecko last month, told Confidential newspaper, "this is sickening."
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private data can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as "smart" and saying the victims "feel themselves disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with his previous boyfriend, including two shots of Palmer topless at the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film features including "Love and Honor" with actor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovsky and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked photos yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ magazine, "there is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen was angered by a hacker in a tweet: "The publication of photos stolen from a cell is no different in any way from selling a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legitimate perspective alone.
Finland played almost like home soil and rallied to a sensational victory over Cuba at the volleyball World Cup.
See pictures of fan rush.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not a Polish red-and-white one but a Finn's blue-white.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2000 Finnish supporters at Spodek-arena.
I felt like playing on home soil.
That's how big an impact fans had on our game," Finland captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland were already 0-2 in the match, but rallied to win 3-2.
In the fourth set, Finland made a miracle climb from behind six points.
Cuba already led the period 16-10, but after that the Finns got a ecstasy.
A couple of hundred Finnish fans, however, were disappointed when an an airport, a charter plane could not land in Katowice due to a heavy fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the fight.
Finnish ballplay fans have conquered Europe at a rapid pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, more than 8000 Finland fans will be present at the Basketball World Cup.
It was as if every basket in Finland were a match-winning basket, USA star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's game.
