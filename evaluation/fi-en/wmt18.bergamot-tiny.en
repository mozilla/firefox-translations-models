Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, diagnosed as mental illness and now she makes art on the subject - 'You should have a right to their own body'
Dozens of patient stories hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts' Project room gallery.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
They decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell me my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By process, she refers to a gender reassignment process.
It is often a years-long period of research including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to "gender-identity disorder" diagnosis studies, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was very advanced in his own repair process anyway.
He felt he was a woman, but under Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process in order to correct gender legally.
The Trans Act, i.e. the Act on Confirmation of the Sex of Transcenition (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilise in order to get the right sex to, for example, population registry centres and passports.
At present, every gender-correcting one of their gender is required to be diagnosed with psychiatric diagnosis and proof of inability to reproduce.
A person has the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations of the law and the European Court of Human Rights is a precedent to oblige the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the leadership of the Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the True Finns entered into government.
Now the change in the law is stuck again.
It is a matter of domestic political disputes that are not even related to that law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland's division of Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two major installations.
One of them consists of packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, for example, any visitor can read the interpretation of a psychologist at Tampere University Hospital’s transpol from Auer.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and wrote an account based on these, which would define Auer's right to care and help.
The reality of the subject appears vulnerable to shaky.
The perception of the subject itself appears in a boundary-level way fragmented and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted gender reassignment.
Medical staff said his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
That's when February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked a transpol waiting lounge on television.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was born on television, in which Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can magnifying their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove your breasts," Auer tells me.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are different than the amount of your gender determined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender reassignment process is tougher for many people for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy people who are denied treatment in need of support and help, citing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many of those who have applied to the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
By virtue of these, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Disapplication to get treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's something that people tend to find hard to digest."
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started taking hormones, I felt relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed in childhood and teenage.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into your body and why the pectoral muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been to have people close to him who see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, sounding, and moving," he tells me.
Today, Auer already feels he's seen, he exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of loved ones may have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when loved ones are wrongsexed.
"They should know and know who I am, but they won't or be able to internalize it," he continues.
But not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without using hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of your gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And that's true.
In June 2014, for example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in terms of legal gender.
A full-age applicant makes a written application for a new personal identity number stating in it that they feel of another gender.
After a six-month cooling-off period, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry will provide the applicant with a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland, and Auer’s exhibition is also encapsulated in this demand.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil rights organization issues travel warning to Missouri
The national NAACP organization, which advocates civil rights for African Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouri. The reason is the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that took place there.
"NAACP's travel bulletin for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention to special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state of recent number of questionable racial events," the organization said in a statement.
The law, which recently came into force in Missouri, makes it difficult to export discrimination cases to court. In addition, the implementation of state laws is disproportionately directed at minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issue of a travel warning.
“Human civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped based on skin color and abused or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We have never heard of as many cases in a short time before."
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization's first warning to the United States.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri as well as the death of 28-year-old Black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel statement also referred to a Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be wary of their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by including money to pay bail or tell relatives they're going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth largest of the U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they approved immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this will increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and apply to other states. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (centre), who is responsible for State ownership steering, has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is inconsistent with the state's statement of will, according to the minister.
A supplementary pension of EUR 130,000 received by Vauramo was highlighted this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration of listed company directors.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it will give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company says the decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on corporate governance.
Sanctions immediately toughen up speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on its way from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met on the occasion of the G20 summit of industrialized countries in Hamburg, seemed to get along just fine.
Since then, the mood has cooled considerably.
There was a bitter response to the new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress in Russia last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
The most stunning response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said the sanctions law signed by Trump means a "full trade war."
Even if Russian reactions are only drawn to escalations and excesses in political rhetoric, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions law against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although Congress passed the law with considerable unanimousness, but for the president, the approval of the law was noticeably more difficult, according to then said.
In fact, Trump recently criticized the law he signed for "significant flawed."
President Trump's snub must have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting its own powers must also have been distasteful.
As is well known, there is an investigation into Russia’s possible involvement in the presidential election and the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As White House staff have changed frequently and various scandalous twists have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being pursued in the United States under the president's leadership but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia is a gimmicky relationship in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its Russia policy, the interests of member states are quite different.
For a member state with Russia such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly Fennovoima’s nuclear power plant project.
The use of sourness in Europe has been excluded from sanctions by the free liquor, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating disapproval in world politics.
But economic sanctions must be very well thought-out and precise.
Otherwise, they easily do more harm than good.
Is there nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has a statue of Liberty in its sights
Interfering to statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as everyone else: Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologues of the Trump administration, knew very well what was going on in a fierce debate with CNN's Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a verbal dispute over the president's proposal to substantially reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not exactly criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the statue of Liberty.
His attack was the significance of the statue, and especially the addition of a poem by Emma Lazarus from the statue in 1903, 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is what Miller said, “I don’t want to go into history any more of it now, but the Statue of Liberty is...a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The potion was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong, but it's not just history, as he said.
Lazarus’s touching words are Lazarus’s only kind where the state calls not only immigrants but “the poorest of the poor”: “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses year to breathe free, / The wret refuset of your teaming shore.”
The potion is more relevant now than ever.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism. He made it clear that the "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned to attach a poem to the statue's pedestal. They knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the links of French and American republicanism with a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, a female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deportees.
The inclusion of the poem in the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'ather and a devastating attack on the American nationalism idea.
Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthist who can now be considered some kind of sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, taking the U.S. flaring into a world of darkness: “Lady Liberty steps up.
He takes freedom of torch from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch doesn't show you the way to the United States.'
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of a pillar of freedom depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for a better life.
His pillar of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their torch does not lead the way, but incites the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to Great Britain national team
Neil Black, the results director of the UK Athletics Federation, says 16 Scots of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships in London, which begin on Friday.
According to Black, "there is something special happening in Scotland" from which Great Athletics attication must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long enough to understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I was centralising with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it would be related to the activities of the institute.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes it has to do with union action,
and the British Athletics Federation believes it is motivated by their actions.
And an ordinary streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s something great, whatever it is.”
Many Scots athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m. Eilidh Doyle, meanwhile, was chosen to captain the national team.
"Eilidh is unnecessarily modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly stunning," Black says.
"Athletes left the opportunity with pride in their achievements and heavily motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and train.
Eilidhi's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist of the Commonwealth Championships in the 400m hurdles, and these are his fifth world championships. He thinks it's "incredible" to have 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was set to seven in 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner, has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 meters in London. He also pays to watch for him: the man has an excellent season behind him, including victories in Great Britain's World Cup qualifiers and the Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championships, when the national team's only Scots was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain says he is "hugely proud" of having so many Scots involved, some of whom seriously compete for finals spots and medals.
"It's a great honour to be admitted to a clinic anyway, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who got to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize positions.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be insanely magnificent."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what there was bad publicity.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic policies, ranging from his political principles.
Criticism certainly annoyed,
He didn’t silence his critics.
"If speech freedom is removed, we may be led to foolish and silent as sheep to slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That's where we get to Larry Hogan, Maryland's governor, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. Citizens' Association sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff finds the challenge unjustified, and the attitude was dismissive online, too.
"What does it matter? “This is just Facebook,” a lot of people said.
But it matters,
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an astonishingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not a responsive to a hot-headed.
He has firmly led the state and stuck to principles.
He has also competently used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and posted a picture of a bald-saturated head in chemotherapy there.
That's why blocking users coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post. He said it was just a matter of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spams or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose. They were not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me their comments were respectful, considerate and matter-of-fact.
In his comment, the reverend quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question of hate crimes.
"I politely I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news stories," he wrote in a Washington Post news release.
"I also cannot accept that when more than one person comments on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organized force in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "medium-helmed attack." Someone else might call them to promote things that are considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it's really about the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on that was issued last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the government of Loudouni County violated the first increase in the U.S. Constitution in blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Alliance went to talks with Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-cost mailing fees had a similar impact to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and Washington was hammered by anonymous writers.
There were trolls even then.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers barking Washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, namely the U.S.-UK cooperation, trade and shipping agreement. This is according to documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the fundamental stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
Birds' summer feeding should be stopped immediately
There have been samples of about half a half of the places, plus online notifications of a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individual from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died from trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoaic protozoaic called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit doves, and of them, especially to pulsing.
In the 2000s, however, the disease began to be detected from peippolies.
In 2009, it was a good start.
That's when tricomonosis caused a big collapse in Finland's green finch stock, after which the species' strains have been receding.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of the Natural History Museum of the University of Helsinki.
There are fears that the last epidemic of green finches will be reoccurring if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field advantage for the next three days as Renaissance Club in East London hosts 25. A Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty of Northern Ireland led a tournament at neighbouring Archerfield Links last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new place and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will get to its full glory," says Rafferty.
"Players see the field at their best. It's in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's an avid ambassador for the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great showup for this airport.”
Eales, an Englishman, defends the title for the first time, despite winning both a European tour of both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a Southport-based player says.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: a tournament win was a wonderful thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.'
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil. He went on tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in a home region is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and playing pretty hard.
I am happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will include six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free. A car parking costs quip if there is only a driver in the car, and ten quid if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Potential indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade’s relay company, at least so far, the brigade said on Thursday.
Indoor air examinations continue.
The surveys began when a man who interrupted his military service for health purposes thought his health had weakened the barracks due to poor indoor air.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated incident and that other people who served in that unit have not had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this issue in a thorough manner.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that due to the July arrival batch, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have led to a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stale, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Golden Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove at cooking.
He rarely uses a boiler.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato – locally "nor" – straight into a fireplace.
Half an hour, a sweet potato burned to the crawl is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Dege's home has no furniture. He sits on a muddy painting, in which he usually also handles his daily chores, such as a murky cloudy water from a nearby squid with laundry.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and no fields have been assigned to him.
Multigamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. Military must also be considered.
"No one dare walk in village after 5pm tonight," Degei tells me.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village imprest leave was forced to vote in public in front of occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger into the Jakarta government, which holds the area under tight control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and Western Papuaa. The east of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enaroalal is a remote and bleak. The journey there begins on an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-threading five-hour drive on a rental car ride.
There is no public transport here.
With a town of about 19,000 people, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences whose wave tin roofs have been stained to yellow brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the god of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei tells me. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrapping headband, dark tweaking and bright blouse.
"Before, we just had magazines to cover our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province. Twenty-eight percent of its residents live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold.
Paniai is an upland area roughly the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Only about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced tune of tune of tune of tune of tune and Freeport.
Papua also has an estimated tune of tune of tune of 10,000 dollars.
For Papuans, however, these misery bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly buckling bucks for between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to buckling up to buckling.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 beapuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and raped thousands of them.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were given prominence of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful protests.
The report We Will Lose Everything of 2016 by the Archdioze of Brisbane has accounts of previous year's atrocities such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and relentless attacks towards peaceful protests.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases on a weekly basis," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million residents are Christian, but demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous Java, Borneo, Sumatran and Sulawes islands move to the region in hopes of better livelihoods.
Java warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Othermen have started selling chicken and vegetables in a market cheaper than locals," said Abeth You, 24, who is from Pania and moved to the province's capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to tackle Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 areas, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed at Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Pania had some kind of wave base just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The feared children told soldiers they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to accounts of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers seized the children and assaulted them, beating them with a rifle-nperating.
That's how one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma following an assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day it started to happen.
About 1,000 beans – young men and women, as well as children – gathered at a football pitch in front of a local police station and an army command centre to demand justice.
They were carrying hunting springs for celebrations, and they began performing the traditional waita dance of Papuan Mee Pago, which dances in a ring and imitates a bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and army buildings.
When the mood got hotter, soldiers were ordered in an internal radio system: "If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been made public to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident director of the Kego Koto area, foresaw the situation snaging out of control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen to me anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on a left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house painted brightly colored.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers.
"A number of shots were fired in the vendace."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was indeed him," Yohanes told TIME magazine with sadness. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw he died... I kissed him.”
Papua Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that officers were simply "protecting" a police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“That’s when it comes to life and death.”
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that Papua's violence would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that the same thing never happens again."
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
But he immediately began to take his speeches.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but you need certain processes to do that," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start investigating Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." The crimes relate to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME newspaper that 11 cases of Papua’s human rights violations have already been investigated, including the events of Paniai.
The families of Paniai's victims are gloomy incredulousness to the allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
“I’m tired of this.”
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the incident.
“I’m afraid,” he said.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me. I'm afraid I'll be shot.'
His brother Yacobus confirms that paniniers are afraid to discuss the event.
He said he had been assaulted by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after burial to the victims," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Pania's neighbouring area of Deiya.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of a construction company, which originated when the manager refused to take the man who lost consciousness to a hospital. Children were also among the injured.
The man who needed hospital treatment was Ravianus Douw, 24, who had been stranded in water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers rocked police officers responding with warning shots.
But locals said a moving police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire toward the crowd, killing one villager.
“We are terrified. We fear revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near a hospital and saw wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiya's parliament has called on officers who fired shots to account and withdraw a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem with the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent in the Mee, Moni-, Dani and Damal tribes living in the green middle highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of beans with random attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM's executives are Panias, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The military has responded to rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "refucking of national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sadly, forgotten place."
Poverty fuels discontent.
There are few rice for sale in Enarotal, and that's too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Croping is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go to more educated and wealthy migrants better than locals.
Few beans have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in town because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Pania Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is under-recognized worldwide.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, despite being granted a rare filming permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The editors reporting on the troubled easternmost provinces of the troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua have new risks: refusing a visa and being blacklisted," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of action by the press means that only Papua's immediate neighbours are being pressured by the Indonesian government.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “numbered and widespread violations”, including the Pania shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported Papua's liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so masking the evidence of human rights violations would be tricky."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia has a 2019 presidential election, but beans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are embroiled in the Pania shooting scene," said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Yokohow to know the situation of panicked people: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army of wanting and poverty, virtually without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the paniniers, like other beans, consider the votes they given to Jokowie as a "debt" to be repaid.
“They don’t want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, relatives of Pania's shooting scene victims once more showed resistance metaphorically: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite a police station and army office.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with head drooping.
“What else can we do?”
Dereck Chisora calls for Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall arena.
But the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora rolls over the reason for flopping a replay game entirely to Helenius's shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable," Chisora blunts.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time at a full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial points verdict.
The rematch ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told the Evening News in May that the match has been postponed until the autumn.
There has been no new match since.
But the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
After all, the fight would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora fell ill anyway.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up to severe pain.
My heart was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on, Chisora tells me.
The Briton says he is currently in about 45 percent shape.
By all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in his sights is Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December with split votes.
Fire takes Torch skyscraper in Dubai for second time
The flames captured one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee a 737-foot-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire within two years of a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured. There was no indication of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to a fire alarm sound and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue officials said firefighting forces were able to extinguish the fire at 4 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government said it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident can raise questions about the safety of materials used at the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
The board of the Torch building commissioned an investigation following a 2015 fire to find that plates used to cloak a facade cladding and insulation.
In the UK, police believe insulation and cladding plates at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid propagation of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9pm on Tuesday and 5am on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara from Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour, and the registration is 27-REV.
The moped was found later Thursday.

In the U.S., more than 20 percent of air travelers take banned items on board, survey reveals survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the U.S. had deliberately taken banned items to planes past the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other items with blades that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1 percent said they only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey, carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy rules than others.
19.7 percent of passengers who deliberately violated TSA rules were Gen Y representatives and less than 15 percent were part of Generation X.
The rules were most commonly broken by taking food and liquids to a plane.
More than three percent admitted to deliberately taking items with blades to a plane. In addition, 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs on a plane.
Passengers from across the United States attended the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had taken smuggling goods by accidentally past security checks and how many had made such knowingly.
It is not surprising that most travelers also take the most likely to pass security security – consciously or unknowingly.
But as the surveyed company notes, TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what liquids to take to a plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seized people are liquids.
For a while, there was also a suspicion that books should not be taken to a plane.
Liquids may be taken to domestic flights, but not for international flights.
US Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reverses decision to delay Obama's term decisions to cut emissions
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA,, bydnoring his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions during Obama's term of administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he runs takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers more than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the action brought against his previous decision by a federal appeals court.
States should start complying with the 2015 target ozone standards of land levels as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move the implementation of decisions forward by a year to give his agency more time to familiarise himself with the plan because the agency "doesn't want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was an Oklahoma State public prosecutor, before President Donald Trump appointed him EPA director. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his entry to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed to chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to relax regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA executive exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's ruling on oil and gas companies. The decision required companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his turnaround in relation to ozone regulations only reinforces EPA cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on a schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue for agreement on schedules," Pruitt said. In his previous post, he sued the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers granted to us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt can continue to use "therefore its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, a New York state public prosecutor who led a state consortium to sued by the EPA this week, said the group plans to continue to exert pressure.
"The EPA's mind change as a result of our actions is a significant victory for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical factories, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog thus created can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people. That's also a factor in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required for a guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration, as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interesting groups."
Super car manufacturer becomes an SUV - 'to happen in Ferrari's style'
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to stick to its exclusive position.
That's likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style," chief executive Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of measles of Eastern Savo of the same virus type
The Rantasalmi measles infection is the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern Savo, THL informs.
The National Institute for Health and Welfare's virology laboratory has confirmed on Thursday that Eastern Savo's fifth measles infection is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed by a person in the coastal salmelity on Friday 28 July is of the same type of virus as previous cases of Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections recorded in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles recorded in the region in June.
The news is good, as it means we haven't seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur after the fifth sufferer to come to the event until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over yet,” says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, doctor in charge of infectious diseases at Soster.
There have been no new measles infections or suspicions of any further caasing since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is also important that everyone takes care of the up-to-date vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.
Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a licensed squealing act
Pontika's soup wasn't even considered legalized.
In the background, the underlying reason is that the process produces methanol, along with liquor, which is toxic.
Making a sprint at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
Scream is made by fermentation, with a bounce of a pot of heat.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, along with liquor, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make a pony soup for an everyman’s right, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health comments.
When the ministry was preparing an amendment to the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the pontika was not considered legalized.
It was not brought to a political table either.
There was no discussion about the release of distillery, says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä.
He is a negotiating team of parliamentary groups of government parties who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
You can't even promise to distil the pontika at home on application in the future.
Commercial manufacturing also remains subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that home cooking of alcoholic beverages comes into a simple rule: alcohol can be made by fermentation at home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally do a scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify regulations.
The new law removes the requirements of flavouring and flavouring substances and enables the preparation of squeams, Mäkelä specifies.
Manufacturing must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, you can prepare as many drinks as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not to be sold.
Screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
Seventy-five per cent of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Bill is now being reviewed by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will be referred to Parliament as soon as the autumn period begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital over suspicions of heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his jail sentence at Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital escorted by armed guards this morning.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he was discharged from hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed Pistorius was taken to hospital for examinations.
A spokesman for Pistorius' family, meanwhile, said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Litered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and heads of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peshaw to end his public speech that he will not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president was upset by Nieto for banning the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the U.S. southern border at Mexico's expense.
The Washington Post also released a flint of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. There was a tense exchange of words during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement to take refugees to Australia is "ridiculous," "sense" and "stupid." Trump said an agreement negotiated under Obama would make him look like "idiots" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call of an entire day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-established racist lynching in search of justice
A Ford Mercury brand car overtakes a crowd in Monroe's small town of Georgia in rural Georgia and continues its journey toward a small windshield of the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men block the road before the car gets to the bridge.
A middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath of his cigar and snaps through a windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man snoughts.
"Out of the car!"
Screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-up of a re-lapping airing on 22 July 2017.
But shock is genuine when a noose thread is threaded around the neck of "Roger."
Human rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge since 2005 to re-establish events of 1946. At that time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live with us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with re-launch arrangements.
"It's a shameless stale of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, re-lapping is a startling call to action. It also reminds people of Monroe that the injustice has never been fixed.
"We want those responsible to go to trial. We want things to finally come to a close, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice."
A coroner covers the body of a victim killed in a Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of lynched from Monroe and surrounding counties.
No one was charged with murder.
While the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynch have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people from the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by a ruling from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in April, and elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election in which Roger Malcom, a black tenant farmer, stabbed Caucasian landowner Barnett Hester in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothsy.
Brooks said the town rumored Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with a child.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom buckling nil buckling for buckling.
On the way home was accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. Authorities were involved in the murders and disposing of evidence and did not reveal the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a vote-of-voucher," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal to blacks that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-launch of the Georgian massacre for nearly a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of shocking racism that many people would like to believe has disappeared from today's United States.
The show is hard to watch, but it's even harder to look at what Greene says is intended.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Training for this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – about a dozen blacks and two dozen whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing a local Ku Klux Klan leader in re-lap for years, but the role is always just as difficult and obnoxious.
"I'm going to feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh tells me.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is raised so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practiced their lines.
The performance begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushed Hester. He's furious that Hester has been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear that? I said get out of my land, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, replies.
Then there's a batting.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
“Did I find too fast by accident?” he asks.
"No," Greene's snuck.
"I just don't think white people used the word n---u at the time."
"So," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version.”
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is overrun by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the show. They want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene begins all over.
Now Rascona's words are slamming.
No one laughs.
Re-up to a quick and violent end.
Screaming, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands by bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken by every second word.
A few dozen spectators wipe out some 50 spectators wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half are Caucasian.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show of Ithaca in New York State, but most of them are locals.
They have visited Brooks' guidance to the graves of victims in the oppressive moisture of Georgia.
Murders have become reality from the story. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After a singing performance, Greene invites a crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutes like to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Greene will thank the public.
The actors who played the lyrics take off their capes and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman involved in the show comforts me.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, audiences and actors gather for a dinner together.
A white couple who arrived from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinskin finds it hard to find words when she describes the sensations aroused by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and look at horrible actions that they say and do people who look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"I've been to see that lynches are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
"Re-up exercise is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Banking vegetables in stores stirs up: This much by removing 'extra parts' actually saves you
Is it allowed to remove cauliflower leaves in the store before weighing?
And taking out a big hat from pineapple - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers divide opinions strongly: to one, it is an indication of the extreme tussle, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which nevertheless go to bins at home.
This phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, the vegetable department of Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki has cardboard boxes, because many people tear out the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to trade biowaste.
According to a news release published by Taloussanomat, snooze at a vegetable counter amazes traders.
But how much to remove excess parts of vegetables before weighing actually save money?
How important is it really a snub?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take leaves or strains out of pineapple, top artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros, when it peels all leaves.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to €1.95 when its stock was twisted out.
Latva artichokes: 2.40 euros was €2.40 when the short population cut off.
Delicate mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain of 80 cents.
The end result: If leaves and strains go plucked, at best a few tens of cents will save one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona as brass star signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that representatives of Neymar had paid a buy-out price of 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish league.
The staggering €222m transfer is the biggest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United paid 105 million euros from Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league put the brakes on the move earlier Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempt at Neymar's representatives.
Under league rules, a buying club cannot pay a buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out their contracts themselves, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a potentially new home crowd in PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa investigates details
In a further announcement, Barcelona said it would provide information on the payment to European football's governing body Uefa to determine any disciplinary action in the case.
Spanish league president Javier Tebas, among others, has suspected PSG of breaking Uefa's financially fair play rules by his use of money.
Uefa can punish a club that will make a loss of more than 30 million euros over three years.
Uefa says Neymar's move does not automatically break its economic clauses.
Neymar's move to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
PSG, for example, may sell several players with substantial amounts, Uefa was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, sustained heavy burns from lightning strike - flare caught on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work activities on a plane at Ltung Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a lightning plane struck a plane from the rainy sky.
The force of the lightning threw the plane to Dunn, near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said his brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I asked if he was alive," Austin's sister, Autumn, said.
Austin spent two weeks in hospital.
In addition to burn injuries, he suffered muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Autumn tells me.
An airport representative said the salamarisk's warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividend
On Friday, British training group Pearson announced it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut a dividend of 72 percent when it started a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already cut 4,000 jobs in connection with previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson said it would cut costs again by tune of EK 300 million in May as part of his third austerity program aimed at revitalising a business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his stake in the Penguin Random House publishing house to his partner, Bertelsmann. The company said it would keep its outlook for the year unchanged. Its revenue increased by one per cent in the first half of the year to LVL 2.05 billion.
Strike on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Officials said a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others wounded.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagth Kabul.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army was subjected to an attack by a self-made explosive device "carrying by a person."
The statement said the condition of all injured persons was stable and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say Taliban's strengthening and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns to NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area of predominantly Shia Muslims.
The Taliban declared itself to be behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the country's deadliest militant faction attack after U.S.-led forces overthrow Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights Afghanistan's unstable situation as President Donald Trump considers whether the U.S. will send more troops to the country to help local army and police.
Correspondents say suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly reduced people's confidence in the government, its policies, and President Ashraf Ghan in particular.
EPA reverses decision to delay implementation of smog provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to enforce decisions to reduce smog emissions during Obama's administration term a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone specifications" of 2015 late Wednesday. The agency said the decision was indicative of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," head Scott Pruitt said in an agency statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone specifications for one year until October 2018. According to specifications, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia. They said delaying implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to relax Barack Obama's early environmental regulations. Trump said the measures are part of a broader economic growth-oriented agenda.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health impact of rising emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
A member of the senior ISIS figures, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicions were to be taken to board a plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security capture.
Police would not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device dissing toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example on public transport.
Michael Phelan, the Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, says the terrorists' plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were taken into custody over suspected terrorist plans in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings will also continue.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to President and CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels, and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete our strategic investments announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible fight in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the nearest boxing match of the near future of the under 66.7-pound series, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's unbeaten lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's senior featherweight champion.
Garcia beat former four-weight world weighting champion Adrien Broner on Saturday with a unanimous decision. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five on a list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia reached out his right hand and asked, "How are you, Master?
Good luck to the match!"
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on seven on Saturday.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that a match between the men would be "complete in terms of size."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the series [33.5 pounds] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small 63.5 pound.
I want to get back to lightweight.
He must go up to the lightweight series [61.2 pounds]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes.'
Holidaychenko agreed.
" Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will debut in a lightweight series later this year and will fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight series at the Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on a pay-per-view channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later stating that he was ready to fight on a channel offering the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get to an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "uninfident fighter" and perhaps intend to go see Saturday's fight.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's profusely boasting and said that this three-weight master from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the impact force and then boxing.
The men said they felt they want the match between them to happen more and more strongly.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight against the best. “Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match.'
Average salary of €5,300, education whatever happens - investment advice situation was 'wild and free'
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisers spoke about a full nonsusting investment product when selling.
Rules on investment advisers and various sales of investment products will tighten early next year.
The tightenings are based on the new MiFID directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service perform its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications to APV Investment Degrees Ltd, whose degree working group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are drawn up by Aalto University Executive Education Oy, a provider of management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "comprehensive about requirements."
The study materials of the degrees include 10 to 15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70 percent.
Of the staff of the largest banks, approximately all investment service providers have completed either an APV1 or APV2 degree, as they are compulsory under the companies’ own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose staff seem to have shunning the completion of degrees, Savikko says.
He said there are "a few banker shops like this."
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14 000 people since 2000 and approximately 3,000 more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisers.
Some bankers consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
More other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Services Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because then the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros in an average of one month, including commissions, fringing benefits and performance-based bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly paid employees are approximately EUR 5,300.
Men who work at tasks earn an average of more than EUR 5,900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4,500.
The average tenth of those earning the most earners earns about 8,100 euros.
The tenth of men earning the highest earners earn more than 9,000 euros a month or more, a tenth of the highest-earning women earning €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
There has hitherto been trusted in self-regulation at employee level and duties.
According to Fiva, the audit it conducted included individual cases where the investment adviser’s professionalism and competence were not sufficient based on the advice.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if professionalism and qualifications are at a smooth level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
More other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new MiFID II directive.
It requires each undertaking to be responsible for providing investment services to be adequately skilled.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, for its part, will be empowered to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, the market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current current is a legal requirement for investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and tied agents to sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably be empowered to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided during the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and continuing training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has a duty to show that this has also been done.
The court specifies that in practice, for example, the company must map staff job descriptions at individual level.
There will certainly be different requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced within the deadline, if the competence or experience is not at an adequate level.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets a certain time of criteria.
According to the court, with the change, the rules will tighten and concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane 'drawn' giant plane on top of US
The plane's flying route was drawn over the U.S. on Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner aircraft to test the durability of Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane from Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 kilometres in an 18-hour and 1 minute, longer than any permanent commercial scheduled in-service commercial scheduled in the world.
The flight stayed within U.S. borders throughout the journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra persistent beach swimming school students are not refractory by rain or sun toast - Iines Kaikkonen relucked with the help of a swimming crowd
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers are not a mock, praises Taina Itkonen, who runs swimming schools.
A total of 13 children will accumulate swimming skills in this week's swimming schools, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that school and eskari are already starting, Itkonen estimates.
Imatra beach swimming school is organised by the Sports Uniting project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the lynx beach.
The sun was shining and young swimming school students were training to stay on the surface with swimming blocks, some without already.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines Kaikkonen, 5, was initially dubious about going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to pedal towards the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he went to a lot of swimming this summer.
He thinks the slurry beach is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with swimming berry village.
You too will be happy with today’s achievements, the swimming fast boasted.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to fight water war sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who followed the swimming pool of her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, sees a beach swimming pool as a good start to learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school students packed on a pier.
The boys had enough to do with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, nailed fruits and basked for the day.
In water, teaching continued, but there was no hurry to the pier.
It's not like summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a connecting story"
You see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, which manufactures cleaning products, launched a series of Unknown Soldiers products a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks - as well as "wc brush with a border brush."
An unknown soldier refers to a film premiered in these autumn and the marketing of a movie.
Still, there's something special about the combination, and the products have been slandered on social media: When do Unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Sniproduct Executive Vice President Aino Määttä say?
We are a film partner.
We support this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
He says the products will be put to special protection, and the film will thus get visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, this is a common story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products,” Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen an old Unknown Soldier.
Cleaning is not alien to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall’s vichys, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela have been introduced to the market.
Unknown products were already being gutted by Finnish Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time to premiere, so there is still a follow-up.
Valio, Refiner, Neste and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet revealed their war products of the unknown’s partners.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers age tests announced
The latest results of Swedish asylum seekers' medical age tests have been announced. The results of tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80 % of the tested were defined as over 18 years of age. But not everyone thinks the tests are reliable.
Sweden's National Forensic Law Agent agency began testing earlier this year.
Tests can be used to assess the age of asylum seekers more accurately than before. A new test was introduced after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failing to determine the true age of applicants claiming to minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
80% of the tested, i.e. an asylum seeker in 2002, were determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, the Forensic Science Agency determined in 25 cases that the test subject was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the end result of an asylum seeker being "possibly under 18."
Tests were carried out only in cases of reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Fortension Bureau says the results are consistent with previous monthly results.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences to the statistics of previous months," he told The Local newspaper.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean applicants have lied to their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "referencings to be examined at being 18 years of age or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used for tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic resonance imaging of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the doubters is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinc Institute, whose work includes assessing human biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has been interrupted earlier than usual or later.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told Metro newspaper.
But Göransson, the forensic agency, excused the accuracy of tests: "You can generally say you're at risk of determining a child to adulthood is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test person will soon be 18 years old. The risk is about 10%.”
Ilonen collapses 30 places in Scotland
The five-over par result in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 notches downwards with a track of results in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left for a given 11th place on Saturday, but was found to share 41st at the end of the round.
Ilonen had a three-nation double bog following three bots in difficult weather.
Others had a hard time, too.
Englishman Ian Poulter stepped up to share the top spot in a one-under-par round, despite telling me that there were enough jobs to hold an umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I hung along and finally it was a good day, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor Changes Party
Jim Justice, the Democratic Gov. of West Virginia, announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he would change parties.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... Today I tell West Virginia I can't help you as a Democrat governor anymore."
The audience erupted into raucous applause.
"Tomorrow, become a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised a significant announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected Governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about buckling buckling.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying "the change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather build barriers than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party with no leadership whatsoever and unable to find a positive, human-connecting message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightnings sown damage - Thursday is even becoming the toughest day of the summer thunder
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
During the past week, thunderstorms have been thunderstorms, especially in central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes sparked several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday could be the toughest thundery day of the summer to date.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been lightning, especially in central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
In Pöytyä, lightning struck a terraced electrical hut at a terraced house, causing a small fire.
Emergency services received a report of a fire about a quarter to midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in a sauna space at the end of a terraced house.
Emergency services dismantled the roof and wall to find fire hotspots and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning sparked an outbuilding into flames on Harjulantie before midnight.
By the time emergency services arrived, the building was at a full stage of the fire, and all the emergency services could do was prevent the fire from spreading.
A outbuilding of about fifty square metres was burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
The occupants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flamboyant lightning strike.
Emergency services attended to check the incident, but this time lightning did not produce a fire - only a few fuses pounced.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
News of the failure was received between 8 and 9am on Thursday morning, after which trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to resume normally on a thunderstorm-raised section of a thunderstorm.
Lightning has dictated havoc across Finland.
But lightning has been comparatively limited this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely deady! estimates Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning flash of summer, it even feels strong for many.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but it has been like this summer’s thunders, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, ground flashes blinked 1,700 times, with potential for even the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer in Thursday: by about 4pm, there were 1,790 land lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning process continues in the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning strike rate had risen to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something to catch to do to prevent this year from breaking the "record" of two years ago.
But you can expect a thunderstorm to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the end of the week, which is a birth environment suitable for thunderstorms.
The thunderstorms' main focus is likely to move south from the north of the country to the south for Saturday, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform rain front is in store for central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, thunderstorms only sparsely.
Coe praises Russia's 'open' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world athletics boss, praised what he described as a vague apology, which Russia made over a doping scandal on Thursday. But Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian Athletics Director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that the ban on Russia received is appropriate and that he will fight decisively against doping.
He said he regrets "for all the athletes who were awarded a gold or silver medal in competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded motion," IAAF chairman Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything it could to reorganize its operations."
Coe said he was also "satisfactory" for Russia to accept the terms of the ban to close.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the right time to end Russia's ban," Coe said.
"We will have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been to keep clean athletes separate from corrupted systems," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status at the World Athletics Championships in London, which begins on Friday. They have met the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still needed to meet many requirements before its status could be restored.
"The testing remains inadequate, and the coaches with an operating ban still operate freely," he told reporters Friday to the IAAF Council following a proposal in London.
Production company disappointed with the weak success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not have the success of the authors, Yle reports.
If honestly, I am disappointed, admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, who produced the film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached just over 100,000 viewers, compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
There was no lottery, but it's important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have had their money by now.
Now we have to wait for small bites of foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
European football clubs' spending limits the spending limits the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain. This is football's most expensive player transfer ever.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in a prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair-play financial rules. They say PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros to end the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary at new club is going to be in tens of millions of dollars.
There are a wide range of economic aspects to the transfer of Neymar to France.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer amount and attach him to his star guard, as the club is funded by a Qatari oil-rich dynasty of rulers.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on player acquisition, but they need to be balanced by real sources of revenue so that football-related business is not loss-making.
Fair-game financial rules were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platini of France, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners with their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair-play financial rules shifted from debts to monitoring losses by clubs.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model, which first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003, became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of players on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of Fair Play Financial Rules will last until 2018. During that period, clubs may make a loss of up to 30 million euros.
Although Platini was forced to step down as UEFA president in scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of the game are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, in charge of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid out Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it can amortise the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair play financial rules, the first sanctions were issued in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60m, which was later reduced to 20 million euros. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of a standard 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies related to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual results.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari tourism authority's support for PSG was oversized.
It has also come to light that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG might be funded by payments from the Qatar 2022 football World Cup organizing commission.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymars be made into an ambassador for the World Championships. It would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is even following more closely than usual companies to circumvent the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG to move Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and boost sales of club products and jerhous.
The club estimates that its turnover will grow by at least 30 percent under the Neymar deal.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the world's best player, tried to make it harder for Neymar to move. It was alleged to break the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told a Spanish newspaper AS. By state, he referred to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the work of a football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports moose.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair-game financial rules. There are so many interests associated with the famous player representing the state."
Now there's a rush: Finland's World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though she should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach’s advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow and Mäkelä in a triple jump qualifier on Saturday.
But Ghazaryan, the Armenian coach, has not been allowed to get a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in a UK major broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from World Cup organizers to serve as a document, but even that is not good enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first Brexit symptoms, or what," coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa issues himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Athletics Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't make such a big difference.
As long as someone looks to the point of step marks at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of the possible omission of his coach.
World Cup medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championships begin in London today on Friday and last just over a week to finish on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports to which Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
There are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one rank to another, where by gaining experience, you will mature an athlete's performance to a level where an adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now Finland’s small World Cup team does not have such young athletes, but not even old-timers.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It pulls bench athletes to a television screen and glue to watch the Games, even though London medals are not decided until late at night due to the time difference.
From the 2015 World Athletics Championships, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The daredeviorals are waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the latter are told by his recent results by him and other throwers, as well as the long hill to be left in the qualifiers last summer.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes at the Games, getting to the final competition or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be given by a good success in the international youth competitions this summer.
The processing of young talents and supporting its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from coaching as well as bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as the culminations of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, rather than because of deterrents of terrorism or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copperin's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Enni Rukajärvi, a snowboarder, has finished second in a big air race in Colorado, USA.
Second place at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried to hit the caballerial 1080 on his last jump at the Games for the first time, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and it’s good right now, but I’m sorry that the last jump didn’t go quite.
I will try again in the competition, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air of snowboarding, a contestant jumps for the sport.
Viking Line’s new express ship stays in Helsinki
The new express vessel FSTR of shipping company Viking is running too late.
The fast-track ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
Loading was undergoing loading around eight o'clock.
The ship was late in Helsinki.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half to get on board.
Now the queue of cars is moving slightly," Johannes Rebane of Estonia, who is waiting to get a ship in the Port of Helsinki, told me at 7.30pm.
Rebane thought there had been a technical fault with the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting to enter the ship in their cars.
Christa Grönlund, Communications Manager at Viking, tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for Tallinn’s return journey for a couple of hours.
The ship was to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8.15pm.

Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously hankers for characters' glory days of the '80s and the '90s grung (at those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars of the series moved to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscing that we've stuck in the Facebook era in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like a lifetime of its time.
First Day of Camp performed surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (including H. The backstory of a vegetable can of a man Benjamin speaking in the voice).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching adults. The emphasis on that makes it a joke to the impossible of reaching the past.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it is parodying, for example, 90s stalkers, such as the horror film The Hand Who Cheaps of Chearts.
In one passage, one of the characters digs out an Apple Powerbook, inline roll skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot features Ronald Reagan (as a Michael Showalter) accomplice George H. W. Bush (actored by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best thing is side paths.
It's especially fun to see Paul Rudd, who has a bearded bendout under the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the film Singles. Andy, played by Rudd, the king of camp, is getting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may put this series flying as a kind of recurring Seven Up! series until it comes to its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Year Laters. In its final scene, a band of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's 'Comrade Detective, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans series of Cold War, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW Series wrestling imagery, where East meets the West.
The comedy series is created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest pair of cops fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The starring tough-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefina include Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the cops spend time watching chess on TV in the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo-Sevigny. You get a fun game of their spotting.
But Comrade Detective gets caught up too much to imitate a clumsy socialist drama – including a killer hidden behind the Reagan mask, for example. That's why the show often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the show is not fast enough and not plentiful.
In summary, the series might act better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby bingeing burgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the show weren't wrong: we fell to numbing our own recent history and their history, too.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru takes to the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru is facing a hard bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and a world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting older than me.
It's a funny thing," the 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
Kouvolalainen was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made on a quick schedule to China's autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has never faced anything like that before.
This was the first time my fight was called off.
It annoyed me, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
But the fighter is pleased that a new date was made for the struggle.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect fitness, as it will not improve in a week.
Fitness can get worse if you exercise too much now.
In his previous few struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in vertically.
This time it's different.
Issaa Kouvola describes a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come on hard in the first round and try to take him to the mat.
He's won the jujutsu World Cup, so he knows how to wrestle.
Kouvolalainen’s previous match did not go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru to his eyebrow, and victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get any hits.
When I set out to knock down, he hit my eye.
It upset me for a long time.
New motivation
Some freebies fight once a year, some rise more frequently in the ring.
The next opponent Issa, for example, fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
We are now facing the second struggle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten heavy.
I have been training and in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good training when there was one guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, as the Kouvola native on Saturday will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting in a standing is the 32-year-old's main tactics.
You have to hit sensibly.
If there is an opportunity, I will go to the land myself.
You can't give nuances for free, as they consume the most.
Macau is tempting Tauru, who fought in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been vigorous and inflation relenting has stopped speculation about rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow. The bank shifted interest rate hikes because there is even more pressure on family income levels.
By a vote of 6 to 2, decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Commission decided to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent. The rate hike received even less support this month because of the imperity of economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that there was even more pressure on household income levels because inflation is expected to accelerate further close to three per cent in the autumn.
But the bank said rate hikes will be needed in the next few years to curb inflation boosted by Brexit. In addition, the bank indicated that loan costs could be increased more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw some of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide favourable funding to banks through the program at quid quid quid quid quid, at a total of €15 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecast by the Commission for Monetary Policy, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the next few years as a decline in real household income reduces consumption."
As for interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need to curb "some degree of monetary policy tightening" market expectations "slightly wider."
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increases are "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8 percent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened 0.5 percent to norn. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged after weaker-than-expected growth rates dampened by increased expectations of interest rate hikes. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and scarce wage increases. The bank says it will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income from falling in revenues in the next few years. However, it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a sharp increase in demand for British products as a result of weak pounds. It refutes part of the impact of a decrease in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25 percent after a shocked EU referendum result, which plunged the pound to a fall.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is unlikely to show up in prices and the economy until four years from now.
Before the central bank's latest decision, interest rate hikes had begun to be demanded more louder as inflation tightened pressure on households. Three policymakers called for a 0.5 percent rate hike in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6 percent last month from 2.9% in June. But the bank said it was expected and inflation would tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said its two percent target level was due to "total" low pound.
"Given the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to tighten further as lenders feverishly seek customers and want to close a year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal contracts are more popular, interest rates are low and there are also no costless options."
NHS to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients may be prescribed an "transverse" anti-HIV prophylaxis. In the Supreme Court, a dispute over funding of a medicine under the English Public Health Care System (NHS) was concluded.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A pre-titling drug has been found to reduce the risk of transmission by approximately 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's judgment last year. It says the NHS will be able to pay for the drug PrEP, even if it claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS of England, called the decision announced Thursday a "significant new intervention," and the national AIDS organization described it as "a decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to start taking entrants to an experiment to expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be given to anti-contact anti-HIV therapy, which reduces the risk of transmission.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A drug to be taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take the drug every day or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants for men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their illness.
People living in England and registered for general practitioner treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs bang quip 10,000, and the English NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"That is yet another significant achievement in the battle that has been going on for more than 30 years to tackle one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP medication is targeted correctly to those in need and belonging to high-risk groups, it could have a epochal effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those in high-risk groups will receive a drug funded by the NHS funded by the NHS, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to consult with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a very many people.
This was welcome news.”
"Now is the most important thing to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk is excluded from it," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The drug PrEP used for trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that prolonged in vain for several months due to government slowing down," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have an epochal effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important to launch the experiment as soon as possible across the country. This will allow us to protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted."
Quality of life: midlayer and smart interior design solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was excited about renovating properties, moved from a Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house. The success of the renovation is evidenced by the fact that Joanne hasn't packed his stuff yet and changed.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne tells me.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to a housing show here and found that rooms were as tall as in my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day.'
Since then, the 90-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where you could only get into the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate layer to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
That was my demands," he says.
He hired an employment at the Duck & Shed design firm in Notting Hill, an Erfan Azad. Erfan was given the task of drawing on the space of rooms nearly four metres high and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales target, but a home.
The room height wasn't quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that you don't have to churn in them.
The structures had to be modified to ensure that the height is just right on and under them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms in the space with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, Retrouvius' copper-crossed window opens into a stylish lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a distinctive style.
Using mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both end of a short corridor make the corridor seem longer than real.
A mirror in an in-room kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the glossiness is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with a folding door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne’s kitchen, it is unique to lift the door up in the same way as a garage door.
"It took a bit of design," Erfan tells me about a steel-reinforced veneer-coated MDF door.
"It's balanced, meaning it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With the design of a reasonable space and storage space, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, another bedroom and an even better layout.
“As the apartment sells, the area determines – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the case of a background, a real estate agent walks into a home and calculates the price based on the acreage."
In Jonne’s apartment, the area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The outfit is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional attachment to the apartment is created partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to electrical wires running on walls.
They are important, but not the same.”
Jonne’s apartment is an example of good planning and additional square meters of making a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It may also happen that you don’t want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia's outfit choice hit a button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Bzhstad for the last time before giving birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate pale blue dress.
Sofia represented a smile at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Bzhstad, Sweden, this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-tight outfit that gorgeously dressed a pregnant princess at the last.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation event Sofia will represent before she gives birth.
His due date is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue put on a fine princess.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Bzhstad, Sweden, this week.
Sofia completed her outfit with a kit.
Sofia was just embodied in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got into talking to photographers at the event.
Now I just hold my stomach," Sofia said, pointing to her end pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chilis
In the summer of 1996, a stall was launched at Lahti market selling Thai food.
The Bayers did not dare to taste, they walked by.
In the stall, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances of Panja.
He had little Finnish, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at that time.
Because people didn't dare go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught Lahtins to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Try to taste, he said.
I got hooked on a flat.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen at Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were fewer than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and places limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at a plate with a dictionary learning from Thai.
Two years went by on the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to move because I was told the self-made spice pastes smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the market hall.
There's room in there.
Now we jugglers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times, we have to say hilariously to ask guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows his customers.
He's told me what he's been going on and who we've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customers' life varies and the food society changes.
He remembers what name to eat my first spring rolls with a man.
He remembers me as skinny and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and exchange news with the Pegger.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chilli sauce.
He has opened our thoughts and hearts in addition to our tastes.
Today, many people speak to him Thai - thanks to increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Although he's been having a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's hard working.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the completion of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
Discovery of underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists willing to strike in Europe
Early this year, security officials got their hands on a significant list of anti-terrorism work.
The list includes data from more than 170 ISIS fighters ready to invade Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also images of each.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The Evening News reported on the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been clarified.
The newspaper said Iraqi army special forces found a list of terrorist IDs and images containing terrorists while investigating an underground base of a terrorist organization in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person’s home country.
The list also includes terrorist specialities.
For example, Sami J., a German 27-year-old on the list, the port name, Abu Assid al-Almani, is known as the German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written to be a specialty alongside his picture.
There is no further details on the man's fate.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have gone to ISIS from Europe, for which the fate of them is uncertain.
Man sinks below surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the emergency services, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
A bucket of utterers can save a drowning life.
A person under water was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
An emergency services diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
Emergency services received a report after 4:30 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man in his mid-50s.
According to interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estlander commends cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Those present also gave excellent guidance to divers.
Things were over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with Border Patrol and police.
Two passenger cars collide in Eura; nine people in cars, three seriously injured
A total of nine people were in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, according to the fire marshal on duty.
Both men and women are among the injured.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads around 4 p.m.
The crash happened when another car flipped from behind a warning triangle in front of another car, according to the fire chief on duty.
Emergency services say there is a speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour at the intersection.
Brothers fight for more than buck 50,000 million real estate assets
Two brothers argue over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than bucks. The dispute relates to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, former Carlton football club president and real estate developer, lives in the Toorak value zone just three houses from his younger brother, Paul. The younger brother has taken a dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the breakup.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, jointly own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded to a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain sold for rations of tune of n5,000 in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, areas of property development in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "a driving force and central figure of a family."
According to court documents, the asset allocation ratio means Colin owns properties worth about quid and Paul worth about burglary.
Paul is not happy with the allocation of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first exclreipable testimony to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was heard by the Supreme Court for the first time since several mediation attempts.
The brothers are also now arguing over who controls existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true. He accuses Paul of poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first ominous certificates that he would like to reach a solution to the matter.
"In keeping with our traditions of the Italians, family is the most important to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of warrant statements, emails and reports. The case is being sorted out by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country's best and most experienced lawyers, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family to buy a property from Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he does not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The family's other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. Colin said Mark received 10,000 million dollars and Luke buck 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "a slashing of financial terms of departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being the best friend of a former board member of the Australian Football League club and television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded. He said in his text message that he could not comment on the matter because it will be dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother, Paul, has decided to sue me and draw our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to pass his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, telling me that he still hopes to reach a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone out.
"We will settle in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally succeeds.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news follow-up to keep the boss from running into trouble so often.
Editor Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly met with the management staff on her first day on a working day, bringing up a key problem she plans to solve: he plans to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information – printed as well as those heard at news conferences – must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship to television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If President-elect Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathizing media dealt with issues more equitably," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
At the time, Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote that "6 former campaign workers say it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know – maybe Trump tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have been able to prevent him from causing trouble, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the White House of competing factions trying to drive their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable, or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately give the president questioning information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can be hugely outraged by newspaper clippings criticizing him, especially if they tell of harmful leaks of information. He will have to know where the information came from.
That's what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of online provocation Charles C. A news story from GotNews.com, a website based by Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and retook them off later. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Even so, after reading the story, Trump had started asking staff about Walsh.'
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "had to try to introduce a system of managing documents going to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more powerful leader than Priebus, but Trump remains impulsive himself and his aides continue to drive his own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that representatives of Neymar had paid a buy-out price of 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
The staggering €222m transfer is the biggest in football history.
Previously, Manchester United paid 105 million euros from Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen beats alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the shape of my life"
Raija Oranen, a well-known best-selling author of Rose and Pure White Sheets, celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija from Ora.
Five grandchildren keep grandmas along with writing so that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their houses, but now a rental apartment also left in the spring.
To light and sun, out of old circles, Raiija was once taken away from depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external appearance is 20 pounds lighter.
Weight dropped when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
I once got help with hypnosis, which also worked to fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the beaming author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been travelling the same distance for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been working together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the queen of drama he's always been, ending his life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had a extensive career as a writer, only remembers 44 parts of the clean white sheets TV series, which touched and moved the Finnish Lama era.
I finally decided to join the fresh family’s company in the clothing industry when I read a 50th-year interview with Liisa Seppälä on a plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes acted as mannequins, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed Finns’ attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives active as a writer, she has many scripts in the works - ideas hundreds.
Circents returned over a ditch to 'millionaires' alleyway'
The West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again on a haircut with persistent rotatingers who managed to cross the municipality's much-needed ditch and return to a field next to the houses.
Kiertailers park some two dozen of their trailers near a street called millionaires' alleys in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but managed to cross a moat dug into a municipal barrier. They brought children, horses and a van army.
The conversaries managed to cross the barrier at a point left unprotected because of the path.
Entrushing residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of a "perfect inability to solve the problem."
A resident who remains anonymous says the orbiters came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown backers with rocks.
"The municipality needs to be toughened up to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The conversaries were here in May, then they left, but they came back again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more today.'
A resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"Apart on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when a municipality can't do anything about it."
Another anonymous resident says it's ridiculous for the tourers to return so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even put a horse-grabbing park."
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said the municipality was aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihullin Police to evict campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for gathering evidence that as many locals as possible report harassment or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for a court hearing."
Entrageous people surround Portuguese crash plane
Men who made an emergency landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died as a result of the forced landing yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
At the longest, it is punishable by 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A small plane flying by men had to make a forced landing at the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical fault yesterday.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran a landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man with his back to the plane.
Imfocused after, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told the newspaper Feilipeira Janeir on the beach to Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
Beachfront people surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash in anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it, said Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the case.
A man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle more people didn't die.
The two men on board were not injured in a forced landing.
Finnish star, who tragically lost his leg, won World Cup gold again: 'Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion'
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated World Championship gold early Wednesday morning Finnish time in a banked slalom held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won cross World Cup gold earlier at the Games.
In all, three World Cup titles have already been accumulated.
A pretty incredible World Cup!
Two times we took care of gold, we pulled with a pretty good heart rate, the Greater Hamari reached by phone rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are many new calculators involved.
I always wonder if a black horse comes in.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to go down from a young age with friends, and the accident didn't take the urge to get to the slope.
I think about my life without that accident.
But my attitude has always been to have no need to jostle.
With those cards, we play what has been shared, Suur-Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to titillating a serious accident and losing a limb to a stroke of happiness, and Suur-Hamari doesn't do that either.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say it turned to a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Greater Hamar's biggest gracious enthusiasm for boarding was already fading.
Duuni to the top started in earnest only after the accident.
I trained with friends when I was young, and we always caught up with X-Games.
But those were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in the X-Games start.
I could not have imagined beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stay here to get bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the overalls on my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased to select Leo-Pekka Tähti, a wheelchair reeler, as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for parasports people.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will also open eyes to the parasports world.
When is it time to launch two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's Athlete of the Year campaign?
We'll see that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Even now, Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks of lusts.
Next year there will be a big goal.
A year from now, the Paralympics will take place in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
A majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees basking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
A majority of Syrian youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen to them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, the communications bureau chain, investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youths in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18 to 24 years old, half of whom are women and half men responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home countries permanently in the future.
Forty-two percent of respondents may think they're going back to their home country and four percent couldn't say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) see the end of the war as the most impressive factor in permanent repatriation, while a quarter think the most important thing would be to leave ISIS.
Only less than a tenth highlight the most important factors contributing to the outcome of the economic situation to improve the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone won't solve conflict
Syrian youths were asked what factor is most important to end the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than President Bashar al-Assad's abdication of power.
A quarter see al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
A total of a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
A majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS power weakened in the past year, while a fifth of it feels its power has strengthened.
According to the defendants, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and usually against terrorism, is that the media would pass on people to know that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people made military measures and education reform a priority.
The most important thing for just over ten grand would be to create better paid jobs to young people.
Asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided into whether the involvement of Russia as well as Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time encodes to keep the web organized - the database he's developed by Wikipedia and Google, for example,
MariaDB, an Espoo-based company, is developing an open source database of the "fastest growing world".
MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenis, does not cost users anything at all, and can be developed online by any eminent programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With databases, huge masses of information remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's CTO, spends about half of his time encoding.
A man working remotely from Kauniainen makes sure that the internet is acting smoothly.
Widenis has developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for bucks for bucks, and a year later software giant Oracle devoured Sun at 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't make a definite promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a business at this point that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of the top two developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of code is secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was set up to oversee the development of MariaDB's code.
"During MySQL, these confirmations were not made," Widenius frets.
Although many people have heard about Widenity and MySQL’s multibillary trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50 percent a year," says Kenneth Paqval, MariaDB's CFO.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not making a profit yet, and Paqvalusn is scant about the company's signature figures.
That much is what he reveals that MariaDB estimates to receive 20 million euros worth of orders in the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which corporate customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which could be a contract of more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB, you can easily switch to MariaDB because they are versions of each other.
Spanish operator Telefzhnica and Southeast Asia's largest bank, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer its customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have links to the biggest players.
"Our customers include some of the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqval's list.
Database markets still predominate giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with closed databases.
For Oracle, too, MySQL is modest from a side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although research firm Gartner says the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still negligible, albeit fast-growing, musters.
In a database market of about 50,000 million, open source databases do not even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source can not be measured only in money, because the majority of users do not pay for these software.
In 2018, companies are developing more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open ones at that time or the transition would have started at least.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them choose open source code next.
This has led to a cloud of licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to be with a smaller number of customers," Widenius reflects.
Because the exchange of a closed database is cumbersome, the majority of customer companies have swallowed price rises obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old apps and others are attached to a closed database," Widenius says.
Still, he believes the measure of customers is coming to a full line.
When licensing fees rise every year, the customer will sooner or later switch to an open source database.
The price is 10 to 20 percent of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
Many people exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank, EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide to hire more now.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in countries such as Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalchen.
Wideniing is annoying how Finland is spending money on, say, closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the customer is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some people say open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that you can not think of or can do.
In addition to another Finnish developer of Linux, Widenius is one of the best-known open source promoters.
Wideniing helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source code.
I still have four to five speeches about this issue every year around the world.
Italy toughens attitude towards NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees in the Mediterranean with their vessels that they must not continue to operate unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to a new policy, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino-based newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship from the German aid organization Jugend Rettet. Its crew are suspected of cooperating with people smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for just a year, declined to comment on detailed charges by prosecutor prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosi.
“For us to save lives, it’s and will be the most important thing. We very much regret that we are not currently able to operate in a search and rescue zone," the organisation said in a statement posted on social media.
"We can only judge accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and we will be able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Iuventa platform since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boatloads of boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who reintroduced boats to reused.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a couple of miles off the Libyan coast. The information comes from a prosecutor's document published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area. The motive is the enthusiasm to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must involve an Italian police officer to monitor operations.
Only three of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far agreed to follow a code of conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not create "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders organization.
Minniti, for his part, noted that with the rescue efforts, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as an indication of efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his common-law spouse at Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case for prosecutors
The alleged crime took place in Kuttanen, Enontekiö, last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said the suspect would have fled to the terrain with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did no resistance when taken up.
The charge in the case must be filed within less than a week.
The case may still be thrashed out by the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-Horths, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began acting at the age of 24 in a theater.
During his long career, he also starred in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for playing the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the All-Horical Friends of TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for seven seasons in all.
Michelle Carter jailed for text messages instigated suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls to have conceded her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June. Her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
“My son was my best friend.”
Carter filed an appeal to the verdict and expected an application to be heard in freedom.
He faced a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a tearful look created to the ground.
"He committed killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was caused by "shocking circumstances Carter deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level, and even mental health issues, had no significant impact on what he did."
The prosecutor read a statement by Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "no day it will pass that I wouldn't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain we will always carry."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she was "spokes" by the thought of never seeing her brother's wedding and being aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never lets you down," Camdyn said.
There is a precedent to set a precedent for the state of Massachusetts to say incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car to carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it emerged that Carter, in his text messages, incited his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Home yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on a generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention to Roy's death. The judge ordered Carter to get no use of the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Very few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox opinion piece saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia Worst of Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia for the issue and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
But Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found relations between the U.S. and Russia even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to thank the Congress of the two countries last week approving new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback by car manufacturers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to upgrade software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW executive said the company believed "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions." He pointed to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, who are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about recalling.
European car manufacturers have marketed heavily on the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause carcinogens and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neficiating devices is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely watched, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of composing large car companies and ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but executives are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former director in charge of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Officials suspected Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent Europe's emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote begins fraud investigation, big protests in store
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a firm with no role in the election results," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro says crisis will end
Venezuela on Sunday elected a controversial vote to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organized its conversion against protests.
The opposition opposition to Maduro has postponed its own protests to be taking place at the time of appointment.
El Pais newspaper said the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. With them, rainfall in spring, especially autumn, has decreased markedly," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in agriculture in Provence.
"This reduces lavender life.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cassers to the region, spreading microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought after-mining ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
"Gent by long cocks and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or completely absent," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing watering, slowing soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, varieties that are more sustainable than drought are developed.
Reporter's murder poses growing threat in Mexico
The editorial board of the once-weekly Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities and an endless drug war in Sinaloa state.
But today we are discussing security over a recent tragedy.
Journalists have been told to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them into a delivery attack on a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words to the squirch board at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is required, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected to be on the payroll of government or drug cartels are written on the table. They are criminals who make the Mexican chaos newsring life-threatening.
Violence is non-stop, and more frequent attacks are targeted by journalists. According to the journalists' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pezha Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists targeted by attacks and threats under federal protection. At least seven journalists have been murdered this year.
The latest victims include Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodote, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is everywhere. The facade of the Riodocade building is covered by a huge image of Valdez showing middle finger. The picture reads, "Justity." Reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, who are in their 30s, are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a brand-made panama hat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Reporters discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
A federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 specifically to deal with journalists' cases, but the journalists Protection Committee said only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists murderers rarely go to trial, as are few of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year.
Riodote journalists plan to continue writing about Sinaloa's violence, even though they are grief-stricken and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting, frankly, is a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left Riodote's delivery in the state capital of Culiacan on 15 May 2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be linked to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn a wife and two adult children.
Rumours move fast and swirl freely in Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is mouse-down.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competitive factions want to fill a vacuum.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey tombing buildings larger than many homes.
The coastal state is "calm" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodode, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a rival faction of war against Guzman boys.
The case may have angered Guzman's sons: customers suspected of members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the paper came to sales outlets.
Another mistake was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had had a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish a Riododo with five colleagues. The newspaper shares were sold for 50,000 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem," Bojorquez tells me.
Over time, the magazine began to feel about its bold and honest stuff, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were captivated by stories in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award for the International Press Freedom Award for his courage to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico without relentless.
He openly admitted to fearing.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said in receiving a journalists Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The editor must take a task to him – or to act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when we sown dying here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodote staff miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave you a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a panahammer.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if routines were his downfall.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Cructives don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean businesses in our cases, their secret drug trade todges.
They were left out of the cases," Bojorquez tells me.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Relying on your own instincts.
If you don't think everything is right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodote reporter Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that's what happened in Javier's case."
Old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to a room where Riodocade's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had come to light that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had taken shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodote's premises, located in a four-storey building in a middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists speculated half jokingly whether the very two police officers were among the 50 percent that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited drug gang-controlled mountainous countryside.
To this week's issue, Riodote's delivery envisaged three main things.
Boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that government spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so careful progress had to be done: everyone in town knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI). The PRI has ruled Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its headcounters have recently been accused of corruption in cases of much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases at the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known to receive reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
"Early, we would have known what had happened," says Villarreal, 46, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco," Missy.
"Now all the connections to our sources are exhausted."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of suppliers are stored. The paper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists pushing for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him when he left outside the local prosecutor's office the next morning to a protest against another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body based on DNA tests by authorities was found, Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest loudly across the country. In protests, "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for investigating the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with Sinaloa Governor and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked him to be moved out of cases dealing with the government because he is worried that his anger will not be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, crime-promising authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book Narco-journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
The Articulo 19 control group said more than half of the attacks against journalists last year were caused by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was accompanied by a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the papers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, despite being assassinated in 2004 by its leader.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to the drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the entire country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be wary all the time.
Sometimes criminals searched a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was once to become a poet – admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he tells me.
Some time ago, Riodote journalists sat at midnight on Friday in front of a delivery on a sidewalk with a beer, after the latest issue of the paper was completed. Suddenly, their phones started to quiver to signal a message.
A shooting between rival gangs and security forces at a Mazatlan beach resort had killed 19 people.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on the Riodote's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
We had to re-enter the home the next day.
Sirens howl nearby – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at police guarding delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodote's editorial service continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait, in which a man shows a middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider ending operations. "How could I close the paper when our intern asked to go to the street to do a story on the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "A tough place"
Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, was short, as a professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
But the training season began to be catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
That was the start of a long period of illness that stretched to nearly five weeks.
In practice, May was completely ill.
First there was flu and finally, there was a pediatric disease like an ear infection that I had to eat into a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten per cent of planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I was sick so long.
It was a tough place to not take advantage of training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 world champion was not given training permission until the second week of June, which was evident in the roller mat test of the Racing and Top Sports Research Centre KIHU on June 12.
In the test, an athlete skis on roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I last fell on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I stayed for only 28 minutes.
A wall came up against it, Manninen says.
In a better direction
After initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
Midsummer was also a week and a half of a week of flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions ahead of the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was seen right in the opening race as Manninen moved up to 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and head coach of the national team Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to training last season.
After the first snow races, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cup races.
In December, the plan would be to be involved in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
In late January, plans would be to be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be found on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics of his career to Manninen.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, a Nummelalainen who celebrated gold in a team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002 underscores.
Dinosaur protected against his enemies by camouflage
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that the researchers could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur of all time and the world's best representatives of its species.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the culverting period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists see this amazingly well-preserving fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, armoured vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in a Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100-pound sloppy boulder.
The results of hard work are now available.
"If you squint eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," said science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Studies in the skin revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armour and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked its predators, and was also protected by darker and lighter colouring from the top, which is still found in many animals.
Experts said it was thus better able to mix with its environment and evade to its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May, and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Investigators have named it Borealope, markmitchelli, according to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician. Mitchell was a member of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig out a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has maintained so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a common colourway in the animal world, where the body is darker and lighter underneath.
Still, the observation was a surprise because Borealope has significantly larger than current animals with similar coloring.
That suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs prey on it to such an extent that evolution favors hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Of current animals, deer, zebras and armadillas, for example, have similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that a no-dosage was seriously threatened by a nodosaur.
"The predation of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the snare were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds of nodas of scales reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodo dinosaur to draw conclusions about its life. Among other things, they studied the contents of its bowel to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Investigators believe it fell into a river when it died and went to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas likely extended much further than they do today.
"This nodosaur is really significant because its scale leather has survived and has also remained three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost like early liberation
It doesn’t take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The season was an era of the theorphans, huge two-legged dinosaurs eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armoured dinosaur.
The precursors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-tone monster, about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified into the mud.
It was found in a Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with skins and armoured snouts from snout to hips.
Nodas fumbles were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two half-foot spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe this armoured vegetarian passed through what is now West Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has remained in a small detail in a sea-based grave.
Its fossilized remains so well that its leather remains in the pothole plates of the armour along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such a survival is "as rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, it feels more astounding.
Its kallopanssar's bumpy plates still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also calculate the scales of that soles of the sole of that foot."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: who do streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York City from his home in St. From Louis, sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment, scrolling Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"A police officer just killed an 18-year-old youth, and his body is still in the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That's why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retwesome retweements from : : TheePharoah.
The username belongs to St. For a rapper in Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. A white police officer had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Black in the state of Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's inanimate body on the street, where it was dumped for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone off. When he returned to Twitter later that night, there were reports of people gathering at Canfield Drive.
Users posted images of police lockdown tapes and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, whose sign beared it, read: "Ferguson's cop just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another officer riging his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers stating.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock last night. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson within the next three years has been the documentary "Whose Streets?" It premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is the story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a floral dress and a crown that is compatible with it, they had a re-conversation about "what is to live in blackness and in what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't miss my daughter with me," Ferrell later told me.
"The events of today are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow into it.
He must be equipped for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black. And he needs to know what we need to do to deliver ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect him from raucous racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located across from a police station. It became a campplace for activists as they waited for information on dealing with the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur making lunches.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he tells me. Studying at the University of Missouri in St. In Louis, Ferrell was president of a nurse student organization of minority nursing students. At the time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of a documentary.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "could simply tell you what was going to happen.
Ferrell's mind was drawn to suspicion. He asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's happening, or do you want a story you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was motivated by the countless times when people had appeared in a local community, usually whites, who wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born at Ferguson and raised had no common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among death row inmates.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The film crew followed the events in the years following the shooting at Brown.
"This is not a document where someone talks to us or speaks for us, we speak," Davis says.
"The most important thing to me was how local people are portrayed in a movie because I'm portrayed in the same way."
Folayan said the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because they wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but a community." But Ferrell proved to be the most open to filming.
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as she told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human depiction of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
Plus, Ferrell's story recaps and re-enters the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media ('BlackLivesMatter) after a police shoot a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of queer women in the muskrats has kept the whole movement going on," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.'
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed run by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women."
But he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got energy moving," Folayan says.
"But it's no coincidence he was on the front line. Black queer women live on many issues at the cutting point, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the big screen.”
Ferguson has been dumped by news film crews long ago, but relations between the community and the police remain tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years of parole left. He was convicted of blocking the motorway at a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home corners is brief and concise: "A snub."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized in the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Appropriate resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has a hanging of a showroom face in the middle of a showroom – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, serving his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is backed by two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose jail sentence was reduced by Barack Obama on the third last day of his tenure.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, if somewhat theoretical statement about the editing of DNA data, ambiguousness and cause-effect relationships behind interpretations, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly shared that he identified with women since the puberty. He was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences, including espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which the afflicted Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car. He has a platinum-bloncing wig on his head, becoming his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a great popularity behind him in 2015 of the Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic information. He received DNA data on things like cigarette pumps and chewing gummies and created pictures of what the people at issue might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference at a new exhibition.
Manning couldn't visit and he couldn't be photographed in prison. So the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence mates. They wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future in which the president would have reduced Chelsea's verdict and would get to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's verdict after just a few diaries of publishing a comic book. It was a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump is waging his own war against leakers and transgender soldiers, coming up with more and more ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divides he was actually supposed to de-escalate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "anything has a purpose."
On the gallery wall is an artist's statement and underneath Manning's large autograph, with a heart score of the surname i.e. In a statement, the artist calls for an end to an "automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is the Manning DNA sequence: a long queue of letters C, G and A written pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, such as the artist’s scientific definition, is, Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition helps people understand that we are of equal value from our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and transparent to interpretations," Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also features his 2007 Spurious Memories video work.
“DNA tells me countless stories. 30 of them are on display here.”
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page of the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, in hand a megaphone.
"If they silence you, they will win," the photo reads.
“Never shut up.”
"The text is about a letter I received from Manning," an artist from Philadelphia tells me.
"It's so impressive, I still get chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a crowd of protesters in the middle of a showroom.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"Faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe a mass movement born by Chelsea, which was behind his release, too."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought murder suspects
Police say they launched a nationwide search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show arrest warrants issued Monday on Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he was stabbed several times.
A local statement released by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incision wounds to his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as murder. Police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Vice-Rector of Public Relations at the University, Alan K. In an e-mail statement, Cubbage stated that Lathem is now administratively off-duty and banned from access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter being investigated by authorities, and Northwestern University is helping to investigate," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior assistant in financial management at Oxford University.
A statement emailed by a spokesman from the university and Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were upset and hoping to surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief information officer at the Chicago Police Department, said he would urge suspects seriously to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly reasting our search," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find suspects.
He said police had received a call from a manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip about something happening at the apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as horrendous.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board issued a statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic abuse."
Man Threatens to Detonate Islamic Bookstore and 'Kill Muslims' in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convict told the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "toamp all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
Police said they were alerted to the scene by bookstore staff on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called police for threats.
The threats were not related to the events of the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as a suspect in a bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police officers during interrogations.
As punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay legal fees of 6.820 pounds, or about 6.990 euros, and compensation of about guise, or about 95 euros, to victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said several hate crimes were left unreported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said Russia will soon complete efforts under the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA road map to reinstate the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RAFA).
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently posted on the organization's website.
Mr Mutko said it contains nothing of concern to Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
But one of the road map points requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study by WADA-mandated by Canadian jurist Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the alleged state involvement in Russian sport doping.
That's what Mutko said: "The study is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can't admit what didn't exist.'
Mutko's words contained echoes of a statement by Vitaly Smirnov, president of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Smirnov, speaking to Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, acknowledged that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the scale of the doping scandal was discovered.
However, it was given permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD last June.
Mr Olivier Niggli, head of WADA, visited RUSADADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was on a "right path" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: There is no evidence of health benefits of maternity packaging 'no evidence'
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, say the Lullaby Trust, which fights against catchy deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of SIDS.
Cuckoo death is an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health officials in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow us to pack our official brochures on them, because it would imply that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the world's lowest child mortality rates, only two dead per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of a number of different reasons, including a low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving every family a box there might be one factor.
But that can't be said for sure," said Francine Bates, chief executive of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIZE mortality.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The kit includes a variety of accessories, including children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products on the packaging.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where a child can be put to sleep.
The boxes it distributes, according to the Scottish Government, meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, meanwhile, says there is no security standard for cardboard boxes to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no crib or a cot available.
The organization recommends using packaging for nap only and stop using it at the point when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and making sure it doesn't get wet or get dirty.
Viquit villain escapes Japanese zoo for a second time
Staff at a Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway tortoise.
The giant turtle has surprised staff at his speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from a Shibukawa Zoo in western Japan at Okayama on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed the villain left the zoo through an excellation.
It doesn't die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told me.
The 35-year-old villain escaped female, 55-pound and about three feet long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to pass freely in the area of the farm.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of a turtle.
The previous run of the villa occurred the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down a road 150 yards from a zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store startup firm, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the polls are anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," Errett tells me. As an attempt at hair care, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
There have been more and more new types of HR start-ups entering the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can survey and target specific teams and demographic groups, as well as to provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact past senior management to government.
"You can follow your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the Fitbit of companies?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint software for three years. He says he has gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to conduct rapid queries and votes for specific teams. In addition, it can create a map showing at a glance which wards in which employees are most dissatisfied and which managers have received the weakest estimates. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realised they need to follow workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber. There has been turmoil around the transport company since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture of harassment of employees and punctuated those talking about problems.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, can reach more than  USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a blow.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make customized queries, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect a director of inunprinisities, complaints go directly to the firm's board.
"A general opinion has displaced authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and chief executive.
He reminds us that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences could be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting a business, and it could also lose workers and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and easily connect to head office.
Previously, it was the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out a phone number or email address to report to head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel. He said complaints from employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I'll have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, which leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies understood that they could no longer prevent public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to controlling ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model accepted by private equity investors and an opportunity. Both Glint and Convercent have backing venture capital investors.
Convercent raised quid in February 10,000 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised a total of DM47 million of capital.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of 10,000 million euros in funding.
Investments are no surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and give their time to a truly useful company.
"Employees are more committed to a company's success if they enjoy being comfortable at a company and feeling they're being listened to and rewarding," said Nina McQueen, head of LinkedIn, who is in charge of employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder investors are of interest to investors.
Experts in workplace culture say information about employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if there is no change quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," Russell Raath, president of management consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much to collect information alone.
"If a company doesn't take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
And whether their opinions matter.
If a company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?'
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts staff surveys monthly and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After Errett had gathered feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday will understand its employees even better and hope that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the sustainability of staff in a long-term industry known for high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it will lose customers.
There are no companies without customers.”
A 20-year-old man in Sweden is suspected of secretly photographing his naked female neighbor, according to news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of a shower at her home after spotting a cell phone hanging outside her window at a rope.
The woman said a cellphone camera shot into the apartment.
A woman who was startled by the incident had run to another room to dress.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the cellphone had been pulled up first, but soon after it was recalculated to the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of cover photography has admitted to photographing a woman.
But he claimed to have only photographed a woman's face.
The video shot on the cellphone had been removed and police had failed to return it as evidence.
During questioning, the man admitted to the act but denied committing a crime.
The man had justified his filming by saying he loves his neighbour "just crazy."
The TT news agency said the man was charged with the incident.
Teachers demand more payout in autumn talks
Salary development cannot be lower than, for example, an export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, President of OAJ, on Thursday.
A temporary cut in public sector furlough payments highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude contracts where the review does not include any holiday money cuts made in some way.
In the local government sector, contracts are only expected to be awarded when private sector papers have been signed and increases are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that OAJ’s terms of employment, for example, have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals were not yet revealed.
Luukkainen is also chairman of the public sector-treacher negotiating organisation Jukko.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cut increases earnings-development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, a temporary furlough money cut will further sharpen earnings-based differences.
In Finland, we need to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest people are growing.
The organization says learning outcomes are declining, and differences between pupils and regions are constantly growing.
Bruins players' day lengthened as NCAA reduced daily drills to one of two
It's almost 11 o'clock tonight. A group of UCLA American football players have been left to talk to the other side of the new training ground on campus.
Some have taken off their jerseys. Their backs shine from sweat after the first day of toiling training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chatting is a midday break.
Players studying at university summer courses return to the dorm after three hours of practice to read final exams. The next morning, they gather at 6:30 p.m. at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days to come in a tough one for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The college sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to lighten the number of players’ workload, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises began at 15 minutes past seven in the evening. It was hard to find space in the players' full schedule anyway.
Limiting internships to one a day means there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the season of Westwood coaching for Mora's six seasons, when training is held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for a season opener begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We really scare them for three or four days, and that's a very challenging one," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it will get easier when we get to Saturday. Then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes exercises to outsiders after camp. It's not easy considering a direct view of training fields to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a classy hotel already bombed by footballs flying across a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to a hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits problems could arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora tells me.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there for video. That is not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of money is paid for video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head with it too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom to Rwanda
Central African Rwanda will hold a presidential election on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has contributed to the country's management since 1994.
That's when the rebel group, the RPF, ended genocide orchestrated by ultrahusband.
Kagame was an RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
For a third term, Kagame will be able to seek to seek to move the constitution that capped the two terms of president.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investment has been flowing into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the land shared by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagame has promised more freedom to his people after the country is put on its feet.
This could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up checking of facts
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to independent fact inspectors increasingly, as well as present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced Thursday.
The company posted a statement on its website saying it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news distributors. Many believe that fake news contributed to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
The subject has come up for a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before May's presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September election, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they don't erase hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in Germany, Facebook announced that the verification of facts would be trialled in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't penetrate the sieve of independent inspectors. They also want more background information to decide more informed about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager at Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known by Squeezge's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history. Now this charming location in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a multidisciplinary author of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says longingly.
"I feel personal contact when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to Edwardian time. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first archive-based book. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was the sources of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in a letter. The letter was written by a double agent working for Jacobs in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he is on the ground.
I love the archives!”
The author, who attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Art Council, which seemed too good to be true. He admits he couldn't stay in jail for a little longer without delay than would have been desired.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles of moat that have been in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins of an old castle on the ruins and estates and talked to forest guards, gardeners and sometimes the artists who illustrate the book.
In the evenings, he "wasting whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle passed to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation's staff were just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: by taking all the extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "There they were even a few birches here.
I thought it would be.”
Some of the stories in the book proceed from castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It is about a man associated with the peasant spin in England in 1381 shortly after the castle's graduation.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that rebellion can start with a riot.
“Maybe these events are connected?”
The book's other stories are closely associated with the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story of a priest hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral with a casket-filled rocks (it was spotted years later when his tomb was opened).
Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been quite a bunch of wickets. They were constantly in debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who could court an heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks writing a comic book about Life hill, a sanatorium of the sanatorium, which was operating in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophicated plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he tells me.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this damn everyday life."
The worst of Russia since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia for the issue and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
But Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found relations between the U.S. and Russia even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to thank the Congress of the two countries last week approving new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko ends - rematch against Anthony Joshua won't happen
Vladimir Klitschko, a long-time world heavyweight champion in professional boxing, is ending his career.
Klitschko, 41, from Ukraine, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 49 times as a professional victory, winning 64 of the fights.
He held various World Cup titles from 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him by points in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost a frenzied fight after a frenzied fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitschko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to distance myself enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
I achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitschko's reasoning for his decision on video.
Klitschko manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
But he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation left.
That’s why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, a daughter, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled World Cup titles of various federations at the same time.
Finland weather breaker to beckon by conditions: 'Take a vibe'
Minna Nikkanen, pole vaulter, has suffered from conditions during the outdoor iron season of the summer.
I have had problems with circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken a woman's vibe.
Even at the World Cup in London, there are unstable conditions.
I'm talking about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against pole vaulter Minna Nikka.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get small stakes moving properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and trained here for God knows how many times I have never experienced such a mixed wind in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi at the Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unsettled winds in training, Nikkanen stated at Kaleva races.
The weather was also in London on Thursday.
It's been pretty challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold jam or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken a vibe.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad circumstance.
He made it to the World Championships thanks to his gym 455.
It's been 445 outside.
The conditions in London are not the same for everyone.
You have to be composure and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualifier.
Why don't you move to training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump together and the technology rationed.
I should have done the same thing now.
Normally you've got to the hangar to train, now the hall has been closed.
What would it be ideal to race?
25 degrees.
There's a small wind, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official bristled at Yle: "We don't have any allocation for now or for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä’s Government must keep ice in the hat and be wary of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there is no room for division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed a retired Virta in Wednesday’s first morning.
Building next year's government budget is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals to raise the guarantee pension, lower car tax and support e-bikes are election speeches.
They mainly indicate that the election is getting close because, when ten per cent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it is a betrayal to talk about a distribution resource when you take on debt, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owes children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing government budgets: in 1978 he started as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Budget Manager.
Before his retirement, he served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the now forecast three per cent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike, from which we will go to the lower level of the trend next year, and Finland is facing a growth of tens of years.
Washington changes permanent residence permit rules
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of a permanent residence permit, or Green Card, will be changed by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the demands of temporary work permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raise wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit from applicants who can speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said, according to media reports.
The Danish Queen's spouse doesn't want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her wife Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, pairs of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The royal house has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried at Roskilden Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, this is due to the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in a Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, the court's communications chief, commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to her spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a gravesite and understands the decision.
Terrifying moment on the road: Car almost hit on highway
Tommi had a cohabiting partner and two young children on board.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive any money from insurance if one party is not reached.
The crash happened at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law spouse Riina and the couple’s two young children drove on a motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the connection of Ring III to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along an acceleration lane, which was to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without evasive action, the car would have come on top of Tommi's.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit a railing at high speed.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other under one year old.
Obviously it was pretty lucky to have nothing happened to us.
No one who passed drove even pushed us, even though there was a lot of traffic at the place.
The accident happened at around 5:20 p.m.
Tommi said no one stopped at them, and the family called emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and emergency services personnel showed up, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says he and the common-law spouse have low incomes, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family, according to Tommi, the family will not receive any money from insurance.
That's why the family wishes eyewitnesses to detecting a car that caused the family to ride to a railing.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take children to the farm and work without it,” Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was likely from the end of the 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's license plate number was SIG.
If the blame is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes those who have seen what happened or know anything about it are connected to the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission to the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
The headline and story were corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, another car did not come to the oncoming lanes, but was to drive from acceleration to the side of the family car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the performance deals with relationships through humor - A self-declarant will be seen at What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her debut directorship to the What? Theatre.
The self-discovery is a musical theatre performance of botched relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes me feel good.
The subject is addressed through humor.
You don't get caught up in nasty emotions, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the tourable summer theatre performance has been implemented with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges us to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he pulling a role, or is another jacket approaching open?
A plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both guided and dramatized the performance.
He's also responsible for lights.
The performance consists of the working group's texts and there is no plot.
The director believes that even though the performance draws on young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Convident detective does not directly tell about his own relationships or the relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my values will be conveyed by the show.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I also, that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a happiness condition.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Exposing Artist draws a timely picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
He said many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance stars Minea Long, Niklas Rauthenn and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for theatre ignites in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to direct theatre at Turku University of Applied Sciences’ Art Academy.
We've got two years behind him and another hell ahead of us.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for theatre has started during Kouvola’s years.
The music classes have been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
There is growing interest in directing.
The self-explored premiered last week in Helsinki on the scene of a Fool.
The performance, which lasts about 45 minutes, will also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen’s study city of Turku.
Self-reflected artist Kouvola's What? Theatre on 4 August at 7pm and 7pm on 5pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers from gruesome motocross accident for a year - cervical spine fractured
Few athletes in Finland are similar to the unstoppable natural power of Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the godfather swerved around the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Bay Area continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on the ground that a Chemijärvi resident would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired training.
There is always something new, Lahti says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop the Bay Area completely.
In 2014, Lahti was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical column and both hands broke.
I was nowhere to work.
I licked wounds at my house for a year, Lahtela says.
The Bay Area was in bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the crash.
Driving a bike may sound frenzied.
But I didn't apply for boundaries.
It's just so tough as a sport that forties like this you shouldn't have to do too much!
After the accident, Lahti was put in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long scurry behind me as head coach of the Japanese freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the job immediately after ending his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do much, he said.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged his protitarists on slopes and physics tests.
Amazingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't seem to make sense.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because I really got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtila to become Finland's head coach.
Without a stop, he feared to have burned out.
It's easier to find places in Kropa that's gone off than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realised I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I swapped motocross for disc golf!
It took a mitten right away.
At worst, I was seven hours a day to throw.
Although Lahtila has always been a super enthusiastic trainer, he does not insist on his coaches to be the same as him.
I won't force everyone into the same mould.
In our sport culture, there is room to be our own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in keeping with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to worry about us
It’s here: a report on technology development in the sex robot industry – just as it started to feel like 2017 can’t get weirder.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within five to ten years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," said Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield, a founding member of the foundation.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, nipple shape, and type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being sniggered, but they are already selling quite a lot of them, and we're going to see them even more," Sharkey said at the report's launch.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin, as well as artificial intelligence-generated features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences, from eye color to nick shape and finger nail type and color.
What is all the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to user preferences, say, shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in a mood of talk or "in a mood."
There are many worrying aspects of the proliferation of sex robots. They replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot programmed to shy and resistance, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
“Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?'
But sex robots aren't just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development indicates something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
But marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people start acting strangely or offensively only when the market gives permission to do so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have become more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and a president sitting in the White House serving to harass women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale, the bandit is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, such as images of gallowed bodies and eye dug out. The most distracting is how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There is so much attempt to make sex robots like real women (by proportions of pornography stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements mimic human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave a relationship or a situation.
They have neither the will nor history of their own – nothing to suggest independence or a fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two acts of terrorism planned for Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The chief of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take a bomb to an Etihad Airways plane.
A member of the senior ISIS figures, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
The suspicions were to be taken to board a plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security capture.
Police would not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device dissecting toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example on public transport.
Michael Phelan, the Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, says the terrorists' plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were taken into custody over suspected terrorist plans in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his hearings will also continue.
Good things about Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like a paraloy of common sense
During the Trump term, it has already been repeated to the point of saturation that the strong division of voters has also broken down families at the level of everyday life.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper advisory boards guided how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to puncture our information bubbles.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'll tell you this because my cousin was visiting me this week with me in New York. He is a left-wing poet based in Chicago who has long been buttoned up against our family Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all acquaintances – including a Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it's a good thing, but more broadly, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we're talking about the frightening opportunity that one day we won't be able to terrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is even more abhorrent possibility that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, who suddenly seem to be quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember, wistfully Mitt Romney's undermining version of madness: a dog on a car roof, a 14 percent income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump's term is over, the Republicans' next presidential candidate only needs to be lucid, and that immediately seems like a substantial improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to Central Park carousel. It's the biggest merry-go-round in New York City's park section and the best you get in New York City for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals looking behind in terror – are ominous, and the cheating music in the background is oddly fascinating.
Many of New York's signature circles become disappointing over time: views of high-pitched buildings are getting boring, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And I still haven't gotten over 35 years of getting completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't a Swiss cabin but a large roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-inspired pub, but it doesn't count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – to such an extent that two two-year-olds, eleven-year-olds and two women in their 40s enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the merry-go-round full score if someone had asked me to make my assessment, but thankfully no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at a department store to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card in a reading device.
The same thing in the cafloche in my home corner, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15 per cent service allowance with the estimate when I go to get a coffee at the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service to put their personality on a game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store's salesman smiled in an apologetic feeling when I tiredly gave my credit card user experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - 'There was no management confidence'
FC Inter have today relieve Shefki Kuqi of the club's representative team coaching role.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously worked as an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching group will continue in its current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach at Sunderland, England, among others.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Hshkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the confidence of the club's management, with no other alternative now," H-kans said in a club statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching group, he will be responsible for tomorrow’s home match against HIFK.
According to reports from the Evening News, the team has been roiled throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches, Piccareta, and John Allen have been relegated.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed heavily at Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo of the 80s - would you recognise a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hash-washeds have been added to the picture, which lead to the conclusion that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders seriously about a young woman looking into the camera.
Long ago, serious, he signals.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it out here.
Lampenius has published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just over a year ago, she posted a pair of photos of herself on Instagram.
In one photo, he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he poses now, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders, of which he was younger, suffered from.
Exactly 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like," Lampenius wrote.
After text, he had added a hashtags of life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love of yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating scent of previous years.
He was in hospital at 14 years of age for anorex and ortorex.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was not finally discovered until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts on his wrists, which he received after falling in a cell, according to prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealing the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in a toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too lenient.
The Prosecutor General plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' conviction could extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry announced, according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. There were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation into the incident continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced its release of Bulgarians.
Greek authorities have tightened rules for free campsites and already giving substantial fines to anyone camping in areas outside the intended use.
Inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The ministry indicated the court might impose a fine.
Neste's share sinks - already sinking -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's stock has sunk 7.7 percent at around 11am.
Its earnings before taxes fell, but surpassed a forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The exchange trade has started today at a mildly below freezing side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of exchanges, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had slumped 0.2 percent.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange's general index OMXH had fallen 0.3 percent after about half an hour of trading to 9509.48 points and OMXH25 of the most traded companies had slumped 0.3 percent.
The total turnover of the exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was Neste, the morning earnings releaser.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares to the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease of about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the head of the study, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammation-causing cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If balance drops too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacter needs tryptophan to start developing immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We experienced a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reutter is part of a normal intestinal microbiota," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan in mice diets, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same is true in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuterial and a high-drug diet containing tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
In researching immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiome of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungus and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the brainstorming DNA of mice were examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteriacacters were administered to mice grown in a sterile environment without intestinal microbiota and not developed immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in fluid and transferred small amounts of liquid – without bacteria to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerability-confirming cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned of liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of tolerable cells increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, cell counts dropped to half of the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-confirming cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteriacacter cells develop in humans in the same way as mice. However, in people with irritable bowel syndrome, glucose-related genetic defects have been observed.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteriacacts bacteria may contribute to their increasing frequency."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a 'genius' after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United won a "genius" after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder will debut for Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for pharmacies for 10,000 wins in Dublin, in the final game of United ahead of the final season of the United ahead of a UEFA Super Cup tournament match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
But Matic was not yet in the best shape because he was not involved in a blue-ip shirt Asian tour before the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch – that’s what Mourinho says is going to change before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and mindset make him a genius – he has an inherent football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll make him ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more new players, even though the club has already done "great work" by acquiring three of his four players prior to.
"Three of four – you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth World Cup qualifier to Germany straight from rounds 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of gaming is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept their opponents in a tight spot, but in the third set Germany were clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressive enough, we were able to get bogged down,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three of four matches, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Great jury already sent challenges related to Trump Jr. Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges related to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A large jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin affiliations.
That's according to Reuters news agency, which at the same time confirms the news from the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about convening a large jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges related to a meeting of Trump Jr. and the Veselentskaya, known for the Kremlin affiliations, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current White House adviser.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington marks a closer pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help an investigation to determine Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia in the matter.
A grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on an affidavit.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
A large jury weighs evidence cleared by the prosecution in an investigation and decides whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor microchips himself to get to his home and his car with a flick of a hand
The British inventor has become the first in the whole country to microwave himself so he can open the front door of his home, get to his office and start his car with a flick of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northamin BioTeq technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant to an anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of a microchip meets medical standards.
The microchip uses similar techniques to microchips for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also converts locks for houses and cars to be compatible with a microchip. One lock costs quip quid.
Northam is married, and has one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which kicks in when he put his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's recent decision to fly a naval helicopter to a White House Southern grassy airport for an event showing American production cost taxpayers 4,000. The information is based on military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was an attraction at an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017 to showcase American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials were introduced to products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, a sailboat from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississip were on display.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter to the scene with a mission-by-function order only about 36 hours before landing at a southern grass court for a "extraordinary" event. This is evident from the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of exposure," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail message to his supervisor, who is an assistant compromise of the Navy Air Force.
The message said a helicopter would arrive at a southern grassy field at 7 a.m. on July 17, and the event would start at three in the afternoon. A helicopter would only leave the scene after a grassy field emptied between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House were delayed, another crew would be needed because of service hours restrictions.
The original crew was in a helicopter during the incident, and unit security personnel were at the helicopter's office while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was violated the Hatch Act. We were told not to be broken," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commandant replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of health care reform in its handling of the Senate as well as looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions drew attention in February as Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor's presidential plane use on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 unit regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on a southern grassy field bringing the president to the White House intent accuracy.
When Trump was at a G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 practice landings for the White House.
One official said flights to the Made in America event included a monthly training quota for the crew.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day in "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said there were no other costs to taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation at the White House's southern grass court.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to presidential duties, and accurately assessing the cost of the event is difficult.
According to Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly allowances, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is naught nil at EK 24,380 for air traffic class.
According to HMX-1, flights from Quantico base from the state of Virginia to the White House took a total of one hour.
The White House says the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"Counting costs for tax payers according to compensation level is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated reimbursement level includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in annual allocations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Around the time of the incident, Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, excused helicopter use at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defense supplies that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is absolutely appropriate to make it pointed out.”
It's not certain whether Trump went to a helicopter during the incident, but at least he smothered to the fire engine driver's seat.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

Venezuela's state prosecutor calls for court to block appointment of country's new repreatening
Venezuela's state prosecutor has sought a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body in the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegate, elected in last Sunday's vote, is to be appointed on Friday.
In a disputed vote, a representative body was elected to the country, which could, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision has been requested over suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the position after a British company that organised a representative vote told me that the results had been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the House, and the elected 545-member Representative Council includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to changing the constitution, the Representative Council can dissolve an opposition-led congressman and change laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees shaping the constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, meanwhile, have announced that they do not recognise a new representation.
Maduro claims the new Representative Council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela sank into an economic crisis after oil prices dropped.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when a new council of delegates is scheduled to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in U.S.
On Thursday, a Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senahi to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border officials as he was returning home.
Finland turned Senahi to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, according to the AFP news agency.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March this year to gain millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
The U.S. Department of Justice says Senah will be deported from the country after serving a prison sentence.
Russia's Foreign Ministry harshly slammed Finland after his arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States complained that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
Prosecutors said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish out usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used data by continuing to direct internet traffic to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Justice Department's Crime Department, the incident shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cybercriminals of other activities.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali cartel takes lead in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will be seen in a third season and a fourth season. The trailer for season three has been announced, introducing new villains to the show.
In the third season, the DEA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company," except there is a little more corruption and violence from authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles contacts with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a recent trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peshana, recruiting U.S. and Colombian policemen to war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola executes an exceptional light artwork in Paris
Light artist Kari Kola from Joensuu (in a kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional light art work to celebrate the first day of Light set by the UN in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola makes a light artwork in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument in front of it.
I want to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution from multimillion-dollar cities is a significant problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make things I feel visible to the issues I have found to be visible in a concrete way, says light artist Kari Kola from her work.
I am very honored to be involved in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he lit up Unesco's headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to re-fularting my art to Unesco headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will inform you about this later in the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise awareness among people in the fields of science, arts, culture and sustainable development.
The first day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in a shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men were contentiously in Espoo in the parking garage of the Iso Omena shopping centre on Wednesday morning.
The parties said the dispute was sparked when another side accidentally drove into a forbidden direction of driving.
There was a word of mouth between drivers.
The driver, who was driving in a prohibited driving direction, swung the driver of another car, causing his car to start crashing into a batter's car.
He then hit the hood of a still colliding car.
In a preliminary speech, the man has admitted causing the damage and doing wrong.
Timo Soini's question-titled article: "After that came a deluge"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post titled questioning on Thursday.
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a governing party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the deluge, now it all floats, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
The Madame Louis XV or his mistress's Madame de Pompador is known to have used a deluge metastag.
Depending on the interpretation, history books have been followed by the statements "we of the decay" or "after me a deluge."
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
Elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, the head of the UN Embassy in Afghanistan, said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the U.N. aid embassy, said hundreds of women are running for provincial councils' elections, three women seeking to run as vice president and more than 30 percent of recent registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has voiced threats to elections at the same time as international troops are moving into a consultative role.
This year's election is the first time power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's contribution to strengthening democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threat to region's culture
Officials are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
Italy's culture minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: we're only a few hours at the destination and rush through big crowds of sights.
Venice is a scrambled for leisurely trips to city-made tourists.
It's hard to move around the narrow streets and the fancy squares are so crowded by visitors that Venice residents can't fit in again.
They have been forced to move further and further from the historic centre while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian are written about by tourism in Venice.
Officials are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You follow a ticket-making guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Market Square, and turn back, describes Italian Culture Minister Dario Francesch of tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit at the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
Locals also anger are mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetsiers protested against mass tourism.
They say tourism has reduced their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was taking part in a demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring the revenue it desperately needs to Venice and create a need for numerous workplaces in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is for cruisers to go further from a historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.

Bad miles of congestion on motorway
The northbound lane on the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has been running for miles from work on Thursday afternoon to return traffic.
The area is being used to reheat the motorway, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50km/h speed limit for roadworks instead of a normal speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
Even in a 50-kilometer restricted area, traffic had proceeded virtually at a walking pace in some places on Thursday afternoon.
The roadworks proceeded on Thursday afternoon at the Expression statue, the Golden Cap of Revelation.
I get along well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has posted stunning photos of herself in the Grand Canyon, among other places.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in his current native Norway, not least because in March he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400m race by touring the track circuit at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record of the 400m hurdles at 55:38.
Iuel, who uses hard social media, was able to see shortly after his record record that cullingness and publicity have its downsides.
Men around the world began sending Iuel images of his genitals, apparently in the hope of being taken into interest to them.
Iul had to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "striking" from strangers, so I had to change my account to private," Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You can guess, Iuel chuckles.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll do well without that kind of other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish father of a Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalis were 2 years old.
When the Amalis were 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of his father's work.
After that, it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions but just issue orders.
In Norway, a coach has much more time to engage personally with an athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in 400 metres and 400m hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korve on the line of his entire career - now involved in the World Cup: "Nice to get hurting"
It's been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport this season.
As recently as last summer, career continuation was at stake.
A footing stress injury had forced Korpi to the operating table in January, and his leg didn't want to get better.
The hand, too, had taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was going to do, whether boarding would continue or not.
Sponsoroids were cut short and many things open, Korpi says.
But they say things tend to work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued to contract for two years, and the blood started to pull the slope again.
The decision was easy after that.
I knew it at the very least when I went to snow for the first time.
I was like, damn it, this one thing is so fun again, let's pull out for a couple more seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September-October, but after a long break in decline, just training painlessly has been a big deal.
There are only a few races.
I don't mind.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I have never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years to one race, and then you're on a fever for that week.
I can’t think that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi will race in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Spain's Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races don't hold him with boarding, in tough company racing he always lights up.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, even though some boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, visibility is high.
I think appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Sierra Nevada team of 12-member teams in Finland.
The team’s young people, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to watch younger guys go.
I remember at the point where everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up with some time, but otherwise I don't, there's plenty of guys to power!
In the background of his boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sporting career.
The son of director Pekka Korve is addicted to race sports: the boarders have his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I’m traveling all the time, there’s no time to be in the mess hall.
But I look at at least the race results every day and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, Raviohjaing and race training are a potential career plan when a boarding career is completed in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like I'm just about studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of time and develop, maybe in the summer you drive some departures.
If it’s my future profession, it won’t be hard to start when you’re already inside the sport.
The ravi stories also include an Elitloppet rafting with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship heading to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to bring the old tradition back to life.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been thrilled.
We are already at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
A few more months to go, let’s hope to get the ship full, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new care home of 41-bed elderly people to be built for Kitee.
The building of more than 1,700 square metres of flooring will be completed next summer to the other side of Health Road next to the health centre.
The general wonder of the question is where customers are enough for a new care unit, as many private care homes are currently experiencing a shortage of clients during Siun sote.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, comments that Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerikka from Kitee.
The deal involved business, but real estate reportedly has a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on this today later.
GMB worries about continued operations of McVitie's brand's Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the managers of the McVitie's inventive manufacturer of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the UK General Trade Union (GMB), the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products, has over 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than phonophobia in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives are "signed first" if there are changes to the operation.
In a letter to the factory manager, the GMB urges the company to "equip to worry about the lack of funding for modernizing production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union finds it very worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Family have worked from generation to generation here, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The plant is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low incomes.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising living costs and continuous reduction of production, eastern Glasgow desperately needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had only received a union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it values constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we talked openly about a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and insecure companies, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and offices to maintain our competitiveness."
A spokesman said the company has invested more than quid in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and operational improvements.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a manufacturing facility and will be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant."
Did PSG Wary of Barcelona's Transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Compareratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon the pursuit of Neymar after paying a transfer of 9% to terminate the contract. But did PSG Warrant to Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of colonizations. The previous record was less than half as low: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a bloke of 198m.
After the move, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him a weekly salary of more than GP500,000 pounds after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious at PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left company. A source close to Barcelona says the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did PSG president warn of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matud in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG players.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're looking for our players, we're going to be their opponents and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're looking for our players, they will face consequences.'
Barcelona seems to have committed this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona lose their star player Neymar because of this.

NYT: Trump's glowing calls were made up - White House spokesman: 'I wouldn't say it was a lie'
The White House admits that two phone calls cited by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump incensed calls with both the Mexican president and the head of a Scout organization have been invented.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
But he said Trump did not lie.
Sanders said many of the Scouts' leading figures spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto Trump had spoken to the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not only happened on the phone but face to face," Sanders argued.
Talk to Boy Scouts sparked outcry
Trump said Monday that Mexico's president called him and praised Trump for successfully eradicating illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people will come across Mexico’s southern border because they know the journey to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement Wednesday saying there had been no call in question.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of an interview with The Wall Street Journal by Trump.
In it, Trump enthused his speech at a major meeting of a National Scouts organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Scout Boys Leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, a Boy Scouts organization announced it was unaware of any of its executive's phone calls to Trump.
According to the statement, an earlier statement by the organization's head of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, apologizing to Trump's speech from the Boy Scouts, speaks to his side.
Trump's speech at a Scout organization meeting sparked a lot of puzzlement, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, glowed at the results of last autumn's presidential election.
