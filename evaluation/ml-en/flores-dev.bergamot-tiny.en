Stars provide light and heat through the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are merged together to have high elements.
Scientists are working to build a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it will take years to make useful fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on the water due to the surface pressure.
The surface force is caused by the attraction between the molecules of the surface of the water and the air molecules above them attract each other.
Water molecules create an invisible spot over the surface of the water, which is why objects such as needle float in water.
The double trunk of modern ice skate has a curved hole inside. 2 Trucks give better grip on the snowy place.
Since the bottom of the blade is small curve, the blade tilts from 1 side to the other side, and the end associated with ice is curves.
This causes the skator to turn. If the skats rotate to the right, the skater turns to the left, and the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they should avoid the excess energy they received from the light.
This is done by releasing a small light particle called Photon.
"Scientists call this process as ""a stimulated ejectment of radiation"" because the atoms are stimulated by clear light by issuing a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation."
The next picture shows the atoms emiting photons. Of course, the photos are much smaller than the picture.
Photons are much smaller than the substances produced by the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb will eventually burn, and then the light bulb will not work.
The light bulb needs to be changed. It is necessary to pay attention when changing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the light fix has to be turned off or the cable disconnected.
Due to the electricity flowing into the socket where the metal part of the bulb sits, the socket is partially exposed to a severe electric shock if you touch the socket or the metal part of the bulb.
The heart is the main organ of the circulatory system, which is the blood pumping.
The tubes that carry blood from the heart are called arteries, and the tubes that bring blood to the heart are called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratop could not only be broken, but also very solid branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratopes were eaten by a type of plant that was common during the Cretasius.
These plants look like a small palm tree with the crown of sharp leaves.
A tseratops may have used its strong cock to cut off its leaves before eating the stem of the tree.
While animals, such as the tewango or parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) today, other scientists argue that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely that any dinosaur can eat them.

The drawback of zoom lenses is that the focal complex city and the number of lens components needed to achieve the range of focal lengths are much higher than prime lenses.
This is not a problem because lens manufacturers have high standards in lens production.
This allows zoom lenses to produce quality images that can be compared to those taken with fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is generally low.
Inexpensive zoom lenses make it difficult to use light in low-light conditions without flash.
