Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the establishment of administrative liability for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is meant to solve the very serious issue of customers failing to fulfill their commitments as part of state and municipal procurements.
Just two years ago, situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment for already-executed state and municipal contracts were widespread.
At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control.
After all, businessmen couldn’t deal on their own with dishonest customers who signed agreements without financial backing, tried their best to get out of assumed payment commitments, and included illegal conditions in agreements.
The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.
Since 2015, 9,700 petitions, in the interests of protecting the rights of business owners to receive payment for public contracts, were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor General: according to the results of their investigations, 4,500 officials were subject to disciplinary measures, and 533 were held administratively liable; 75 cases were submitted to the investigative authorities for procedural review, and criminal proceedings were initiated in 46 of them.
In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.
Notably, these vast sums were by no means accrued as a result of non-payment of multibillion-ruble contracts.
Numerous systematic delays in payment for services to business owners for considerably more modest amounts led to these jaw-dropping debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transport services worth several million rubles.
The person invested all of their working capital, fully satisfied their commitments, but didn’t receive the allotted money when it was due.
The result is an escalating financial snowball comprised of payroll, tax, and loan liabilities, which would have led to bankruptcy if the business owner hadn’t approached the prosecutor’s office for assistance.
Now, in a number of regions, they have managed to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt related to state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In the regions where debt indicators continue to climb to critical levels, the prosecutor’s office has adopted a hands-on approach to crisis management.
The prosecutor general is personally holding on-site meetings with local officials, during which they substantively examine all of the violations uncovered by the prosecutors and the measures aimed at their immediate rectification.
This year, these types of briefing sessions have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The realization of Federal Law No. 189-FZ “On amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative liability for officials of a customer for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs”, which was signed by the Russian president last week, will qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public sector customers.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation developed the bill at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor General.
The new law will add an article to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences, which stipulates a penalty of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for violation of the deadline and procedures for payment of goods, works, or services as part of state and municipal procurements by an official of a customer.
However, if the official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then they will be suspended for a period of between one to two years.
All the prosecutors for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to enforce the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Two people have died as a result of a shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
The unidentified individuals shot at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Esna, Reuters reports with reference to Egypt’s Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed during the shooting, and three people suffered injuries.
All the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police officers stopped a vehicle, at which point the two armed individuals inside of the car opened fire on the law enforcement officials.
One of the perpetrators has been apprehended, but the second managed to escape.
The Russian Federal Tourism Agency supports the law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets
The head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBK television channel that he is “in favor” of adopting a law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets.
“We need to establish conditions whereby a person who doesn’t have baggage can purchase a cheaper ticket than a person who has baggage”, he emphasized (quoted by TASS).
In addition to this, Mr. Safonov noted that, in spite of the concerns of citizens, there would be no need to pay for outerwear or mobile phones in carry-on baggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to make an announcement about this, to say that this will have nothing to do with outerwear, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads, or even some computers”, the head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law giving airline companies the right to eliminate the free baggage allowance rule on non-refundable airline tickets.
The point of the issue is that airline companies are free to determine the number of seats and weight of baggage at the non-refundable rate.
Vladimir Putin has ordered the cleanup of pollution in Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting concerning the protection of Baikal, reported that, over the past several years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme contamination.
He instructed that sources of financing, plans, and those responsible for implementing the cleanup of the pollution be identified.
Mr. Putin also ordered that a full-fledged reclamation of polluted areas be conducted.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to operate here; the sewage treatment plants, the majority of them are worn-out”, RIA Novosti quotes the president as saying.
He also added that the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation should conduct an inquiry to identify environmentally destructive activities.
According to him, there are problems connected to illegal dumping and a range of environmental violations by recreation operators in the area around the lake.
“I would like to emphasize this: there’s no need to inspect everything in sight – we also need to know where to draw the line – but specifically illegal and environmentally destructive activities and then take appropriate measures”, he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
You will recall that on June 15, during the direct line, Vladimir Putin spoke about the necessity of changing legislation to ensure the protection of the rights of citizens living in natural areas under the special protection regime.
Residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, let him know about problems with conducting business activities.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoi, immediately offered to solve the problem by amending the borders of Lake Baikal’s water protection zone, but the Government of Buryatia reminded that such a change would be insufficient given that the restrictions are tied to a whole range of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Development proposed solving the problem by amending the land code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new church in Yurga
In the village of Sosva, members of the Rakhtynya community of indigenous peoples of the North, along with residents of Berezovsky District, will take part in the construction of an orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location will be on the riverbank: the church will be easily visible from far away, so it will serve as a steering landmark for fishermen.
According to members of the community, construction work will already be completed this year: so far the dome has been installed, and the church bell is on hand.
The Igrimsk Fleet Repair and Operational Base provided transport services.
The church was named in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, since the Orthodox Church venerates him as the patron of travellers, including fishermen.
After all, in Sosva, the fishing industry provides settlers with work and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the day the church opens its doors, and children are even writing school compositions about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws obeyed in Singapore?
I am talking with a local businessman, Chang, while sitting in an open-air eatery.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully placing the butts into a small iron box he brought with him from the office.
After finishing our conversation, the businessman heads toward the nearest trashcan (it’s about 100 meters away) and dumps the butts into it.
The fine for littering in public places is 500 local dollars, Chang says.
You know, it’s a simple reflex I developed in my childhood: it’s forbidden to throw a candy wrapper onto the pavement; they will fine you instantly.
Nowadays, the fact is, there are cameras everywhere.
And it’s true: the sidewalks in downtown Singapore are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says that, three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son wrote graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and he was sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Just imagine.
He received ten lashings with a wooden cane to his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
Here, in general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
AiF’s staff writer understood, right then and there, how exceptionally high living standards and unbelievably harsh laws go together in Singapore.
Here, no one is concerned with abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government stopped caring a long time ago about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person smuggles in a large shipment of drugs or sells them, then they are sent to the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 g of cocaine on him.
The Australian prime minister (threatening sanctions), international human rights advocates, and even the Pope came to his defense.
Nevertheless, the boy still ended up being hanged.
Since then, drug traffickers carefully bypass our country.
Here’s the deal: in Singapore, the rule is that absolutely EVERYONE must obey the laws, not just simple people and those of modest means.
It doesn’t matter who you are: a millionaire, the vice prime minister, a famous actor, or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one outcome in the given situation: if they find half a kilo of cocaine on you, then you will be hanged.
When you’re walking around Singapore and come across signs with lots of warnings everywhere, you’re simply astonished by just how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is only sold in pharmacies, and it can only by bought with a doctor’s prescription!
They won’t confiscate a tourist’s gum upon arrival, but should you stick your gum in the metro, they will slap you with a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In the span of four days, I ran into two people with white signs around their necks that said, “I littered”.
For cigarette butts tossed beside a garbage can, in addition to a fine, they often impose a sentence of “grounds cleaning exile”: cleaning parks and beaches for a week.
A “criminal” who forgets to flush a public toilet after themselves pays 6,000 rubles, while a special detector is activated in the event of an attempt to relieve oneself in the elevator of a residential apartment building: the doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Some of the most unusual laws include: bans on feeding pigeons in the street, singing songs in public, and even overwatering indoor plants (it is believed that an abundance of water attracts mosquitos)!
To prevent fires, smokers are forbidden from bringing lighters into the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Basically, you get the feeling that no matter how hard you try, you will inevitably break something.
That’s far from the case, says Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, in an attempt to change my mind.
The particularly absurd laws only exist on paper, and over the past twenty years, I haven’t seen anyone be charged for breaking them.
Then why do they remain in place?
So that citizens don’t become complacent.
Compliance with the fundamental rules is rigorously monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes at a kiosk, then everyone down the line will be punished: the storeowner will pay a huge fine, the actual offender will receive a caning to their “backside”, and the salesperson will also be given a thrashing and put in jail.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that crime is very rare in Singapore.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads: motorists ignored traffic lights, drove however they wanted, and got behind the wheel drunk.
After the introduction of fines, everything calmed down within a year.
Nowadays, a driver, having drunk a jigger of whiskey, knows that if they are pulled over, the police officer won’t let them go for a bribe; they will impose a fine in an amount equivalent to the cost of an apartment and will put them behind bars for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a type of detention camp.
In 1993, the American writer, William Gibson, dubbed Singapore, “Disneyland with the death penalty”: the visitor from the United States was terrified by the universal wealth of residents, the “frighteningly clean airport”, and the “cultivated nature”.
He purported that such things are unnatural, appear artificial, and that, as a matter of principle, just shouldn’t be.
The first few days in Singapore, you truly fear tossing a piece of paper onto the sidewalk, and change your mind if you’ve entered the metro with ice cream.
But then you arrive in the “Little India” district and, suddenly, “the mold is broken”: plastic cups lay strewn across a bus stop.
“But how can it be?” you ask in astonishment.
“It just is”, Singaporeans say with a smile.
Anything can happen.
They don’t nab you on the spot for every such “crime”; however, you should know that if they track you down, you won’t be able to talk your way out of it, after all, you broke the law.
More often than not, this is enough to ensure that a person behaves properly.
It goes without saying that the government in Singapore is pretty much authoritarian.
But, you know what?
I walked around in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City very cautiously: motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras right out of tourists’ hands.
The center of Paris is full of dirty transients and panhandlers.
Not everyone tries to throw their garbage into the cans on our streets either.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless laws (right up to the death penalty), has become the calmest, cleanest, and safest city in the world.
It makes you think.
It’s just human nature: remember, no one buckled-up behind the wheel in Russia either, until they started to issue fines.
Nevertheless, the most important thing in Singapore isn’t the fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And chances are that people here, in Russia, would also be delighted with clean streets, an absence of litter in the metro, and would support the arrest of those who mistake the elevator for a public toilet.
As far as corporal punishment goes: thanks, but no thanks.
As for the rest of Singapore’s laws, at the very least, it’s worth taking a closer look at them.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels above the freeway, capable of absorbing the carbon monoxide emitted by automobiles, are already being tested on the roads in Great Britain.
The country’s transportation agency, as the Autocar publication reports, has reported positive results from the trial run of the 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel was built from some of the latest polymer materials, which are capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
However, establishing an entire network of similar tunnels is just a part of the extensive measures that the government of Great Britain is planning to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to a network of tunnels, the English plan to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a series of measures to reduce the flow of traffic on roads, expand the use of electric-powered commercial vehicles, and modernize the stock of heavy-duty trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to traffic, and poor air quality accounts for up to 40,000 premature deaths each year.
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled man, Aton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine in the amount of 200,000 rubles.
TASS reports about this.
Previously, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to change the prison term to a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment, to be served in a standard regime penal colony, for a robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an off-site session in the pretrial detention facility.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
Growth in the flow of tourists in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
According to the figures, which a correspondent for the rus.err.ee website received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, at total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists made use of the services of hotel facilities in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than for the same period a year ago.
Moreover, the number of local tourists declined, while the number of foreign tourists grew.
Thus, in June, the flow of foreign tourists increased by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
Meanwhile, the number of local tourists declined by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
Most notably, the number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9% or by 318 people as compared to June 2016.
In June 2017 alone, 3,885 visitors from Russia spent the night in the hotels of Ida-Virumaa.
Andrey Malakhov has indicated to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov dropped a hint for his fans on Instagram about who is to blame for his departure from First Channel.
Until now, he hasn’t commented on the rumors, but today he posted an excerpt from an article in the newspaper Vedomosti from August 1.
Malakhov captioned the picture with the tag: “baby boss”.
The article was about how to prevent employee “burnout” and pay attention to their state of being.
If we recall the numerous reports about the host not being able to find common ground with the recently arrived producer, who set out to reformat “Let Them Talk”, it becomes clear what he was dropping such strong hints about, KP writes.
It has been reported that television host Andrey Malakhov is currently on leave and hasn’t signed a letter of resignation from First Channel.
The situation surrounding the termination could become clear in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed by a car bomb in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in a bombing in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, the other night a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk District.
We are aware of 20 fatalities.
A new incident occurred in Girishk on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The shootout between the attackers and security forces continues.
A diver has recorded a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The clip was posted to Facebook by a division of the American Agency for Marine Fisheries in the state of Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2, off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn website clarifies.
During the dive, the man tried to record the shark on camera, which was attached to a special stick.
Having noticed the human, the animal, with a length of more than three meters, swam up to him.
The shark proceeded to bite the camera, but didn’t try to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could have easily destroyed the device.
He also noted that this type of behavior in marine animals was something new to scientists.
The cause of a massive fight at the Ural Military Center has been revealed
A work group of senior officers from the Central Military District has arrived at the Yelansky Training Center, where a massive fight occurred, in order to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details about this brawl have been revealed already.
According to the Mash public page, which appeared on the VKontakte site, contract soldiers from Ural Military Unit No. 31612 got into a brutal fight over an untucked bed.
It all started when a soldier by the name of Sayan deliberately ignored an officer’s order to tuck in a protruding bed sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company sided with the officer.
The first company supported Sayan.
In the span of a half hour, the 140 young men trashed the beds and sinks in the barracks and smashed glass.
More than ten people were injured in the massive fight.
The Central Military District refuted information about a stabbing.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
The Congress of the IAAF has extended the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF).
As such, the congress supported the IAAF Council (which released a report on Monday that recommended keeping the suspension in place) concerning the reinstatement of the ARAF.
166 people voted to extend the suspension, with 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report mentions that the ARAF has made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the council for reinstating membership, but that these conditions still have not been entirely met.
On account of the ban against the ARAF, Russian track and field athletes were forced to compete at the World Championships in London under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 people who were cleared for competition by the IAAF.
The ARAF was subjected to an indefinite ban from the IAAF in 2015.
At that time, a report was published by Dick Pound, an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more on the latest IAAF Council report, read the Kommersant article: “The IAAF has extended sanctions against the ARAF”.
A bitter defeat
Khimik Novomoskovsk played an away game against FC Kaluga as part of the 3rd round of the FONBET Russian Championship between teams of the Premier Football League.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played against each other in the Russia Cup, this time, however, the look of the game was decidedly different.
Khimik was in no way inferior to its opponent, but a moment of inattentiveness at the end of the match led to the bitter goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat at the hands of the Kalugans, with a score of 0-3, many predicted in advance an easy win for the home team.
However, from the start of the game, the Novomoskovsk players were a force to be reckoned with and played a defensive game, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the Kalugans were more active and had the advantage in terms of possession of the ball.
Aleksei Sirotin, who deflected several dangerous shots and gave his teammates confidence with his performance, had another very good match.
Unfortunately, Khimik’s offensive game didn’t have enough force and luck to stymie Kaluga’s defense and score the first goal of the away game.
After the half time interval, the game turned into an offensive slugfest.
The Novomoskovsk players started playing more actively on the attack.
The death knell for our team turned out to be defensive mistakes that enabled the Kalugans to make a series of critical plays.
Just 10 minutes before the end of the match, Khimik regained territorial advantage and conducted several risky attacks.
But the experience of the Kalugans played its role: they finished off the last minutes with more skill and composure, waiting for their chance to score.
Following a dangerous attack, Khimik moved the ball to corner area, which the home team kicked into the net without opposition.
Yury Dubrovin was the goal scorer.
In the current match, Khimik played a pretty good game, but suffered a bitter defeat.
There is still another away game coming up for our team: on August 11 at 7 p.m. in Moscow at the Eduard Streltsov “Torpedo” Stadium, the Novomoskovsk players will take on the favorites of the Center Group, FC Ararat, whose lineup includes, Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Aleksei Rebko.
Come out and support Khimik!
The time and meeting place for Novomoskovsk fans is 6:30 p.m. outside of the Magnolia store (2 Vostochnaya, Building.
The Khimik lineup: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
The bodies of the tourists who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Saint Petersburg
The plane belonging to Rossiya airline company, on board of which are the bodies of the Russian nationals who died in Abkhazia, took off from Sochi en route to Saint Petersburg at 8:15 p.m. (Moscow Time), TASS reports.
Staff from the funeral agency and representatives from the mayor’s office will meet the flight at its final destination point, said Abkhazia’s deputy minister for resorts and tourism, Astamyr Akhba.
Earlier, representatives for the republic’s EMERCON announced that the government of Abkhazia has taken it upon itself to cover all expenses associated with delivering the bodies back to Russia.
Furthermore, Sukhumi intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Akhba, Abkhazia’s leadership expressed their willingness to pay for the flights and accommodation in the republic for the relatives of the tourists who were killed as a result of the explosions; however, the relatives only sent to the republic the power of attorney for local authorities to act in accordance with established procedure.
On August 2, at approximately 4:20 p.m. (Moscow Time), two explosions went off at a missile and artillery depot of the republic’s Ministry of Defense in the village of Primorskoye in Gudautsky District, after which the large caliber shells and other munitions stored there started to detonate.
A fire broke out at the depot as a result of this, which triggered the uncontrolled explosions of various types of shells.
Two Russian citizens were killed as a result of the accident, Yelena Polyakova (born in 1970) and Yelena Timofeeva (born in 1962), who were vacationing nearby the hydrosulfuric spring.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity, were sent to the republic’s medical facilities.
Currently, seven people remain in hospital and the rest have been released.
A grand jury will be involved in investigating Russian influence in the US election
The special prosecutor on Russia, Robert Mueller, has convened a grand jury in Washington that will investigate Russia’s influence on the US presidential election in 2016, the Wall Street Journal newspaper and Reuters news agency report.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens that collects evidence of possible criminal offenses and has the right to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the collected material and will decide if it is sufficient to file charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimonial evidence.
One of the topics of inquiry for the panel of jurors, which started working several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then presidential candidate, Donald Trump, with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself already promised to verify the details of this meeting held in June 2016.
They have already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his team of lawyers.
Previously, Trump Jr. said that he was expecting to get dirt on the headquarters of the Democratic Party’s candidate, Hillary Clinton, but that no such incriminating documents were presented, and the conversation ended up being about adoption.
At the beginning of August, information appeared in some media sources that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was practically dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House made it clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply exercised his authority, as any father would do.
The Deputy Mayor of Penza was detained in the workplace
The deputy head of the administration for Penza, Irina Shirshina, was detained for 48 hours at her place of work by order of the Investigative Committee, RIA Novosti reports.
Official announcements from law enforcement agencies concerning this matter haven’t come in yet, but the press service for the Criminal Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee has assured that they will soon follow.
The mayor’s office for Penza has not yet commented on what has happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of administration for Penza.
She was responsible for issues of city planning and land matters, having held this position since April 2015.
Prior to this, she worked for a long time as the department head of the State Inspectorate for Housing and Construction for Penza Oblast.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, and it is significant to note that, after becoming a mother once again a year ago, she chose not to take maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is neither a spaceport, nor launch vehicles in Mexico.
However, there is a space agency, established in 2010, and a desire to develop their own space program.
And the installation of a bust of Yuri Gagarin: this is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments that are being torn down in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, are “spreading across the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in the American city of Houston, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument was erected on the grounds of the Royal Observatory, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany, in the city of Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992, thanks to public protests, and was relocated from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the given name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and he looks as though he has reached the age of 70.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
A court has fined Navalny for violations at a “campaign subbotnik”
Moscow’s Simonovsky Court has fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The opposition figure was found guilty of committing an administrative offence specified in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, “Repeat violation of the procedure for organizing a rally”.
Earlier, the judge for Moscow’s Simonovsky Court, Khizir Mussakaev, finished hearing the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, head of the main office for the opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who was held liable under the very same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine in the amount of 300,000 rubles.
This is the amount that Judge Mussakaev assessed for the distribution of leaflets at a “campaign subbotnik” that Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the propaganda materials, the police officers monitoring participants at the “campaign subbotnik” believed that the organizers had deliberately concealed its real purpose: a public protest (which requires advance permission from the capital’s authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, petitioned for a termination of the administrative proceedings, due to an absence of concrete evidence of an offense, and pointed to the fact that the police made specific mistakes when preparing the report.
Volkov wasn’t detained at the actual “campaign subbotnik”, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to give a statement about the event, which was held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition figure, Nikolai Lyaskin, also received summons.
In Mordovia, a man who shot a bride and three wedding guests has been arrested
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including the bride.
The republic’s directorate of the Investigative Committee reported this.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During a dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at the event’s guests, who had gone to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were wounded as a result.
Criminal charges have been filed under paragraph “a” of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Hooliganism), part 3 of Article 30, and paragraphs “a”, “f”, and “i” of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Attempted murder of two or more persons, committed using a generally dangerous method, based on malicious motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man started shooting because the wedding guests, having decided to go swimming, walked through his territory on their way to the pond.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for electric power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for reporting information for suppliers of critically important equipment, in particular, turbines for electric power plants.
When launching gas turbines, turbines for hydroelectric plants, and oil pumping and extraction facilities, equipment suppliers will be obligated to share information about access to them with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technology and Export Control.
The government draft decree is already ready and has been submitted for public consultation.
The new requirements will only apply to “critically important energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats named in the document include incidents such as foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unprincipled partners, and hackers gaining information about and access to control over facilities.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions on account of Siemens
On August 4, the European Union’s press service announced that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded because of a scandal surrounding the delivery of turbines manufactured by Siemens to Crimea.
Argumenty Nedeli previously reported on this.
The press service of the EU Council announced that sanctions against Russia were expanded because of a scandal over turbines manufactured by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in contravention of the sanctions.
Today, the European Council is considering all possible complaints and suggestions by member states concerning the expansion of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier, it was reported that a final decision would be made by the end of the day, and a decision has been made: sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
The Association of European Businesses has come out against the new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses has expressed its opposition to the United States’ economic sanctions against Russia.
In the opinion of the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious decline in production and a loss of jobs.
The announcement from the AEB states that business is one of the most important links connecting countries and peoples, and it is for this reason that the principles of free trade must not be restricted.
The Association of European Businesses unites more than 500 companies from European Union countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, US, and Russia to develop a new course of action, which would make it possible to separate business from politics and find collective and mutually acceptable solutions in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies are asking the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov
The chosen representatives of the people in Pskov issued a request to the chief of the city’s regional office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Sergei Surin, regarding the issue of traffic along the waterfront of the Velikaya River.
City duma deputies, Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov, and Valery Lesnikov, believe that motorists hinder people from taking walks and relaxing in this area.
In their view, monitoring drivers will help make this area more peaceful and safe.
The issue is that offenders are ignoring “pedestrian crossing” signs and driving around the waterfront without restriction.
It turns out that extensive repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
The sports areas and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable due to the cars.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, members of the Patrol and Checkpoint Service and neighborhood watch volunteers are patrolling the central waterfront in the evenings.
Thanks to them, the number of vehicles passing through is declining, but not all the traffic is going away.
Putin has demanded investigative agencies not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed prohibiting investigative agencies from seizing servers and hard drives from work computers within businesses.
The head of state announced this at a meeting about the investment development program for the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to “eliminate the use of investigative measures that result in business interruption, including the seizure of hard drives from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to make copies, authenticate them, and use them during the course of the investigation”.
The head of state added that one must not “create conditions that prevent an enterprise from continuing its activities, to the extent of not being able to pay taxes”.
Olga Buzova spoke about how badly she wanted to call her ex-husband
Television host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband, the football player Dmitri Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he is dealing with work issues.
Just the other day, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social media platform, Instagram.
She stated that she hadn’t gotten married, hadn’t gotten any new tattoos, and also hadn’t repeatedly called her ex-spouse to tell him that he had ruined her life, even though she had really wanted to do this.
Buzova stated that she would remember this trip forever, since she had had such a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
The British actor, Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the series of novels about Harry Potter, has passed away in his 92nd year of life.
The Independent newspaper reported this on Thursday.
His relatives spoke about his death.
In their words, he lived “a tremendous life, achieving success in film, theater, and television over a 70-year career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he acted alongside Laurence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in “The Tragedy of Coriolanus”.
Hardy is also remembered for his multiple performances as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the film adaptations of Agatha Christie’s works about Miss Marple.
He was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for his performance in the same role of Churchill in the BBC television drama series, “Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years” (1981).
Robert Hardy also had the chance to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on more than one occasion.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark: Prince Henrik, or in actual fact, Henri Marie Jean André Graf of Laborde, has refused to be buried together with his crowned spouse, Queen Margrethe.
This year is the couple’s “golden” wedding anniversary; however, the order of the day isn’t preparations for the celebration, but rather a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and also made stinging remarks in the queen’s address about her never getting around to granting him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France even though he remains the queen’s official spouse.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged Washington to stop defaming Moscow
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has addressed the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The foreign ministry circulated the corresponding statement a short while ago.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in its commentary that the United States is ever more actively making use of Cold War clichés, which are totally out of touch with the current reality.
Moreover, Russian diplomats urged the American authorities to stop defaming the Russian Federation.
As Argumenty Nedeli wrote the other day, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the western Balkans and organizing an unsuccessful coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Several central roads in Moscow will be closed to traffic over the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic in the capital will be restricted in the area of Tverskaya Street between Nastasinsky Lane and Triumphal Square; traffic will also be restricted along 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition to this, Leningradsky Prospekt will be closed to traffic from the Third Ring Road to 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
Closures in all of these areas will apply to traffic in both directions, reports the information center for Moscow’s Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 until 5 a.m. on August 7, in connection with their improvement.
A section of Moskvoretskaya Embankment will also be closed to traffic on the weekend.
Construction of Zaryadye Park is still underway there.
Putin has instructed the Office of the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of Baikal territory for evidence of illegal and environmentally destructive activities.
“I am requesting the Office of the Prosecutor General to check Baikal territory for evidence of illegal and environmentally destructive activities”, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting dedicated to environmental development of the region.
Furthermore, the Russian leader asked that measures be taken if evidence of violations is found.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
I’ll think about whether to run for the presidency
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin stated that he is ready to think about whether to run for the Russian presidency in the 2018 election, Interfax reports.
This statement was in response to a request from a resident of the village of Cheremushka in Buryatia.
During a videoconference dedicated to fighting the fires in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast, the interlocutor turned to Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you; when the next presidential election takes place, we all ask that you run for this position again”.
“Fine, I will think about it, thank you”, the president said in response.
On July 28, the president’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the statements of certain media outlets that the Russian president’s chief of staff, Aton Vaino, would be in charge of Vladimir Putin’s campaign headquarters.
Peskov called these suppositions “groundless, hypothetical speculation”.
“So far there is no headquarters: it will be quite some time before a headquarters is established and the election campaign is still a long way off”, Peskov said.
“It’s not on the agenda yet”, Peskov stated.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
A heavyweight cat that goes by the nickname of Mr. Handsome has found a home thanks to social media
A shelter in the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, United States) has placed a cat by the name of Mr. Handsome, weighing more than 14 kilograms, after he became famous thanks to the internet.
Mashable reports about this.
At the end of June, a picture of the cat, with a request to find his owner, was published on the shelter’s Facebook account, because “it’s clear someone used to feed him”.
In the comments, users noted that the expression on the animal’s face could become a new meme.
The post garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take in Mr. Handsome.
In the end, he was placed in the care of Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio station, the American woman said that she already had a similar experience: she brought home a cat weighing 10 kilograms and now he weighs just a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users took notice of a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a picture of the animal garnered more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could very well make a career for herself in the modeling business.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
A court has placed a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason under arrest
Journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been placed under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
The employee of the online media outlet, Zhitomir Journal, is suspected of treason on the basis of posting his publications on Russian websites and of violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
That being said, Russia does not support the actions of Ukrainian authorities in relation to the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya’s territorial waters so as to then stop the flow of illegal migrants in cooperation with that country’s navy.
The decision to start the operation was approved by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome obtained approval for it from the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, it must be said, is not in control of a large part of the country’s territory.
The Libyan parliament based in Tobruk, which is in opposition to the cabinet, accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
While the commander-in-chief of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to repel the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was announced that they do not believe these threats and intend to deploy yet another naval vessel to Libya’s territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week during negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the Cabinet of Libya, which is recognized by Europe.
Italian authorities settled on establishing a naval mission to combat illegal migration in July, when statistics for the number of illegals who have sailed to the country from Libya were made public: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government announced that resources for the settlement of migrants have been depleted.
A major glitch has occurred with Skype
Today, a worldwide glitch in Skype service was recorded at the same time in several countries.
On Thursday, August 3, users started to send complaints en masse to the program developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to fix the problems that residents of Europe and North America were facing, clarifies RIA Novosti.
You will recall that, in June of this year, a glitch also occurred with Skype.
For a period of time, users were unable to receive or send messages.
Two Team Ukraine leaders in track and field were suspended from participating in the World Championships
Olga Zemlyak and Olesia Povkh, who specialize in sprinting, were excluded from the Team Ukraine roster for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the country’s athletics federation (UAF).
This decision was made by the organization’s executive committee in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the track athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Zemlyak’s coach, Sergey Basenko, was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation’s roster.
As Sportarena reports, the IAAF suspects the female athletes of doping.
Povkh was a bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics, world champion in 2011, and European champion in 2010 in the 4x100m relay; Zemlyak won the 2012 European championship in the 4x400m relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4-13.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
The president will determine the procedure and location of the oath-taking ceremony
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president: the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation has prepared such amendments to the second reading of the corresponding law.
Just a week ago, deputies were planning to directly determine the procedure for the oath-swearing ceremony in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as the legally incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, it appears from a revised text of amendments to the proposed law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” (Izvestia has a copy at its disposal), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of establishing an oath of allegiance when becoming a citizen of the Russian Federation, in lieu of the formal signing of documents, during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on June 6.
Deputies put this idea into action through amendments to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the reversal of a decision to grant citizenship to those who are later convicted of a range of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for publicly calling for terrorist activity or for publicly justifying them in the media or on the internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for high-jacking an aircraft, train, or waterborne vessel, but only in the event this act is related to terrorism (part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was as follows: when filling out citizenship forms, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian laws, and by going down an extremist path, they are breaking that promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhironovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (A Just Russia), and by the speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, deputies approved it in its first reading.
The following week, the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for its second reading; however, it has now been revised once again.
Currently, it reads that the president will determine the procedure of the oath-taking ceremony.
Previously, parliamentarians were going to define the procedures for the law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” themselves, specifying that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere, in front of the state emblem and the Russian flag, and in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was unclear from the text of the bill where this ceremony should take place: there is list of places where it is possible to place the emblem of the Russian Federation, which is regulated according to federal constitutional law.
Included on this list are: courthouses, the offices of heads of state bodies for the constituent entities and municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal agencies of executive authority, and so forth.
In all likelihood, it could even be the civil registry offices.
Those wishing to receive Russian citizenship will swear the solemn oath after officials examine their documents.
However, it appears from the revised text that an individual will only receive a Russian passport after they have taken the oath.
A week ago, the draft mentioned that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
In the updated text, it mentions that swearing allegiance to Russia will be for those 18 years of age and older, rather than starting at 14 years of age.
The rule, according to which the legally incapacitated or partially incapacitated, as well as those who are unable to say, read, or independently sign the text of the oath, are exempt from taking the oath, was retained.
Additionally, the Russian president has the right to exempt “other persons” from this procedure.
The updated bill also spells out the specific procedure for granting Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine who are regarded as native speakers of Russian.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by presenting the relevant application form for this to the authorized Ukrainian authority.
A notarized copy of the application form will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A renouncement of “foreign” citizenship, as is the case right now, is not required if it is provided for by international agreement or if it is not possible “due to factors beyond the control of the individual”.
The respective amendment to the law was suggested by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov, and Ayrat Farrakhov (all from United Russia).
I think that many of us know that getting an official document from Ukraine is unrealistic and just not possible.
As such, a whole lot of people are awaiting a decision on their fate in terms of Russian citizenship, the head of the Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation, Pavel Krasheninnikov (UR), explained the other day.
In addition to this, a clarification appeared in the text stating that the restriction on foreigners holding certain positions will not apply to those who have renounced their “other” citizenship in writing and have surrendered their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of the Interior, but have not ceased being a citizen of another country “due to factors beyond their control”.
Currently, foreigners are prohibited from holding a position in the municipal service or being employed at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring Russia’s security.
Furthermore, a person with dual citizenship or permanent residency in another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is anticipated that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, and the requisite subordinate regulatory acts must be ready by that time.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
The prize money for the Russian Football Super Cup match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will amount to about 30 million rubles.
The president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL), Sergey Pryadkin, announced this at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that, by now, there are hardly any tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14 at 9:30 p.m.
As noted by TASS, Spartak is the current Russian champion, while Lokomotiv holds the country’s Cup title.
Two young residents of Ufa fleeced a furniture workshop of 200,000 rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture business, contacted the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which dealt a serious blow to his business.
The young thieves’ loot consisted of tools worth a total of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding units, a perforating machine, a hydraulic system, and a lift.
Law enforcement officers set out in search of the criminals and, shortly thereafter, found the residents of Bashkortostan’s Blagoveshchensky District: 23-year-old and 24-year-old buddies.
According to the press service for the republic’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, the criminal associates entered the grounds of the business, forced open the front door, and carried out the tools.
Immediately after this, the young men sold the stolen equipment to the first available auto service center.
A criminal case for theft has already been initiated against them, while law enforcement officers were able to return just some of the stolen tools to their rightful owner.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s remarks on Russia-US relations
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was delivered by the State Department’s official spokesperson, Heather Nauert, in response to the remarks of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to hopes for an improvement in bilateral relations and had declared a full-fledged trade war against Russia.
Commenting on these remarks, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low point”, however, she noted that it was necessary to look for “areas for cooperation”.
“Take a look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has held firm for almost a month already”.
“This is an example of good US-Russian cooperation”, RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat as saying.
That being said, the spokesperson for the foreign policy establishment declined to comment on the Russian prime minister’s statement equating the sanctions to a trade war.
A bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK, was signed by US President Donald Trump this past Wednesday.
However, he acknowledged that the document was flawed and contradicted the American Constitution.
Dior has “grown” roses made of amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior – Dior Joaillerie – has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
Five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons have been added to them.
Two new rings and a pendant made from amethysts, rose quartz, and diamonds, created using glyptic (engraving of gemstones by hand) and pavé setting techniques, were released in the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line to mark the house’s 70th anniversary.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses that fashion designer Christian Dior grew at his estate in Granville and by the Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan gardens in Paris.
Trump has found the culprits behind deteriorating relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump lashed out at members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress: the same people that can’t even give us healthcare”, the president wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
They, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House released a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law would prevent the US from concluding lucrative deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea even closer together.
A Belorussian entrepreneur has backed out of buying Sberbank’s Ukrainian subsidiary
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Viktor Prokopenya, has withdrawn a bid from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBK as an intention “to concentrate on our other planned investments and projects we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopenya, this move will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the Sberbank subsidiary acquisition.
Mr. Prokopenya became the prime contender for the buy-out of the division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU declined a consortium bid by Grigory Guselnikov’s NorvikBank and Said Gutseriev’s Belorussian company in July.
Russian banks started to abandon the Ukrainian market after the country’s president, Petro Poroshenko, introduced sanctions against their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank, was Sberbank.
Novak has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Ministry of Energy has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the government agency, Alexander Novak, offered clarification concerning the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity as a result of a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
A truck involved in the accident hit power lines, which led to an outage of the Kuban and connected Crimean power grids.
Power failures were reported in major cities in Crimea last week.
Technicians fixed the problems over the course of a few hours.
At first, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been a heat wave.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The World Congress of Tatars has adopted a resolution to support the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) has adopted a resolution that notes the importance of retaining the post of the president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post “has proven to be a positive form for organizing the highest state authority in the republic and expressing the national interests of all Tatar people”.
Furthermore, the congress emphasized the importance of the power-sharing treaty between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, it “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic, and socio-political development of both Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
To recap, the treaty between Moscow and Kazan, in force since July 24, 2007, was signed for a period of 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan approached the president of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the name of the position of the head of the region.
Currently, Tatarstan is the only constituent entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post that goes by the name of “president”.
Difficulties have arisen with obtaining international driving permits in Russia
State Traffic Safety Inspectorate departments are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDP).
To get such permits, one must wait their turn for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to go on holiday abroad using their car or rent one there.
It’s worth mentioning that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced so that it would be easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national permit, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international driving permits are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian permits are recognized already.
However, in actual fact, everything depends on specific police officers or the rental agency: some require the IDP, while a national permit is enough for others.
To be on the safe side, drivers still get international permits, but it should be kept in mind that in countries that haven’t ratified the convention, for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Indonesia, the authorities have the right to refuse both national permits and the IDP.
Currently, there is a problem with the forms at almost every department of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate, Kommersant reports, after conducting an investigation in several regions.
For example, at departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate in Moscow, they have simply stopped handing out tickets and there has been a shortage of forms for four months already.
It’s possible to register for an appointment on the state services website, but the waitlist on there already extends into the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the IDP “due to technical reasons”, without going into details; in Samara Oblast, to be honest, there are no forms, and it’s a similar situation in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already been faced with this issue; messages like this are popping up with increasing frequency on social media:
Irina Burmistrova: “Take a guess, why you can’t get an international permit in Moscow?”
That’s right, because all of the departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: “A question for people in the know!”
I need to get an international permit as soon as possible.
In Moscow, everything is always booked up so far in advance, and they aren’t issuing tickets on-site (there is a button, but it can’t issue a ticket).
Apparently, the state service website shows that there are lots of appointments available in Saint Petersburg.
Has anyone tried to get one in a different city?
Do you think it will work?
The Russian Ministry of the Interior explained that the requirements for the international driving permit forms have changed, and that the delivery of new forms to departments of the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate is currently underway.
This might be related to the shortage, however, it’s unclear what changes they are talking about, since nothing was announced previously.
The forms are purchased by the Special Designation Center for Traffic Safety (SDCTS) of the Russian Ministry of the Interior, and then they are distributed to departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate.
Over the past few years, all contracts were signed with JSC Goznak: between 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced; in 2016, 15,000 forms were purchased; in 2017 – 90,000; but, the most recent contract was signed on July 18 with OOO First Print Yard to produce 70,000 forms.
One explanation is that the SDC didn’t hold the tender in time, which resulted in the shortage.
However, there are also other explanations for the scarcity of forms: on account of the crisis, people, of their own volition, have started to travel not to Europe, but to less expensive Asian countries like China, Thailand, and so on.
It is still unclear what types of permits are accepted there, so people are covering all their bases, and that is why there has been overwhelming demand for the international “papers”.
Recently, it came to light that professional drivers will have to pass a test to verify their skills.
The Ministry of Transport came up with this proposal.
The new version of the international driver’s permit (IDP) has been in use since May 31, 2011.
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea Bridge
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he doesn’t believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview on the Obozrevatel website.
Not a single self-respecting international company would put even a tiny bolt or nut in there, because they would risk losing their business in the EU, USA, Japan – the countries that joined in sanctions against Russia in relation to Crimea.
“In other words, it is my profound belief that this project essentially has no future”, Petrenko declared.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing the large-scale infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can’t even properly build smaller-scale projects.
I know that, following the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums were already starting to crumble.
“Therefore, I consider the best instrument in this situation to be sanctions against companies who turned out to be shortsighted enough to join this project”, the official noted.
On July 31, construction workers finished installing the vehicle arch of the Crimea Bridge.
On the Kerch shore, preassembly of the road transport arch of the Crimea Bridge has been completed: its arch is capped at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
“At the same time, bridge builders prepared to install the fairway supports for the railway arch”, the project’s information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that construction on the project was ahead of schedule.
The Crimea Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
An official who didn’t go to work for 10 years was fired in Spain
What kind of angelic patience (or utter indifference to public service) did the boss of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have to possess?
The permanent absence spanned a long 10 years.
Admittedly, Mr. Recio had been fired after all.
But not by his direct supervisor.
What doesn’t happen in the world of bureaucracy?
Ordinary people, it seems, have long become accustomed to all the antics of the “servants of the people”.
But, nevertheless, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live quite well.
This time the “sensation” hails from Spain.
There, an employee at the Valencia archives, Carlos Recio, managed to not go to work for an entire ten years.
That being said, he still received his salary regularly.
Moreover, it was entirely respectable: 50,000 euros a year.
And then, the “wonderful times” of Mr. Recio came to an end.
He was fired according to a decision by Valencia’s legislative assembly.
During the course of the investigation, it emerged that the notorious absentee went to the office every workday morning at 7:00 a.m., in order to clock in on the electronic system.
And then, he immediately left for home.
He showed up at the workplace again at 4:00 p.m., in order to once again register in the system that he had left.
And so it continued for 10 years.
It also came to light that the absentee dedicated all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now, the deputies of Valencia’s legislative assembly are also considering how to punish Mr. Recio’s direct supervisor, who couldn’t have not known how his subordinate was “actively working” at his job.
They’re proposing to protect judges from chairpersons
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC), under instructions from Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The HRC proposes limiting the powers of court chairpersons and introducing appointment by election for them.
For appeal and cassation courts, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative territorial divisions of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals as part of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has finished developing the proposals, which will make it possible to strengthen the independence of the Russian system of justice.
The HRC conducted this work in accordance with an order by Vladimir Putin from January 3, 2017, which the president issued after a meeting with members of the council.
Individual cases of abuse of judicial power, as well as issues with public oversight of places of imprisonment, were discussed at the meeting with council members on December 8, 2016 (see Kommersant from December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, which are concerned both with issues of ensuring judicial independence and uncovering miscarriages of justice, as well as with funding for courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders involves limiting the powers of court chairpersons to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a judicial candidate has successfully completed the selection process and has received the support of the community of judges, then the court chairperson, in the opinion of the HRC, ought to submit their nomination without having the right to refuse, as the law currently allows.
It is also proposed to strip the court chairperson of the right to divide a case under consideration between judges.
Experts suggest that a specially written computer program can do this.
The HRC also believes that the court chairperson shouldn’t have the right “to predetermine the results of a judge’s performance report, initiate disciplinary actions against them, or make decisions about the establishment of additional monetary payments”.
In addition to this, the presidential council considers it essential to move to “the election of court chairpersons by judges themselves” and “confer their powers for a relatively short term with mandatory rotation”.
Currently, all court chairpersons (from the republic courts right down to the district courts) are appointed by the president for six years, upon the recommendation of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to shield judges from pressure by regional administrations, the HRC suggests organizing appeal and cassations courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Currently, their structure is tied to the administrative territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The HRC says “it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate appellate and cassation courts that are not on the same level as the regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but rather in judicial districts”.
The experts are using the experience of arbitration courts as a model.
They are part of judicial districts that do not correspond to the administrative division of the Russian Federation, and as a result, guarantee significant independence from regional officials, whose ability to use “telephone justice” is constrained.
The HRC proposes strengthening justices of the peace with people’s assessors, so as to examine certain “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, the termination of parental rights, employment reinstatement, slander suits, the revocation of driver’s licenses, and so forth.
“These are only our proposals”, a member of the HRC and a retired judge for the Constitutional Court, Tamara Morshchakova, explained to Kommersant.
She also reminded that the president’s mandate applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which still has not unveiled its proposals.
The SC (with its coauthors: the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Human Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation) still has time to fulfill the mandate.
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev must present a report to Vladimir Putin, by September 1, on how effectively the independence of the justice system is ensured in the Russian Federation.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.
The government has confirmed the establishment of a commission for cultural policy
The Russian government has approved the establishment of a commission on issues of state cultural policy.
A corresponding order was published on the government’s website.
According to the document, the primary objective of the commission will be the preparation and revision of strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The commission will also develop a draft strategy for cultural policy, clarify the mandate, and prepare new programs for its realization.
The deputy chair of the Russian Government has been appointed as head of the commission.
The commission’s membership will be confirmed separately.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved an implementation plan for the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan is comprised of 193 events and provides for measures aimed at expanding the influence of Russian culture in other countries, maintaining a common cultural space and cultural legacy, and it will also encourage the creation of conditions for cultural development in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has declined to an eight-year low
Growth of consumer prices in countries belonging to the G20 fell to the lowest level in the past eight years, the Wall Street Journal reports with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were at 2%; lower rates were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decline in Russia’s consumer price index by 0.1%.
As such, the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance’s calculations, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economic Development, however, is of the opinion that the target value has already been achieved: according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal deforestation during a meeting concerning the environmental development of Baikal’s natural territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoi, noted that a bill had been prepared already.
It permits forest clearing during the course of fire suppression efforts and the government is planning to pass it as early as the fall.
By the same token, the president said that it is necessary to keep an eye on this plan, so that “not everything in sight is cut down” during the clearing process.
Donskoi pointed out that this bill calls for oversight from EMERCON and watchdog agencies.
Media: UAF soldiers are negotiating with Donbass rebels in secret from military command
Regular telephone communication has been established at the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Soldiers from the opposing sides are continuously communicating with each other using mobile phones, and headquarters doesn’t know about this communication.
UAF soldiers and Donbass rebels have established communication via mobile phone in secret from their high commands.
Strana.ua reported this on August 4, citing combatants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication’s information, unit commanders know full well the names of their colleagues from the opposing side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
The communication is anything but ordinary: the commanders are trying to achieve certain “tactical agreements”.
Oftentimes, such conversations result in a truce along specific sections of the front.
Journalists have learned about instances where one officer or another has received birthday greetings across the frontline from his official enemy.
UAF soldiers and DNR and LNR rebels have been sitting in the trenches along the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council concerning attacks on the Russian Embassy
Russia’s foreign policy establishment is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic envoys that are blocking UN Security Council press statements condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this.
The ministry recalled how, on August 2, the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Damascus were subjected to mortar fire, for the third time in a month, at the hands of the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (the former al-Nusra Front, banned in Russia) and the Faylaq al-Rahman terrorist groups.
Considering that the international community unanimously classifies al-Nursa as a terrorist organization and that UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition against this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that “one would think that it would be self-evident that acts of terrorism by al-Nusra should be met with universal, unconditional, and resounding condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity when it comes to assessing attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the diplomatic service underscored, “for the third time in a month already, the diplomatic envoys of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Ukraine in the UN Security Council have taken turns, while varying the tone of their objections under the guise of an alleged absence of necessary information, blocking the Russian Federation’s proposal to issue a standard short draft press statement by the Security Council condemning the terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
May the unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to carry out new provocations and terrorist attacks and makes them feel that they can act with impunity”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, adding that “we wouldn’t want these barbarians to develop the conviction that someone in the Security Council is at one with them”.
Vladimir Putin has come out in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of businesses
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting about investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unscheduled inspections of business owners should be lowered to 30% of the number of scheduled ones, and he also spoke about the need to cap the time it takes to carry out an inspection at ten days.
“Unscheduled inspections are conducted, as a rule, without appropriate approval from the prosecutor’s office – only 2-3% are approved with the prosecutor’s office – and all the rest are carried out independently”, TASS quotes the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators must be prohibited from confiscating servers and hard disks within companies.
Furthermore, in the president’s opinion, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will have a clearly positive impact on the handling of cases related to business activities or related to violations of the law in the field of business”, the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of businesses is growing.
In May, a survey, commissioned by Presidential Business Ombudsman Boris Titov, was conducted that revealed that scheduled inspections had essentially been replaced by: unscheduled inspections (the share faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), inspections by the prosecutor’s office (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections requested by citizens (grew from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative inspections (10.8% to 15.5%).
More on business inspections in the Kommersant article: “They’re dropping in on small business from the other side”.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The Tyumen prosecutor’s office is fighting against an HIV dissident
The prosecutor’s office has challenged the decision of Tyumen’s Kalininsky District Court to drop criminal charges in relation to a local female resident whose young daughter died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because her mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court absolved her of responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with the aggrieved father.
The prosecutor’s office believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, so as to not set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the female resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (infliction of death by negligence) in April, following the death of her 3-year-old daughter from a stage 4B HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother is also HIV-positive.
“The woman didn’t get treatment for herself and refused treatment for her daughter, believing that HIV doesn’t exist”, the prosecutor’s office for Tyumen Oblast explained.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalininsky District Court, which made the decision to dismiss it on July 25.
A request for this was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that he had “forgiven his wife, holds no claims against her, and that she has made amends and has apologized”.
The prosecutor’s office did not agree with the court’s decision and filed an appeal demanding a reversal of the decision to dismiss the case and that it be sent for a retrial.
The young girl died and making amends for the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-positive mother, against the advice of doctors, refused an examination of the little girl and treatment of this dangerous infection for her”, the press service of the prosecutor’s office reported.
In the opinion of the regulatory agency, she should be punished; otherwise, other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, right now in Tyumen Oblast there are around 12 children who are sick with HIV who do not receive medical assistance as a result of their parents’ refusal to consent.
“But this situation has already improved: after a year of the special group’s work, half of the parents who had categorically refused to treat their children’s HIV had changed their minds, allowed diagnostics to be run, and started to take medications”, said the AIDS Center’s press secretary, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it’s impossible to influence parents using legal methods, and consequently, not all HIV-infected children are successfully identified: the mothers don’t allow them to be examined, go into hiding, and run away from the hospital with their children.
What dangers do HIV dissidents present?
At the end of last year, Saint Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first Russian study on the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
People who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicine are called HIV-dissidents.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call these views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
A gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, happened on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany train station in Khmelnytskyi.
A joyful group of tipsy young people was walking across a bridge over the railroad tracks, right where a freight train stood.
One of the friends came up with the idea of taking a dramatic selfie on the roof of the wagon, the police communications desk in Khmelnytskyi Oblast reported to FAKTY.
The young man started to climb down from the bridge onto the train, but, as a result of his carelessness, got hooked on the power line and was instantly electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher found out about this incident and quickly called an ambulance.
The injured individual was moved to a safe place before the arrival of doctors and was then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnytskyi Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1st and 2nd degree burns to his torso.
Right now, doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind us that extreme selfies, taken on the roofs of tall buildings, on bridges, and on top of moving vehicles, have gained increasing popularity as of late.
Police are asking people to be vigilant and not allow these types of photo sessions, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have accepted the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Oceans could have existed on ancient Venus.
French scientists have put forward such a hypothesis.
The experts created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turns out that, at the beginning of its history, oceans, which contained 10% more water than is currently on Earth, formed on Venus.
Earlier, Argumenty Nedeli wrote that, according to the scientists’ hypothesis, an ocean also could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Over the course of their research, the foreign experts came to the conclusion that the body of water was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured due to a shooting in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured due to a shooting, the Associated Press reports.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when a considerable number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge started shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
It wasn’t possible to discern the appearances of the perpetrators since they were completely covered-up, except for their eyes.
Another one was given medical assistance, after which he was let go.
The third wounded individual is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
Dolores Park, located on a hill, is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were wounded during a shooting in a nightclub in the city of Little Rock in the state of Arkansas.
Several patrons also were injured while trying to escape the building.
The rock band Louna will debut a new album in Barnaul
A concert by the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will debut their new album, “Brave New World”, which has become one of the year’s most anticipated releases.
The group is preparing a conceptual show, which will become the most spectacular in the band’s concert history.
“Brave New World” is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its title stems from A. Huxley’s famous dystopian novel, “Brave New World”.
The new songs don’t rehash the book, but rather speak about a society that lives according to dystopian law, “blindly believing the propaganda and imposed values”.
Listeners helped the band collect money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Louna released their first album, “Let’s Get Louder!”, in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians debuted their record “Time X”, and, in 2013, they recorded the album “We are Louna” (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the band Louna performed the “Songs about the World” program with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall.
The band Louna consists of: Lousine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass), Rouben Kazariyan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), and Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at Barnaul’s “Pharaoh” club on October 17 at 7 p.m.
Ticket prices range from 1,200 to 2,600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought-after groups in the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in various categories of the “Chart Dozen” hit parade.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
Crimea is incorporating the New World sparkling wine factory
It appears from an order by the Minister of Property and Land Relations for Crimea, Anna Anyukhina, that a decision has been made to incorporate the Republic of Crimea’s state unitary enterprise, New World sparkling wine factory, as JSC New World sparkling wine factory.
100% of the enterprise’s shares will remain the property of the government of Crimea.
The public company’s charter capital will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million common shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
Crimea’s Ministry of Agriculture has stated that, if funds to modernize the enterprise are not found over the next three years, then there will be a risk of a factory shutdown.
Depreciation of the enterprise’s fixed assets is around 60-70%.
1.2 billion rubles are required to modernize the enterprise. Given the nature of its legal and organizational form, it is obliged to hand over 50% of its profits to the state budget.
That which is left is insufficient to implement the modernization program.
“Getting the money from the owner is problematic, suggesting borrowing funds from large credit institutions is difficult”, said the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April of this year.
Crimea’s parliament has included the enterprise in the privatization forecast plan for 2017.
It was suggested that its incorporation be carried out and to put it up for sale.
An Interfax source in the Crimean organs of power assessed the possible sale price of the business at $40 million, with another $30 million to be put in for modernization by an investor.
In 2016, New World increased production of sparkling wines by 2.8%, as compared to the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World planned to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was established in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn, as a factory to produce sparkling wine at the New World estate acquired by him.
The factory is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders knocked over more than 40 headstones
Officers of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Nizhny Novgorod Oblast have established the identities of the citizens who destroyed 46 headstones at the cemetery in the town of Lyskovo.
The miscreants turned out to be students in the third grade.
The Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Lyskovo District received the first report about gravestones being damaged by unknown individuals back on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police in connection with this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: “Destruction, damage, or desecration of burial sites”.
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, who turned out to be two schoolchildren, aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the memorials fell, and this incited them to commit these acts of hooliganism.
Preventative measures have been carried out with both the children and their parents.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“We don’t want to be associated with any particular party to the conflict in Libya”
As of late, the Russian administration has noticeably intensified its policies on the Libyan front, and visits to Moscow by delegations from Libya’s opposing sides have become more frequent.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the auspices the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Duma and assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and whom they are placing their bets on.
There is almost nothing known about the contact group that you head on Libya.
While, for example, everyone knows about the contact group on Ukraine.
But, in this case, there is a veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing and what objectives are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a Duma deputy from Chechnya – Kommersant).
The latter was authorized to work on the Libya issue by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for establishing the group was the detainment of the Russian tanker, Mekhanik Chebotarev, in Libya (in September 2015; 11 people were on board – Kommersant).
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
It was at this time that the contact group, consisting of military experts and State Duma representatives, was created, and the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, supported our work.
And how did it turn out that you, specifically, took charge of it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, they approached me with the offer to lead the work of the group.
Our efforts weren’t restricted to the release of the sailors from the Mekhanik Chebotarev.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in Libyan conflict: both from the Tripoli camp (where the UN recognized government led by Fayez al-Sarraj is based – Kommersant) and from Tobruk (home to the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshall Halif Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya – Kommersant).
Thanks to the active involvement of Ahmed Maiteeq (the deputy prime minister of Libya – Kommersant), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
That is when it was decided to make more effective use of these contacts and create the contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and actors, and create a dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to specifically emphasize that we don’t want to be associated with any particular party to the conflict in Libya; we are engaged in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are part of the contact group and how many of them are permanently posted in Libya?
Currently, five people are part of the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in the security agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We would also like to bring regional experts, members of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Middle East Institute, into the group.
None of our staff are permanently posted in Libya, as there is currently no need for this.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya right now?
And, if yes, whose side are they on?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All the talk and reports about this are inconsistent with reality.
But there are ex-military members in your contact group…
Yes, and their presence is essential.
For example, when we visit combat zones.
Or, those cities that, up to a certain point, are closed to us, like Misurata (where rebel forces, who played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and became noticeably more active in following years, are based – Kommersant).
We travelled to Misurata in January of this year.
They frightened us, saying that it was full of Islamists and terrorists there.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there for ourselves: to analyze the actual military capacity, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are floating about, and what the real role of the Islamists is there.
In Misurata, we met with all of the representatives of the units that were engaged in destroying IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from militants of the Islamic State, which is banned in Russia – Kommersant).
We wanted to take a look at them, to get to know these people, to verify the intelligence that it was actually these people who played a decisive role in destroying IS in Libya and not Halif Haftar, who has taken credit for these achievements.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Was it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
It wasn’t him engaged in this.
Haftar was staging an operation on a different front, in Benghazi.
While entities loyal to the government in Tripoli were fighting against IS in Sirte.
By the way, we invited the people who carried out this antiterrorist operation to Russia.
And they came: the visit lasted from April 19-23 of this year, and the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Russian National Guard.
You, as we understand, visit all of Libya’s regions, and probably understand the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
What do you think: will it be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire and holding elections that Halif Haftar and Fayez al-Sarraj reached in July in Paris?
Or, as has happened multiple times in the past already, will the agreements be broken, will combat operations be resumed, and will the sides attempt to seize power single-handedly?
For us, the very fact that al-Sarraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting is a good sign: this wasn’t possible even a short while ago.
In the recent past, both the leaders spoke very negatively about one another.
As far as Russia’s position is concerned…
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We were confronted with this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar, on that very same day, came aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn’t believe it was a coincidence in Misurata.
They said to us: “You, it seems, are very brave people for coming to us on today of all days”.
But our aim, in fact, is to show that we don’t just support Haftar, but that we are engaged in dialogue with all of the major parties to the conflict in Libya.
You have associated with Haftar.
Does the fact that he twice studied in the USSR make mutual understanding with Russian partners easier on a personal and emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he even knows Russian, then it’s only a little bit.
But the fact that he studied here, of course, makes dialogue with him easier.
And not just with him, in fact.
When we associate with military officials in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have either studied in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia; they feel nostalgic about it to a certain extent.
Do you consider a lifting of the arms embargo placed on Libya likely in the near future?
Are your Libyan partners interested in shipments of Russian arms?
Of course they are interested, but as I’ve already said, we’re not taking anyone’s side in this conflict and we wouldn’t want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be on a more or less equal footing.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, the Libyan side is constantly calling on Russia to somehow facilitate its removal.
Right now the constitution-drafting process is actively moving ahead in Libya.
We hope that the sides will come to a compromise and achieve internal consensus.
After that, elections should be held, which was discussed at the meeting between al-Sarraj and Haftar.
If elections take place and a legitimate government is finally chosen (and right now, none of the parties enjoy that status), then it will be possible to bring up the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue right now is pointless and dangerous: it would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, information made it into the media about how Italy, faced with the issue of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels like it is being left high and dry by its allies in the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners with this situation, by using its connections with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic an option is it for Haftar’s units to establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of the smugglers who are trafficking immigrants into Europe?
That’s a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is engaged in simultaneous dialogue with Haftar, and with al-Sarraj, and with Misurata, and with the south of the country.
The tribes in the south of Libya play a big role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are you talking about Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on the periphery?
So, figuratively speaking, they have turned back the buses, on which the Nigerian migrants are riding?
We are aiming for this.
But it isn’t easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to facilitate the inclusion of Southerners in the negotiation process between al-Sarraj, Haftar, and the tribes in the South.
But first, we would like to see unanimity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and al-Sarraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj, is considered to be an Islamist and a proponent of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical are the views that he holds?
Won’t this become an obstacle to building a relationship with Russia or the West?
I will tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he personally supports the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country: moderately Islamic and open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting against terrorists.
Then why does he have such a reputation?
It’s created by those countries that are interested in preventing Russia from associating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital after all: it’s where the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government are located.
The national oil corporation is there, the national bank, and other government institutions.
Of course, some countries had an interest in not having us involved there.
But we’ve gone and thwarted their plans and have started to engage with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we’re already reaping the rewards of this work: Rosneft has signed a partnership agreement with Libya’s National Oil Company (NOC).
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanallah, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, signed the deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe it will be resold.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
There are plans to resign contracts that were concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the transportation sector (the construction of railways), the energy sector (electrification), and several other sectors.
And do the Libyans have anything to pay with?
Well, they have oil.
In other words, what we’re talking about, as is the case with Iran, is an arrangement of “oil in exchange for services”?
I don’t know what kind of arrangement it will be; I’m not directly involved with these matters.
In fact, economics aren’t the most important thing for Russia in Libya.
Ultimately, we are engaged in peace-building efforts there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed and to help the Libyans come to an agreement between themselves, so that they can establish order there and so that Libya stops being a breeding ground for terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main objective: to help the Libyan people and to force the terrorists out of there.
Do you have numbers on the presence (either currently or previously) of radical fighters from Russia or other former Soviet states in Libya?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to figure this out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan state security committee, who said that, at the moment, there isn’t a single native of Russia or any of the other former Soviet states there.
He said that he has around 50,000 recordings of telephone conversations of members of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya – Kommersant) and no spoken Russian can be heard.
But which states are the fighters coming from then?
I wouldn’t want to go into these details.
Then we’ll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyan themselves.
There are hardly any Libyans among them: they make up no more than 5%.
The rest of them are outsiders.
Could Moscow lead intra-Libyan negotiations according to the Paris model?
There are such plans.
We are holding active negotiations with the Libyans; several delegations have already visited Moscow, and they have announced their readiness to come again, to either Moscow or Grozny.
When might these negotiations take place?
It’s hard to say right now.
Several visits still need to take place, at which point I hope there will be some clarity as to the time and place of the negotiations.
Benefactors at the Chekhov Museum raised money for an expensive gift for a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and is completely blind, will receive the gift of a specialized treadmill on August 5 at the Moscow-area Melikhovo museum-reserve.
The useful present will be awarded to Sasha by the Minister of Culture for Moscow Oblast, Oksana Kosareva, and by the museum’s director, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the exercise equipment was raised during the “Don’t stop doing good deeds” charity marathon, which took place at Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
In the days leading up to the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in Chekhov District, which said: “My eyes can’t see anything, so I asked my mama to write this letter”.
“I would really like to receive the gift of a treadmill, so my legs can become strong, and so that I can learn how to walk a little bit”.
And now Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the presentation, a “Post Scriptum Concert” will be held at the museum-reserve, where the famous pianist and honored artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will play a medley of popular classical works.
The Ascension of David Monastery Choir, bell-ringers from Ilya Drozdikhin’s school, students from the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Gnessin Academy of Music, and actors from the Melikhovo Theater’s Chekhov Studio performed during the charity marathon at Melikhovo.
Auctions were held for visitors, and a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the logo of the marathon were organized.
The Melikhovo museum-reserve came forward with the initiative to make July 15 Chekhov Memorial Day: a collective day of charity for all the museums in the Moscow area.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, in Zhytomyr Oblast, fired several shots, near the local football stadium, in the direction of teenagers who were there.
In the words of the suspect, he was enraged by the noise, the department of police communication for Zhytomyr Oblast reported to FAKTY.
After this, the man went to a café located nearby.
A conflict arose with him on the premises, during which the man discharged a device used to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the patrons.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services responded to the scene; however, by that time, the shooter had fled.
Law enforcement officials established his identity and arrested him that same day, on August 2.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
The device used to shoot rubber bullets was seized from him and was sent for analysis.
Based on the evidence, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The individual in custody faces imprisonment for a period of between 3 to 7 years.
You will recall that, on the night of July 28, an assault involving gunfire took place in Kiev in the Lukyanivka neighborhood near Tatarska Street.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: “I let Langford go, like a high-flying bird”
One of the VTB United League’s best basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
UNICS President Evgeny Bogachev commented on the departure of the American defenseman to Izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, Evgeny Bogachev said.
He has a small child and a wife who don’t want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to accommodate him.
Of course, I could have said “no” and extended his contract, but he deserved better treatment.
He played three seasons with UNICS and performed at a high-level each match, putting in 100% effort.
And that’s why I let him go, like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015-16 United League.
In the 2016-17 season, he received the award for the top-scoring player of the season in the EuroLeague.
He earned an average of 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second highest since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to receive this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China’s Shenzhen, Eurohoops informs.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract in the amount of 5 million dollars.
Langford will be the second EuroLeague star in July who transfers to the Chinese Championship.
Earlier, Panathinaikos’ former center, Ioannis Bourousis, moved to the Chinese CBA.
A sunburnt tourist from Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Today, Adygea emergency response personnel used a helicopter to evacuate a tourist from the Moscow area, who sustained a severe sunburn, from the republic’s mountainous region.
The man was vacationing at the Fisht camping shelter, which is situated at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and was also having difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The leader of the tour group, who said that the man had sustained a sunburn while hiking, contacted emergency response personnel.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
In Astrakhan, a café patron paid with counterfeit money
The police received a report from a female employee of a bank branch about a suspicious bill, in the denomination of 5,000 rubles, which came from a fast-food establishment and was detected during a money count.
An examination, conducted at the Criminal Expertise Center, determined that it was counterfeit.
The Regional Office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Astrakhan Oblast reports that one of the café patrons, who bought a shawarma, paid with the banknote.
It’s worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bill.
Currently, police are in the process of identifying the individuals involved in the manufacture and distribution of the knowingly counterfeit Russian Central Bank bill.
These types of crimes are punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to 8 years, with a fine in the amount of 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is urging residents of Astrakhan Oblast to be attentive when making financial transactions; it is recommended that employees of sales outlets install devices to determine the authenticity of money received.
Astronomers have discovered a “hellish” planet where even iron can be melted
Having studied the properties of the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b for the first time, astrophysicists were more than a little surprised by its temperature, which is capable of vaporizing iron and other metals.
The experts noticed that water molecules were heated to such an extent by the light of the star that they were emitting infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope captured the light from water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature forces the water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared band.
WASP-121b falls into the category of so-called “hot Jupiters”: gas giants that, in terms of size and mass, are comparable to the biggest planets of the Solar System, but are located ten times closer to their parent star.
On account of this, a year on the exoplanet lasts for just 1.3 “Earth days”, and its atmosphere is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
The ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey and ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade, Alexander Semin, met with beginner hockey players the other day and signed autographs for fans.
The meeting took place at the 2019 Winter Universiade tent, as part of a week dedicated to ice hockey.
Each visitor to the tent could skate on a rink with artificial ice.
In addition to this, relay races, trivia quizzes and games with souvenirs from the student games for prizes, and a workout routine from the Federation of Aerobics were organized.
50 schoolchildren took part in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the kids to get as involved as possible in sport activities and stressed that the most important thing when starting out is hard work and an enormous desire to play hockey.
“It’s great that there’s a place in Krasnoyarsk like the 2019 Winter Universiade tent, where beginner athletes can ask team coaches questions in person”, the champion said.
It bears noting that the 2019 Winter Universiade ambassadors will help to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will continue to operate for the entire summer season, up until September 25, reports the press service for the 2019 Winter Universiade Directorate.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s words
The official spokesperson for the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a briefing, spoke about the need to find “areas of cooperation” with Russia.
In her words, such areas need to be found in order to “improve bilateral cooperation”.
She named the agreement on the ceasefire in Syria as an example of such successful collaboration.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people throughout the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other”, the diplomat said.
That being said, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s assertion about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia said this, well, of course it has a right to say this, but I can’t say anything more on this topic”, the State Department spokesperson said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Medvedev, the head of the Russian government, stated that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war against Moscow, putting to rest hopes for an improvement in bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the US sanctions would last for decades.
Furthermore, the prime minister believes that the American establishment has “fully outwitted” Trump.
A bodybuilder, who went missing in the Moscow area, was found in a stranger’s dacha suffering from memory loss
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under entirely fascinating circumstances: he stepped out of the car to go to the toilet.
Friends and local residents spent seven days unsuccessfully looking for him.
But Shamil was found at a stranger’s dacha in Ramensky.
The owner found him completely naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestani athlete was unable to explain how he got there and what had happened to him.
He couldn’t even remember what his name was and his passport was missing.
Notices about his disappearance helped to identify him.
The medics who responded to the call established that Khanmetov had partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury, the Mash public page reports.
It is likely that the athlete is in for even more surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil have probably already been to his apartment, the keys for which they also stole from him.
Oil and gas revenues for July have exceeded forecasts by 7.4 billion rubles
At the end of July 2017, actual oil and gas revenues earned exceeded estimates by 7.4 billion rubles, the Russian Ministry of Finance reports.
The surplus, the agency explains, occurred largely as a result of the higher US dollar to ruble exchange rate compared to the monthly average for June that was used for the estimate, as well as by virtue of the fact that actual gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products exceeded projected levels.
“In August 2017, the deviation of oil and gas revenues in the federal budget from the monthly estimate, according to the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles”, a Ministry of Finance statement says.
As such, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market for the period of August 7 to September 6, 2017, amounts to RUB 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase volume of foreign currencies will amount to an equivalent of RUB 2.07 billion.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the foreign currency purchase transactions made by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Every business day, over the course of the specified period, the Central Bank will carry out foreign currency purchase transactions via trading on the Moscow Exchange, at regular intervals throughout the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who formerly led Georgia and then Odessa Oblast in Ukraine, arrived by plane in Poland.
Furthermore, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili was reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his address on their YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician doesn’t know Polish, even though he attempted to start his speech in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The embattled politician learned about the fact that Ukraine’s migration service had revoked his citizenship while he was in the United States.
It is still unclear how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa Oblast, Mikheil Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the application form for Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had never filled-out any such forms.
The period of investigation for the case against Vainzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The time period for the preliminary investigation into the case against the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of T Plus energy holding, Boris Vainzikher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the matter of extending house arrest for the accused parties.
A spokesperson for the Investigative Committee reported the most recent decision to extend the time period for the preliminary investigation at a meeting.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation stems from the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large volume of documents, as well as carry out investigative measures in several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator declared.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to leaders in Komi.
Their total sum is estimated at no less than a billion rubles.
According to investigators, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, and the former head of CJSC Integrated Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin (who ran the company VimpelCom up until September 5), were handing over bribes to senior government officials in the Komi Republic in return for the establishment of extremely lucrative rates for thermal and electric power, as well as for the creation of favorable business conditions.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were apprehended, transported to Syktyvkar, and held under arrest for two months; Slobodin has evaded investigators and was put on the federal wanted list.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were suspended for biting US players
Team El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Cerén received long-term suspensions for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarterfinal match of the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football’s (CONCACAF) Gold Cup, the Salvadorans bit American players.
The defender Henry Romero was the first to make his mark.
The Salvadoran bit striker Jozy Altidore and then he pinched his chest.
Then, midfielder Cerén, during a corner kick in his penalty area, bit US defender Omar Gonzalez.
Consequently, Romero was suspended for three matches and Cerén for six.
The game itself ended with a victory for the Americans with a score of 2:0, Goal.com reports.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
A fire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai has been put out
The massive blaze, which occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been put out, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to deal with all of the sources of fire by 4:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m. Moscow Time).
Local authorities reported that no one was hurt as a result of the incident.
The roads around the skyscraper were closed while the fire was being put out.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
Earlier, it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, was on fire.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova’s jaw-dropping outfit shocks fans: pants that don’t cover panties
Olga Buzova, the scandalous host of the reality TV show “Home 2”, astounded spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival by dancing in panties.
The newly minted singer performed the song “We will be hot”, in a duet with Nastia Kudry, in front of thousands of fans.
Both girls hit the stage in provocative “pants”, sewn in such a fashion that the singers’ undergarments were in plain view.
The pants were inscribed with the names Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist from one of Moscow’s plastic surgery clinics commented on changes in Buzova’s appearance.
Stoltenberg has acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
Radio 4 news service reported this on Friday, August 4, with reference to foreign media organizations.
According to him, it is the Russian government that is responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the Secretary General of NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and for “destabilization in the east of Ukraine”.
That being said, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and that further escalation of the situation would not be beneficial to any of the parties involved.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level and he blamed the US Congress for this.
Yekaterinburg’s metro is introducing a new method of payment
In October, it will be possible to pay for travel on Yekaterinburg’s metro using a bankcard, the General Director of OAO I-Network, Pavel Vedernikov, announced in an interview with Oblastnaya Gazeta.
Our objective is to introduce the same type of payment system for travel on the metro as in other major cities like Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Novosibirsk for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
“We would like fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metropolitan using their bankcards, without having to get tokens or wait in line”, he said.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
In Barnaul, the new asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt is being dug up
In Barnaul, drastic measures have been taken to determine the reason for asphalt cave-ins on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt.
A decision has been made to “dig up” the area where holes have twice appeared on the recently paved roadway (at the intersection with Molodyozhnaya Street).
To recap, the collapse of a small section of the road close to the tram tracks happened as a result of the ground sinking in the area of an abandoned and out-of-operation utilities network.
According to the deputy chair of the city committee for road facilities, improvements, transport, and communications, Ivan Garmat, they will conduct a thorough examination to achieve a detailed survey and eliminate the conditions that led to the collapse.
Necessary measures will be taken according to its results.
It is anticipated that reconstruction of the abandoned utility lines and their encasement in concrete will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the territory’s capital.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
All the victims of the terror attack in Saint Petersburg have been released from hospital
Everyone who was injured during the terror attack in the Saint Petersburg metro in April has been released from hospital.
This was reported by the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospital, TV Tsentr reports.
You will recall that an explosion rattled the Saint Petersburg metropolitan on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
15 people died as a result of the terrorist attack, as did the perpetrator himself.
11 people were arrested on criminal charges, including the suspected mastermind, Abror Azimov.
You will recall that, the other day, Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the Saint Petersburg metropolitan reassess its action plan to ensure transport security, including increasing the number of walk-through metal detectors.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
A conflict is developing within the Association of Russian Banks (ARB): another seven credit organizations are preparing to ditch this non-governmental organization, taking their cue from Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, B&N Bank, and Otkritie FC.
As such, the share of those that have left the ARB will account for no less than 80 percent of the market.
But this isn’t just a departure: all the banks that have announced their break with the ARB are in negotiations with another non-governmental organization that unites credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is led by the well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, who was, in fact, recognized at the end of the last session as the most effective Duma committee leader and deputy, in terms of the amount of draft legislation prepared.
The conflict inside of the ARB started during a discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were being reviewed in the Interregional Banking Council, including those calling for a new classification of banks in relation to the size of their authorized capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that, in the association’s opinion, this bill was being adopted in the interests of the largest banks, who were using this method to try and limit opportunities for small and medium-size banks in the regions, while poaching their customer base.
Among other complaints, criticism was also voiced against the Central Bank, which, to Tosunyan’s mind, is not always justified in revoking the licenses of some banks, which, truth be told, was followed by an objection from a representative of the Central Bank: many of the managers of the banks at fault, particularly Vneshprombank, were members of the ARB’s governing bodies.
Apparently, this exchange of conflicting opinions, in a banking environment that is highly sensitive to relations with the main regulator, was the apparent reason for the fifteen largest banks, having expressed their disagreement with ARB policies, to start preparing to join the “Russia” association, noting that the “efficacy of the ARB’s work is poor, and that there is virtually no constructive dialogue conducted within the banking association”.
Depositors will be better off
How will things end?
Right away, let’s answer the main question that comes up with the slightest upset or conflict in the banking sector or close to it: depositors are in no danger, if anything, the reliability of the banking system will improve.
“Russia” is led by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients; a first-rate professional who is highly regarded at the Central Bank: virtually the entire leadership of the Central Bank attends the association’s annual events, and all of the regulator’s relevant legislative initiatives go through the expert evaluations of the “regionals”.
In human resources and organizational terms, it is also clear that no significant disturbances are expected.
There’s no question that the ARB is putting itself in a complex financial and administrative situation, after losing such powerful and influential members with their financial contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, there is still a lot of potential in this long-standing (established in 1991) organization, which advocates for the interests of the banking community, to continue to improve banking legislation and the area of monetary and credit circulation in general.
That’s not to say that the “Russia” association is ready to welcome new members with open arms on any terms, judging from the reaction of its director, Anatoly Aksakov (“perhaps they want too much”), who, back on July 21, at a briefing at Parlamentskaya Gazeta’s press center, said that “the very next day, representatives from the banks that left the ARB were asking me to look at the possibility of expanding the potential of our ‘Russia’ association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers on the association’s board, as well as to focus more on new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is currently underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and the agenda is being prepared for the association’s extraordinary congress, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international baking forum.
And that’s where we will make a decision.
Furthermore, Anatoly Aksakov, making it clear that he “isn’t clinging to the position”, named Grigory Luntovsky, who is leaving his post as deputy chair of the Central Bank in September, as the possible new head of a revamped “Russia” association, having spoken highly of his professional and personal qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day to travel to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the board of the “Russia” association, where it is planned to discuss the matter of the agenda for the extraordinary congress of “Russia”.
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia would not be restricted yet.
This is a more radical version of our concept.
Our concept is that it’s necessary to gradually improve the emission class.
And there, the concept is to immediately move to zero emissions.
I believe that, in terms of technology, we are not ready for this.
The question still is: as of what year?
It’s, like, on the same level as slogans with the phrase: “Let’s Ban It!”
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
“In 20 years time, I don’t know, maybe that might happen”, Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, Izvestia newspaper reported that Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich has been assigned to study, by August 17, proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, which were submitted to the government by the CEO of PJSC KAMAZ, Sergey Kogonin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper’s information, is the use of cars with internal combustion engines in major cities and resorts.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
The Los Angeles native, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, competing for Team Ukraine since 2013, won’t be helping our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final phase of which starts on August 31.
The general manager for the “blue-and-yellows”, Andrei Lebedev, spoke about this in an interview with the BeBasket website.
We tried to come to an agreement with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won’t be coming due to family circumstances.
We will go to Eurobasket without the naturalized player, since we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will give us an opportunity to develop our young players”, he said.
Let me remind you that, with Jeter’s direct involvement, Team Ukraine claimed a record sixth place for itself in Eurobasket 2013, and, for the first time, made it into the World Basketball Championship, where the “yellow-and-blues” were unable to make it past the group stage, but the US native averaged 15.4 points, three rebounds, and 5 assists per game.
Jeter stopped playing for Team Ukraine at the time of the departure of the head coach for our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The 2017 Men’s Eurobasket will be held in four countries at the same time: Turkey, Romania, Israel, and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its group stage matches in the Promise Land.
Evgeni Murzin’s protégés in Group B will have five battles against Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (September 3), Lithuania (September 5), and Israel (September 6).
As part of their training for the tournament, our men’s team played two friendly matches, which they lost to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The individual suspected of beating an NTV journalist has been ordered not to leave town
The capital’s law enforcement officials have imposed a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions on the man who assaulted an NTV television channel journalist, Nikita Razvozzhayev, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
TASS reported this, citing the official spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
“As part of the criminal investigation initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Battery), in relation to the 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the television channels in the face in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure, a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions and proper conduct has been imposed on the suspect”, Volk clarified.
The spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for failure to obey the police has been drawn up in relation to the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, an inebriated man walked up to the correspondent and hit him in the face.
It turned out later that this hooligan had no connection whatsoever with the airborne forces.
According to Razvozzhayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused US Vice President Michael Pence of using Cold War era rhetoric
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence’s European tour came under criticism from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“Regretfully, it must be acknowledged that Washington is slipping ever deeper into the primitive ideologically driven clichés of the Cold War era, which are entirely detached from reality”, a statement from the Russian foreign policy establishment reads.
This is how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw border, said by him in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of a choice of “either you’re with the West, or you’re with Russia” and the questionable thesis about the allegedly incontrovertible accession of all of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
The Russian diplomats also reminded that it was the United States, in fact, that violated international law by using force to tear Kosovo away from Serbia and consequently created yet another hotbed of tension.
“We urge our American colleagues to stop demonizing Russia and its foreign policy, which has always been based on respect for our partners and a willingness to work together constructively on mutual interests”, reads a statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
A paramedic was injured in a traffic accident with an ambulance in the Moscow area
The traffic accident happened in Stupino outside of the Moscow; a paramedic was injured as a result of the collision between an import vehicle and an ambulance.
Today, at approximately 8:10 a.m. (Moscow Time), a collision between a Mitsubishi vehicle and an ambulance occurred in the city of Stupino in Moscow Oblast.
“The ambulance vehicle flipped over as a result of the collision”, the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Moscow Region told TASS.
Law enforcement officials are working at the scene of the traffic accident and the circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa Oblast, a woman dumped her newborn son, wrapped up in a plastic bag, at a construction site.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police station received a report from a local resident about how he had found a bag with a newborn inside of it in a partially constructed detached house.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors responded to the scene and immediately transported the child to a medical facility”, the main office of the National Police in Odessa reported.
Medics determined that the boy was born just a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
The identity of the mother was determined during preliminary investigative and operational measures: a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also established that the woman has three other young children.
As the main office noted, the family was not previously known to law enforcement officials and wasn’t registered with any particular authorities.
At this time, police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that drove the woman to commit this act, after which a procedural judgment will be made.
Currently, the newborn is under medical supervision.
Earlier, it was reported that a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaev dumped her premature baby down a garbage disposal chute.
Grigory Leps: “I’m ready to leap into action, even though I’m 55, not 30”
One of the most successful entertainers on the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, is celebrating his 55th birthday this coming Sunday.
The singer spoke with an Izvestia staff writer ahead of the celebration.
I remember how your “fiftieth” was marked.
There was a special pavilion at the Luzhniki Sports Complex, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, and there was a massive fireworks display over the Moscow River.
At that moment, you probably thought about how you’d like to spend your next five years.
Did your plans come to fruition?
If we’re talking about my career, this was a successful period.
I was working a lot, toured throughout the entire country three times, and put on between 120-130 concerts per year.
I released two decent albums.
Of course, today, I’m no longer the person I was, let’s say, 20 years ago.
You can’t fool your biological clock.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is becoming more difficult.
Still, I’m ready to leap into action and I don’t want to stop.
And, with new people, I feel like I’ll reach another level.
And you’re recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yes, it’s currently being worked on.
In fact, we already recorded everything in my studio and now we’ll send it off to Los Angeles for mastering.
It’s called “Why are you so serious?”, after a song by the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
It’s still not entirely ready, so we haven’t put it out anywhere yet.
We’ll do this later, when the music video for it has also been filmed.
But we’ll put the album out in November, for the series of my anniversary concerts at Moscow’s Crocus City Hall.
The first-rate American drummer, Chris Coleman, had a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted to entice him to join your touring band?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most accomplished drummers in the world today.
He came to me in the studio and recorded his parts.
I invited him to join my group, and I invited Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer who is involved in various projects – Izvestia).
However, for ongoing work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about compensation between €35,000 and €45,000 per month.
Then, I thought that I would track down worthy musicians in the post-Soviet region.
And I found an excellent drummer, Max Malyshev.
At the end of the day, it’s better to feed your own people (smiling).
From time to time, I want to find fault with one of them, but there’s no reason.
For example, the guitarist Feodor Dosymov is highly respected internationally.
Western music magazines write about him and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, having listened to him play, said “a new generation of guitarists with a different technique of playing has arrived”.
Your album is being mastered in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you personally still can’t travel to the United States?
Are you trying to get this ban lifted?
Right now, to be honest, I’m not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I am really very sorry that I can’t get into America.
I’ve mentioned more than a few times that I learn when I’m there.
The more you associate with real professionals, the better.
We’re no dumber than them, but we don’t have the same experience or schools.
Over the course of 70 years, our popular music performers were by no means faced with the same challenges that American musicians have always been tackling.
They have been working towards achieving the highest quality of sound.
And I try to follow the exact same principles.
Now, for some reason, Great Britain has banned me from entering for ten years.
But I will still submit a visa application at the British Embassy every year, so that once again, they permit me to travel, and most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe is friendly toward me.
As early as August, you have a concert planned in Monaco, and not a private concert, but an advertised one, right?
Yes, there is a great hall in Monte Carlo, the Sporting; I performed there once already.
Now, they have invited me again, and as far as I know, all of the concert tickets have already sold out.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikule Rendezvous Festival, which starts on July 20 in Jūrmala?
She invited me, and of course, I accepted.
Laima is a remarkable singer and a magnificent woman who knows how to express herself, her beautiful vocals, and even whispers.
After the tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you would like to turn, once again, to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third be out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record around 80-90 of Vysotsky’s songs in the same manner of style he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov, will accompany me.
I’m also going to try and entice Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to take part in the album.
I walked through the idea with him, we’ve got a good relationship, but he is a busy person, so we’ll have to see what happens.
You’ve also gradually introduced the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov into your repertoire.
Perhaps you’ll also record an album of his stuff later on?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a magnificent musician.
I’ve bumped into him on several occasions and have asked: can I sing this or that song of his?
He responded: “Grigory, I write songs to be performed”.
Please, give it a go and sing them.
I suppose it would also be interesting to record an album like this.
I have no such plans at the moment, but down the road, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t mind, I might do a project like this.
That is, if you don’t concentrate entirely on the business of your production center.
I suspect that you haven’t yet realized its potential or signed contracts with all the artists of interest to you?
There’s a whole group of performers that I dream of having under my wing, but they are self-sufficient and accomplished individuals.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer; I invited him to join me.
I might disagree with something in his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
But Alexander Panayotov, whom I mentored in The Voice, is now with my center.
We signed a contract with him and we’re working.
In our pop music scene, singers like him are rare.
It would be a real shame if he falls short of the heights of which he is capable.
I’m trying to select a repertoire for him and film music videos.
I’m hoping for a good outcome.
I’m also trying to promote the other artists with my center: I buy them songs, pay the lyricists, and sometimes their tracks make it into rotation on the television channels and radio stations.
If they don’t reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
At the end of the process, they’ll get a recorded album and several music videos.
After that, they can go their own way if they want, and I won’t insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although, I would be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the percentage we agreed to in the contract.
But if this doesn’t happen, I don’t intend to pull the plug on anyone.
Let everyone work, find their way, and prove themselves like I proved myself a long time ago.
If tomorrow you were offered a road tour across Ukraine and they guaranteed entry into the country, would you go?
I still get invited to go there.
Generally, we’re talking about private events.
But in terms of a big tour…
I am a man of my country, a Russian citizen; it was my own choice to fly to Syria on the same airplane that crashed later on.
If tomorrow, they say I need to fly to another place in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don’t give a damn what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that we have this type of situation with Ukraine.
As far as I’m concerned, we are one people and we should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least not in the near future.
But before, I was performing 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They were welcoming like nowhere else.
They are a very grateful audience.
I also collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik…
There is a multitude of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly unfortunate that they are now unable to fully share their talent with the wider Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be delighted to invite some top-notch Ukrainian performer to Russia, Slava Vakarchuk for example, and hold a joint concert with him.
But I think, at this time, it’s highly unlikely…
Andrei Okhlopkov has been transferred from the cosmodrome
It came to Kommersant’s attention that the technical director for the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Andrei Okhlopkov, has taken on a job at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SSRPC).
Previously, he was de facto in charge of building the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Space Ground Based Infrastructure (COSGBI), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Fili neighborhood of Moscow, where he will be engaged in coordinating operations.
There won’t be a replacement for Mr. Okhlopkov: the position of technical director will most likely be eliminated and the job responsibilities will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
Kommersant was told about the fact that Vostochny’s technical director and COSGBI’s deputy head for technological development, Andrei Okhlopkov, had transferred to a job with SSRPC by several senior executives of companies in the space industry, as well as by a government staff worker.
“He has been working in the new position for several weeks already”, clarified Kommersant’s industry sources.
It wasn’t possible to get a prompt response from COSGBI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, Kommersant’s information was officially confirmed by SSRPC.
He made the decision to transfer to the position of director for the coordination of operations, the enterprise stated. Andrei Okhlopkov, tasked with providing the minimum number of facilities required for the first launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome, fully accomplished this.
Mr. Okhlopkov started working at COSGBI in 2013, having service in the space forces under his belt, specifically at Baikonur and at Plesetsk (at the “northern” cosmodrome, he held the post of deputy commander with the rank of colonel).
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov was a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, at his behest, regional businessmen in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Komi Republic were receiving state orders for kickbacks, but they weren’t delivering on their commitments to clean the separable parts of the launch vehicle.
In 2012, a trial by jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities for the development of technology assigned to him at COSGBI were distributed across various projects, but the most important of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
In an interview with Kommersant, Oleg Ostapenko, who headed up the Federal Space Agency at that time, said frankly that the situation at Vostochny “was already critical in October 2013”.
The fact of the matter is that a strategic mistake was made during planning: the completion of construction and launch of the Soyuz 2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the very same time – the end of 2015.
In order to accomplish the launch by the end of the year, they decided to complete construction six months early and deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to get more than a little bit inventive: COSGBI specialists started the parallel installation of support equipment at facilities that were still under construction.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
In spite of the substantial risks, and the fact that it was postponed anyhow (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz was only launched on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified in and of itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: “Otherwise, we still wouldn’t have completed a single launch from Vostochny, but would be engaged in construction”.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is overseeing the establishment of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “space Susanin”, but more often than not, he was requesting information about the pace of construction from him specifically.
Mr. Okhlopkov also stands out in one’s mind for his straightforwardness; for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he suggested stripping the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroi) of its status as the exclusive contractor for Vostochny and working directly with subcontractors: “Why should we put all our eggs in Spetsstroi’s basket?”
This idea found support within the government.
As of 2017, COSGBI took on the duty of principal contractor in order to complete construction and installation work on the launch site and technical facilities by the launch date scheduled for the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov’s transfer to a new place of work was a disagreement with COSGBI management about the means for completing construction of the cosmodrome’s facilities and complexes, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone”, says one of the senior executives involved in the construction of Vostochny.
The government staffer, in turn, calls the decision odd: “He was one of the best experts; it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement for him”.
According to Kommersant, this won’t be necessary: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be eliminated and its functions will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
An educational program with two specializations is coming to music schools
In the future, pupils at children’s music schools will be able to receive two specializations at once.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Svatoslav Golubenko, in order to achieve this, students will be able to receive credit for courses already taken, while the question of payment for the remaining classes of the second specialization will be resolved with the assistance of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over responsibility for this issue and we, in cooperation with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will make it possible to earn two specializations, but that will not contravene existing legislation in the field of education”, Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Grown-Up Conversation” with pupils at the Sirius children’s center, Maria Andreeva, a schoolgirl, reported that she is required to pay for duplicate subjects for her second specialization at the Moscow Conservatory’s Central Music School.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards from competitions in both disciplines.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian national who scaled the side of a skyscraper has been detained in Mexico
A 17-year-old Russian national, Kirill N., who climbed up the side of a high-rise building onto the roof, has been detained in Mexico, the El Universal website reports.
The incident occurred in the country’s capital, Mexico City.
The youth, with the assistance of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the grounds of the Nestle office building complex and climbed up one of its towers on his own.
Moreover, he didn’t use any special equipment, belay, or ropes.
The young man was already on the roof when he was detained.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Safety lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
Subsequently, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There, they are determining if the youth is in the country legally.
In the meantime, the video with the young man climbing up the high-rise has become popular online.
Users have dubbed the youth, “Spiderman”.
According to the news media, these types of experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
The former leaders of Lithuania’s social democrats are persuading them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former chairs of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Česlovas Juršėnas, urged their fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported, as a result of tensions with their partners –the Farmers and Greens Union – a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic party about whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
And then, the three experienced senior colleagues appealed to their fellow party members in an open letter, which, in part, reads: “The disappointment of our party colleagues with the results of the election is understandable; however, the coalition with the ‘farmers’ has created for us – albeit not very easy ones, but still – all the conditions for the further realization of the goals of social justice (which, as a result of our initiative, are included in the government’s program) and for preserving the political domination of the center-left parties over the parties of the right”.
According to the former party leaders, so far the discussion “has been predominated by expressions of opinion based on emotions, without concrete arguments”.
The letter’s authors fear that the ill-considered actions of their party could lead to political, economic, and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine has been imposed against the disabled man, Anton Mamayev
The Moscow City Court has mitigated punishment for the wheelchair-bound disabled man, Anton Mamayev, from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted defendant was released from a pretrial detention facility by an earlier decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
Having said this, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and theft of a motorized scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The decision of the Moscow City Court reduced Anton Mamayev’s punishment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
“Mamayev is the mastermind of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and as such, this individual should be convicted of a criminal offense”, the press secretary for the Moscow City Court, Ulyana Solopova, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamayev’s health, the facts of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition to this, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment less than the minimum sentence can be imposed.
As for Mamayev’s accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court didn’t find facts that would have provided grounds for recategorizing the severity of the offense and changing the judgment.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legitimate decision would have been an acquittal; I intend to keep fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, didn’t rule out an appeal of the judgment in a cassation proceeding through the Moscow City Court and in the Supreme Court.
“We will make use of all the levers of power, right up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he told RIA Novosti.
To recall, the 28-year-old Muscovite, Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, was the defendant in a criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled man contends that he bought the motorized scooter from an acquaintance for 160,000 rubles in order to then sell it.
However, the owners of the motorized scooter, which include a former special forces soldier, stated that the disabled man and his accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, took their property from them under the threat of violence.
On June 30, Moscow’s Timiryazevsky District Court sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years of imprisonment, with punishment to be served in a standard regime penal colony (in accordance with part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobile disabled man was placed in a pretrial detention facility, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the President’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Tatyana Moskalkova, got involved in the case.
As a result, Anton Mamayev was released from the pretrial detention facility in the middle of July, by a decision of the very same Timiryazevsky Court.
The defendant, in turn, disputed the first instance decision in the Moscow City Court.
The All-Russia People’s Front will prepare a report on the environment for the president
The All-Russia People’s Front’s (ONF) final “Action Forum” in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, a source in the ONF reported to Izvestia and the head of the movement’s executive committee, Alexey Anisimov, confirmed.
According to him, based on the results of the forum, members of the front plan to prepare a report for the president on domestic environmental issues, as well as suggest strategies to solve them.
Izvestia’s sources in the ONF note that the report for the head of state will consist of a “deep analysis” of the situation in all of the country’s federal districts.
According to Izvestia, ONF’s final forum will take place in the fall.
The exact date it will be held is still to be determined, but as a rule, it is adjusted to fit the schedule of the president, who is the movement’s leader and traditionally attends the ONF’s major events.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one after the other, in two federal districts: in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad, and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
We will form comprehensive proposals to solve environmental issues based on the suggestions made and those that will be made at these events, a source in the ONF told Izvestia.
The co-chair of the movement’s central office, Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that members of the front will report to the head of state on the work conducted as part of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The ONF’s final environmental forum and “Action Forum” will most likely be combined.
In span of one year, we have acquired a powerful group of experts in the area of environmental issues, uncovered loopholes in legislation, and put an end to dozens of legal violations.
All of this will go into the report that we are preparing for the president, in his capacity as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, members of the front will also report on work on the ONF’s priority projects, Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the President’s Special Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport, Sergei Ivanov, will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he took part in the work of the ONF’s Mediaforum, which was held in Saint Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be consigned to history, but the most important thing that needs to be done right now is to set in motion environmental protection mechanisms so that they will work for many years to come.
So that these issues remain on the agenda, Olga Timofeeva added.
The head of the regional politics laboratory at the Expert Institute of Social Studies (EISS), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that, by raising environmental issues, the ONF are acting inline with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they have suggested many things in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that, today, it is impossible to ignore the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which might offer the regions an additional impetus for reform.
Down the road, with the assistance of the ONF, regions could lobby not only for a solution to their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June demonstrated the relevance of environmental issues.
Specifically, the president was asked questions about a waste landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port city of Nakhodka (a bill has already been drafted prohibiting the open handling of coal in populated areas; one of its authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of environmental studies are of the opinion that the legal framework for solving environmental issues in Russia has, by and large, been established: the crux of the matter is continued regulatory enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
Firm implementation of decisions made by the state is essential, believes the head of the charitable foundation, Ecology for Everyone, Leonid Bochin.
In a conversation with Izvestia, Sergey Tsyplyonkov, a member of the Human Rights Council and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, underscored that successfully tackling environmental issues will require society and business to make a commitment: legislative efforts on their own are not enough.
As soon as society and business recognize that solving environmental issues is a far more beneficial step in the long term, the situation will change, Sergey Tsyplyonkov noted.
The expert stressed the necessity of overcoming the belief that a violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Moscow will allocate grants for the emergency care departments of city hospitals
Every year “Saving Lives” grants will be allocated for the emergency care departments and intensive care units of the capital’s medical clinics.
Funds will be spent to incentivize doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the city’s Yudin Clinical Hospital.
During the tour of the clinic, he presented a letter of recognition to orthopedic trauma surgeon Viktor Protsko, under whose direction an extremely difficult operation to reconstruct a teenager’s foot was conducted.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate annual grants to the emergency care departments and intensive care units of the city’s clinics.
Funds will be spent to incentivize doctors and nurses.
According to the capital’s mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the biggest in Moscow today.
Over the past few years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that has enabled its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the site of the Kolomenskaya Village Hospital.
These days, the medical institution’s units are designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
In addition to an emergency care department and an inpatient unit, there is also an outpatient care unit here.
The hospital’s staff amounts to 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project to set up short-term inpatient care facilities.
They are designed for conducting relatively minor operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used during surgery, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation for patients.
After an operation, they only spend a few hours in the hospital.
In just the first six months of this year, inpatient medical care was provided to 36,000 patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of difficulty.
The NBU has reported a lack of buyers for Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”
The National Bank of Ukraine has reported an absence of bids to purchase Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
TASS, with reference to the spokesperson for NBU’s press service, reported about this on Friday, August 4.
The NBU confirms that a package of documents from Viktor Prokopenya, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, for approval of the indirect acquisition (via Paritetbank) of 100% of Sberbank’s shares, was withdrawn on August 3, 2017.
“The NBU has not received paperwork for the purchase of Sberbank’s shares from other potential investors”, it is noted in a statement.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman, Viktor Prokopenya, withdrew his bid to purchase Sberbank’s subsidiary.
On July 28, it came to light that the National Bank of Ukraine had barred Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov from acquiring Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen didn’t provide the paperwork required to check their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “offshoot” to the consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belorussian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium is Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “offshoots” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which Sberbank found itself, were introduced in mid-March.
They are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of their parent organizations for a period of one year.
Narcos season 3 trailer: With Pablo Escobar gone, the Cali Cartel take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite season two of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the former receiving its first trailer, teasing the show's upcoming villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned their attention towards the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) being the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) running the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) based in New York.
The newly released trailer sees Pedro Pascal return as Javier Peña, the character enlisting American and Colombian law enforcement to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
Season three of Narcos will debut 1 September.
Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.
The Prosecutor General’s Office has approved an indictment in the Nikita Belykh case
The Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia has approved an indictment in the criminal case against the former governor of Kirov Oblast, Nikita Belykh, who is accused of taking large bribes.
The government agency announced this on Thursday, August 3, RIA Novosti reports.
The files have been handed over to Moscow’s Presnensky District Court for consideration on the merits.
The fines for inappropriate conduct by tourists in Venice have been stiffened
Venice’s authorities have stiffened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
From now on, they will issue a fine of 200 euros for walking around the city in a bathing suit or bare-chested.
Those who set up a picnic in a public place or go for a bicycle ride in pedestrian areas will be forced to pay 100 euros, TASS reports, with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
Additionally, it is mentioned that the authorities specify a fine of 400 euros for graffiti on monuments and 25 euros for littering.
Tourists will be informed of the need to follow the rules of conduct by means of a special awareness campaign, #EnjoyRespectVenezia, on social networks, and also through announcements and banners on the city council’s website, on billboards, and in places with the greatest concentration of tourists.
The awareness campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice’s advisor for tourism, Paola Mar, data on fines will be sent to the embassies of the home countries of the violators in order to warn their fellow citizens against similar mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is thought of like a beach”, she noted.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, restrictions on the number of tourists visiting the city’s center are already successfully working.
Instead of the 100,000 people wanting to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the event site.
Furthermore, a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been put in place.
In the first half of 2017, State Border Guard Service officers detained 272 illegals on the border with EU countries; in total, 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
The State Border Guard Service reported this.
Three hundred and fourteen of them were detained for illegally crossing the border, and the rest for violating residency regulations for foreigners living in Ukraine and for other offences.
The largest figure: 717 illegal migrants were detained on the border with Moldova.
Two hundred and seventy-two illegals were detained on the border with EU countries, the majority of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania.
According to statistics, it is primarily citizens of Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, and Armenia who are among the detained illegal migrants.
In addition to this, more than 2 thousand potential illegal migrants were refused entry into Ukraine.
Let us remember that the EU found an unusual method for getting rid of migrants.
Jazz at Skolkovo: experimentation and improvisation
The program for the second Skolkovo Jazz Science festival, which will take place on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Visitors can expect performances by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive installations, and other musical and intellectual activities.
The organizers promise that the venue will become an area for improvisation and a space for demonstrating new creative possibilities.
“Festival visitors will be able to delve into the world of experimental media technology and discover how innovations in science are turning into new tools of collaboration with art”, Yelena Zelentsova, Vice President of the Skolkovo Foundation, described as the focus of the forum.
There are more than a few stars among the Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 participants, including Igor Butman’s Moscow Jazz Orchestra, which will perform a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts and it is no accident that they were connected, the people’s artist explained to Izvestia.
Jazz musicians value experimentation and improvisation as highly as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be a performance by Azekel, a British citizen of Nigerian descent, who is known for both his own body of work and for his collaborative work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are eagerly awaiting the first performance in Russia by the five-time Grammy nominated pianist, Christian Sands (USA), with his trio.
One of the best academic chamber orchestras, Musica Viva, will try its hand in a new format, under the direction of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of pianist Yury Favorin.
The Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer, and marimba player, Lev Slepner, will demonstrate a fusion of jazz, ethnic, and electronic music, as well as academic traditions.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set by Sergei Kuryokhin award winner, Anton Maskeliadze.
The experimental artist conducts music and video using gestures: this is how leap motion technology works.
In total, eight musical groups will perform on two festival stages.
Additionally, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones, and art installations, united by the idea of merging music and science.
Visitors will be able to take part in experiments, visit a science buffet, and observe cryogenic ice cream or quicksand, made from cornstarch and water, being created.
In a special vinyl area, it will be possible to purchase records from current jazz performers and representatives of other music genres; while, at the book fair, there will be publications on various subjects, including music, popular science, and biomedical literature.
The Federation Council has relieved Ozerov from the post of committee head
On Wednesday, the Federation Council approved the resignation letter of the chairperson for the Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of this post.
He remains the senator for Khabarovsk Krai.
Ozerov wrote the application requesting to be relieved from his current post last week.
He explained his decision as a requirement of the rotation and owing to his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to resign wasn’t made in the spur of the moment.
Viktor Ozerov has represented the Legislative Assembly of Khabarovsk Krai in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation since 1996.
The senator has led the Committee on Defense and Security since 2001.
Electricity is getting cheaper for both residents and manufacturers in Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electric energy are beginning to pay off.
Starting on September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial users will be reduced by 25%.
The country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service has set indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia, in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation “On amendments to the rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and capacity and the consolidated balance forecast for production and delivery of electric energy (capacity), within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia, for constituent entities of the Russian Federation” (from 17.07.2017, No. 842).
As a consequence, the cost of electric energy for Buryat manufacturers is being reduced by a quarter, which will make life significantly easier for small and medium businesses and individual entrepreneurs.
The republic’s leaders have been knocking on office doors in Moscow for many decades in futile attempts to equalize the region’s tariffs with those of the neighboring Irkutsk region: with its chain of hydroelectric stations on the Angara River that flows from Lake Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
But progress has only started to be made this year.
In March, tariffs on electric energy for the republic’s population were reduced from RUB 4.24/kWh to RUB 3.93/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the decision of the federal government to include Buryatia on the list of territories of wholesale market pricing zones, for which specific aspects of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the time has come for industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt-hour.
But no one is daring to name even a rough date for the downward shift in new tariffs for Buryatia.
Scooter wasn’t frightened by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The group Scooter, a legend of electronic dance music, flew to Crimea unafraid of the threats from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.
“The flight went well, and tomorrow, I will hold a concert”, RIA Novosti quotes the group’s frontman, H.P. Baxxter, as saying.
Earlier, the German publication Bild, with reference to the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Evgeny Enin, reported that the musicians could face up to eight years imprisonment for travelling to Crimea, which Kiev considers as the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter’s performance at the festival in Balaklava, which is called #ZBFest, is planned for August 4.
#ZBFest is put on by the Zolotaya Balka company, in honor of International Champagne Day.
Scooter, founded in 1993, is one of Germany’s most famous groups.
Their last album, “Ace”, came out in 2016.
Besides Scooter, Sergei Galanin and his group SerGa, as well as Garik Sukachev with Brigada S, will also perform as festival guests.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Putin announced that the authorities will not issue instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the issue of gas deliveries to the Far East Petrochemical Company (FEPCO), but that no one will be issuing instructions to either Gazprom or Rosneft.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin replied to Igor Sechin’s request to assist in resolving conflicts that have emerged.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting concerning the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, stated that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for FEPCO put the timetable for the implementation of the project at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
“Gazprom proposes finding gas resources from within Rosneft’s operational perimeter, but we don’t have these types of resources”, Sechin added.
You will recall that Rosneft was asking for permission to use gas from Gazprom’s Kirinskoye field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Far East Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom announced that negotiations on this matter continue, and that “there aren’t any contentious issues”.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
Putin has instructed that payments to victims of the forest fires be dealt with.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed that the financial assistance, which is being allocated to resident-victims of the forest fires and for the construction of new homes, be dealt with.
Today, I would like to hear how work is progressing.
In particular, I am asking for a report on how things stand in terms of compensation paid to affected citizens.
I am hearing some conflicting information.
“This is why I would like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been dispensed”, Putin stated at a meeting with the heads of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of Russian President for the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Meniailo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution, Glavrybvod, Leonid Mikhailik.
They spoke about efforts to clean up the lake.
Then, they showed the fry in an open tank beside a container they had prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released several fry from a net.
Then, he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest of them.
During the trip, the leader also instructed that the environmental situation in Baikal be dealt with and that a road be built on Olkhon Island.
According to Ministry of Construction figures, a certain amount is needed, but allegedly, a different amount has been set aside.
“To be blunt, I want to get to the bottom of what is going on with the financing here”, the Russian leader stressed.
You’ll remember that, during the 2017 forest fires, populated areas in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast were engulfed in flames and homes and outbuildings were destroyed.
Ukraine has suggested sending Russian nationals to prison for illegally crossing the border
Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada has registered a bill according to which Russian nationals could face criminal sanction in the republic for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
As RT television channel reports, the document, registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament, stipulates a three-year prison sentence for citizens of Russia trying to get into the country’s territory illegally.
It is noted that the term of imprisonment can be increased to five years for repeat offenses or for an act committed by a group of individuals.
If, however, the offender has been detained on the border with a weapon, then the period of detention for them will increase to eight years.
Earlier, it was reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians trying to get into Russia outside of the established checkpoints.
Magnit has gone into wholesale
The second largest food retailer in terms of revenue, Magnit, announced the opening of three new format test stores, Magnit-Opt, which are designed for small wholesale purchasing.
Moreover, it will still be possible to purchase goods at retail prices, a company press release states.
These new format stores have opened for business in Krasnodar, Saratov, and Ulyanovsk.
Their product range consists of around 1,500 food and non-food product items.
“This new service will enable companies and business owners to make financially advantageous purchases, and residents to stock up on products: for a week or a month”, Magnit assures.
Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already operating in the small-scale wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched the special program, Lenta Pro: it offered legal entities and independent business owners the ability to make purchases at the big box store’s special checkouts, and receive an invoice for cost accounting and VAT reimbursement.
The project is aimed at the HORECA segment, small retail, and offices.
There will be two new priority social and economic development areas in Russia: Abaza and Novotroitsk.
The corresponding Russian Government Decree will come into force today, August 4.
The borders and types of economic activities of the priority development area in the town of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia have been established.
In the town, which is home to 15,000 people, a special regulatory regime for entrepreneurial activity will be in effect, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment from residents, and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is anticipated that this will attract approximately 2.5 billion rubles of investment into the town, and also that more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of types of economic activities, according to which the Abaza priority development area’s special regulatory regime for entrepreneurial activity will be in effect, includes, for example, crop farming, livestock breeding, and the production of food products, non-alcoholic beverages, and clothing.
So far, the republic’s government has already signed framework agreements for the implementation of 8 investment projects.
There are also plans to reduce the area’s dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, OOO Abakan Mining Company.
In January 2017, regional authorities announced that Khakassia had met all of the Ministry of Economic Development’s conditions to create the priority development area.
The government of Orenburg Oblast also acted in a similar manner.
There, in the town of Novotroitsk, a priority social and economic development area will also be created.
This will make it possible to diversify the economy of the single-industry town and reduce its dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, JSC Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2,300 jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of types of economic activities, according to which the priority development area’s special regulatory regime for business operators will be in effect, includes, for example, freshwater fish farming and the manufacture of feed, medications, and medical materials.
Novotroitsk was the first single-industry town in Orenburg Oblast to receive the priority development area status.
To recap, a priority development area is an economic zone with tax incentives, simplified administrative procedures, and other privileges, which are established to attract investment and improve the lives of the population.
Some of the benefits for residents of a priority development area include the following: a profit tax of no more than 5% during the first five years and no more than 10% in the 5 following years, social security contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, use of the duty-free zone regime, preferential conditions for connecting to various infrastructure facilities, and preferential rates for rent.
Loza called Manson “scum” and threatened to “punch him in the face”
Yury Loza has expressed his indignation at a remark made by American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a “bastard” and “scum”.
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements shouldn’t be invited to Russia.
Furthermore, Loza believes that Manson needs to get “punched in the face” for his words.
You’ll recall that the American artist, infamous for his inflammatory behavior, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, Argumenty Nedeli wrote that domestic producer Josef Prigozhin had commented on Manson’s statement.
In Moscow, a police officer injured a man in the leg while defending against an assault
A police officer shot a party to a fight in Moscow in the leg after that individual came after him with a piece of glass in his hand.
On the evening of August 3, the police station of the Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Yakimanka District received a report about a fight at 46 Mytnaya Street.
“The attending police squad put an end to the lawlessness and separated the parties to the conflict”, RIA Novosti reported, with reference to the press service of the capital’s head office for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
According to the police, when one of the parties to the conflict came after a police officer with a piece of glass, the police officer warned the man several times that he would use his weapon and fired a warning shot.
This didn’t stop the hooligan, whereupon the law enforcement officer shot the man in the leg.
The injured man required hospitalization.
