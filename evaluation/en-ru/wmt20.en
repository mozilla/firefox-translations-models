TV report left badly shaken after sex pest kisses her live on air
A TV reporter has condemned a stranger who pretended to grope her backside then kissed her live on air.
Sara Rivest recoiled at the man's attempted embrace while reporting on a bourbon festival in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday.
She said "Ooohkay," then "That was not appropriate, let's go to the story," as she regained her composure live on TV station WAVE.
The pest has been named as Eric Goodman, with Goodman now charged with misdemeanor harassment with physical contact.
He has been issued a summons to appear in court.
After their encounter, Rivest shared a clip on Twitter, writing: "Hey mister, here's your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!!"
And Rivest appeared on WAVE's evening news bulletin Monday to condemn the man again.
She conceded that people were perfectly entitled to behave foolishly in her shot while she was reporting from a public place.
Rivest added: "But when you put your hands on me or anyone else without their approval, that is wrong."
She said incidents like the one caught on camera are "a violation and all-too-common occurrence."
The reporter said she was annoyed at herself for laughing when the man kissed her, but blamed it on an instantaneous, nervous reaction to the situation.
She continued: "I was shocked, but my nervous laughter does not equate to approval of his actions.
It was an exertion of power over me, a woman - trying to do her job - who couldn't stop him.
This embarrassed me, and it made me feel uncomfortable and powerless."
Rivest went on to share a text from her dad calling the pest a "jerk," which added: "If I had been there, I'd have dropped him."
Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament - Joyce McMillan
Once, long ago, a committee I sat on had some dealings with people from Buckingham Palace; not the Royal Family itself, but a small group of senior officials.
I suppose that even 20 years on, it's a beheading offence to give precise details of what they said on the subject of the Queen's role in the planned official opening of the new Scottish Parliament, on 1 July 1999; but I can say that they were an impressive crew, much more politically savvy about the constitutional nuances of devolution than most UK Government representatives at the time, and much more sharply aware - given their vast experience across the Commonwealth - that political self-determination is one thing, and the role of the monarch as head of state is another.
Amid all the sound, fury, and swings of the constitutional wrecking-ball that have accompanied the latest traumatic episode in Britain's Brexit crisis, one question has therefore been nagging at the back of my mind; the question of what exactly happened on the morning of 28 August, when Jacob Rees-Mogg, as Lord President of the Council, presented himself at Balmoral, where the Queen was on her usual late summer holiday, to seek the royal assent to the exceptional five-week prorogation of Parliament proposed by the Prime Minister.
This is, of course, a mere sub-plot in the wider Brexit drama which reached such an appalling crisis in the Commons on Wednesday night, with the Prime Minister dismissing the unanimous decision of 11 Supreme Court judges as "wrong," inciting warlike attitudes by using terms like "surrender" and "betrayal" in relation to Brexit, and dismissing as "humbug" the fears for their own safety of women MP's - friends and allies of the murdered MP Jo Cox - who are now subjected to a daily barrage of Brexit-related hate mail.
Yet it is a sub-plot worthy of a one-act play in its own right; and perhaps not one of those jolly, reassuring ones in which the Queen is portrayed as an infinitely wise and perceptive old lady, who has seen 13 prime ministers come and go, and will doubtless outlast the 14th.
For the truth is that on that day, the Queen and her advisers seem to have made an error of judgment, of the kind they have almost entirely avoided, in her 67-year reign to date; and arguably a much more serious one than the intervention in the Scottish independence referendum suggested by David Cameron in his memoir, which, after all, amounted to no more than the Queen suggesting people "think carefully" before casting their votes, a phrase which only a dyed-in-the-wool Unionist would interpret as meaning that they should necessarily vote for the status quo.
This time, though, warning bells should have sounded in the royal household as soon as they heard that the new Prime Minister was proposing such a long prorogation in the run-up to the Brexit deadline date; and a couple of quick concerned phone calls from palace to Downing Street should have been enough to persuade the PM to shorten his pre-Queen's Speech prorogation to the usual length of a few days or a week.
To the royal household, after all, past custom and practice is 99 per cent of the law.
So what went wrong?
We will probably never know, or not for decades.
It may be that the Queen and her advisers simply felt that they did not want to question a new government trying to implement a referendum result, however narrow.
It may be that Johnson and Rees-Mogg genuinely caught the Queen off guard, at a holiday period when many key people were not available.
Or it may be, as some republican thinkers would suggest, that the whole idea of the Queen as a wise and moderate sovereign, who always hopes to promote the wellbeing of her subjects, is simply another layer of royalist mythology, disguising an edifice of wealth and inherited privilege which, under stress, will unhesitatingly assist a right-wing government in undermining institutions - Scottish, British or European - that might threaten that traditional power structure.
It is 42 years, after all, since punk poet John Lydon of the Sex Pistols first noisily linked the Queen with the idea of a "fascist regime"; and although the history of postwar Europe strongly suggests that there is no inevitable connection between royalty and reactionary politics, it can be argued that the 1970s punk movement at least tried to open up a conversation about monarchy and democracy, one which the UK has since failed to pursue.
Whatever the truth about the Queen's role in the prorogation, though, this much is clear; that as the current Brexit crisis is testing Britain's unwritten constitution to its limits, and provoking a dangerous moment of open constitutional warfare among government, parliament and the courts, it has also succeeded in undermining the monarch's conventional stabilising role in that constitution, associating her with a rash act that has now been declared unlawful, by a government that commands no parliamentary majority.
The global merchants of democratic instability and breakdown - the Putins and Bannons, with their armies of hate-mongering internet bots - must be delighted by the spectacular progress of their project, over just three years, in one of the world's most stable democracies.
And Scotland, which has not been the primary target of this destabilisation, must now soon be given a second chance to consider its position, in relation to a UK so radically changed by Brexit.
In 1977, Lydon and the Sex Pistols famously warned that "there is no future for you, in England's dreaming."
Yet now, England's fierce dream of a glorious past, filtered through layers of 21st-century lies and delusion, is starting to shape all of our futures on these islands; and we will all have to live in that landscape of dream or nightmare, until we find our own ways - with or without the Queen, and inside or outside the UK - of resisting the lies, rejecting the illusion, and coming together to re-engage with reality of our lives, as citizens of the 21st century.
How much is Kelvin Fletcher paid for Strictly, who is his wife and why did he leave Emmerdale?
FORMER Emmerdale cast member Kelvin Fletcher has swapped the Dales for the dancefloor on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing 2019.
But what do we know about him?
How much is Kelvin Flecther being paid for Strictly Come Dancing?
The father-of-one is said to have been paid something in the region of £25,000 and £40,000 to take part in the 17th series of Strictly Come Dancing.
The Sun previously reported that each celebrity is given a standard £25,000 payment for joining.
For those who stay until the end of October the fee rises to £40,000.
However, his earnings could increase significantly if he makes it to the quarter-finals as he will pocket £60,000.
With Kelvin being a strong competitor there is every possibility he could walk away with £100,000 if he wins the entire competition.
Why did Kelvin Fletcher leave Emmerdale?
Kelvin first joined Emmerdale at the tender age of six-years-old in 1996.
He played the part of Andy Sugden for 20 years, before quitting the role in 2016 for good.
During an appearance on This Morning, the actor opened up about his decision to leave the ITV soap.
Speaking to host Emmon Holmes and Ruth Langsford, he explained: "Twenty years is a long time.
It's been an incredible twenty years.
I am so grateful to Emmerdale.
Throughout that period I have always had a real sense of fulfillment and purpose."
He added: "What started out as a hobby at six years old - I was then able to do something like that every day on a professional platform on one of the country's greatest shows.
I have been extremely lucky.
Looking back over 20 years it has been a rollercoaster and for me it's give me passion to leave and continue."
Wollstonecraft's only house for sale going under the hammer
The north shore housing market is in the grip of a stock shortage, especially in the popular suburb of Wollstonecraft.
According to realestate.com.au, there are just 11 properties currently on the market.
Only one of them is a house, and by this time tomorrow it will likely be sold.
The four-bedroom house at 18 Tryon Ave , is scheduled to go under the hammer at 2pm (Saturday, September 28), and will be open for inspection and registration from 1.15pm.
It has a price guide of $2.75 million.
David Hill, of Raine&Horne HM Group, said the home was located in the only street on the Wollstonecraft peninsula that has no conservation restrictions.
This offers plenty of opportunities for a major renovation or knockdown/rebuild (subject to council approval).
"It's very rare for this type of thing to come up," he said.
The property has a lot of potential and we have had a lot of interest.
He said almost 100 groups had seen the property in the lead up to tomorrow's auction.
According to CoreLogic, there hasn't been a house sale in Tryon Ave since 2015.
This property hasn't changed hands since 1987.
The four-bedroom, full-brick home offers plenty of space and is directly opposite Badangi Reserve.
It is also within walking distance of Wollstonecraft Station, Berry Island Reserve and the harbour foreshores.
Drug-driving crashes double in just five years as RAC accuses government of 'complacency'
Number of road accidents caused by drug-driving more than doubled in 5 years
DfT said 1,321 crashes were caused by drivers under influence of drugs last year
RAC said statistics worrying, accused the Government of complacency
The number of road accidents caused by drug-driving has more than doubled in five years.
There were 1,321 crashes caused by drivers under the influence of drugs last year, compared to 594 in 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) said on Thursday.
Worse, drugs were a factor in 80 road deaths last year - compared to just 31 six years ago.
The RAC Foundation said the statistics are 'worrying', and it has accused the Government of complacency over road safety.
Motorway deaths also rose despite moves to make them safer, with 107 fatalities last year - up eight per cent on 2017.
Motoring groups fear the removal of hard shoulders on so-called 'smart motorways' where stricken drivers have no choice but to stop in 'live' lanes.
They have emergency lay-bys every 1.5 miles instead.
It is not clear how many of the recorded deaths were on smart motorways, which are to be renamed 'digital roads' and currently account for at least 416 miles of Britain's motorways.
That is set to almost double to 788 miles by April 2025 under the Government's road strategy.
By contrast, deaths on rural roads were down three per cent last year from the year before.
And the DfT statistics suggest that tougher penalties on mobile phone use are working.
Although the number of road deaths caused by using handsets rose from 32 in 2016 to 33 in 2017, it fell to 25 last year.
New laws against using a mobile phone behind the wheel were introduced in 2017 after a Daily Mail campaign.
The number of accidents also decreased, from 478 in 2016 to 431 in 2017 and 423 last year.
RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said: 'Of particular concern are the rises in fatalities among older age groups and a spike in motorway fatalities.
Some worrying trends are emerging here that require immediate investigation, to understand the reasons for these increases and what can be done to reduce them.
'In addition, the Government's data suggests an increase in motorway collisions where at least one driver has been under the influence of illegal drugs.'
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'We are progressing more than 70 different measures to help improve safety, for everyone from infants in car seats to those with years of driving experience.
I have also asked the Department to urgently look at technological interventions to help reduce the number of young drivers killed."
African Cooperation On Peace 'Increasingly Strong', Security Council Told
African countries are building increasingly strong partnerships for advancing peace and security, as well as inclusive sustainable development across the continent, the Security Council heard on Thursday, during a briefing by the UN Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet, Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti.
Ms. Viotti recognized the African Union and Member States' success in achieving important milestones in their pursuit for higher effectiveness, self-reliance and cooperation, and welcomed the work of the African Union Mediation Support Unit and the FemWise Network of African Women in Conflict Prevention and Mediation, which are, she said, "boosting capacity to defuse crises and making such efforts more inclusive."
Progress evident at regional and country level
Ms. Viotti went on to outline some of the progress being made in certain African countries, such as the peace talks, led by the African Union, in the Central African Republic which led a Political Agreement which is being overseen by the UN; the signing of a Constitutional Declaration in Sudan, which has allowed for the establishment of a civilian-led government, following efforts led by Ethiopia and the African Union (AU), with UN support; and free and fair elections in Madagascar, supported by the Southern Africa Development Community, the African Union, and UN.
Cooperation between the UN, African Union and other partners in the area of elections is growing, said Ms. Viotti, citing visits organized by the UN Office for West Africa to several countries, ahead of legislative or presidential elections, over the last two years.
The UN and AU, she continued, are cooperating closely to ensure that the voices of women and youth are integral to peace processes, and both organizations have youth envoys and strategies, acting as advocates and agents of change.
More effective support needed from international community
Despite the many examples of progress, Ms. Viotti declared that the international community needs to do much more to support African efforts.
For example, more predictable, flexible and sustainable financing for African Union-led peace support operations is needed; more political will and resources for peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts; and active support for the AU Initiative on Silencing the Guns.
"Building partnerships and harnessing their power requires long-term vision and commitment," Ms. Viotti told the Security Council, adding that the Secretary-General is looking forward to "even greater partnership and collaboration, enabling the African Union to achieve its 2063 vision of equitable, people-centred transformation and lasting peace and security."
Belfast High Court dismisses no-deal Brexit case
The Court of Appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the UK government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process.
Three applicants appealed against a Belfast High Court judgment that rejected their challenge against the UK government's handling of the Brexit process.
One of the applicants was high-profile victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.
It comes after the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks.
The three-judge Court of Appeal, led by the region's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, gave their judgment on Friday morning.
The three challenges focused on various aspects of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
One that argued the Government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process was previously dismissed by the High Court.
During the appeal hearing last week, Mr McCord's barrister Ronan Lavery QC told the court that if a Brexit extension could not be secured by the government in the absence of a deal, then the default position should be halting Brexit - through the revocation of Article 50 - rather than exiting with no deal.
Mr McCord, who was not at court due to ill health, said he would study the Belfast Court of Appeal judgment with his lawyer.
"I, along with many other people, believe that it will affect the peace process," he said.
I hope I am proven wrong.
We did not take this case to alarm people, it is what I believe in.
"It would be nice if in the coming years people can come across and say: "Look Raymond, you were wrong."
It did not affect the peace process.
I don't want it to affect the peace process.
I don't want people to go through what my family and members of other families have went through.
I respect the judgment of the Appeal Court in every way, I believe the judges sitting there are amongst the best judges in the UK.
I have to respect their judgment.
However, it is a fear I have that the peace process will be affected."
Shirley Ballas health: Strictly star to remove breast implants to reduce cancer risk
Head judge of Strictly Come Dancing, Shirley Ballas, 59, announced that she will be having her breast implants removed after several cancer diagnoses in her family.
Shirley's mother and aunt both have cancer and as such she made the decision to remove her implants to reduce her risk.
According to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is a possible association between breast implants and the development of breast-implant associated anapaestic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), an uncommon cancer of the immune system.
The FDA believes that women with breast implants that have textured surfaces have a very low but increased risk of developing BIA-ALCL.
However, FDA did note that it doesn't necessarily mean that implant cause it and further research is need to understand the relationship between the condition and breast implants.
Shirley had received a health warning following a mammogram and subsequently made the brave decision to remove her implants.
Speaking to The Sun, Shirley was told "there's no guarantee that we can ever really see behind the back of the implants," which made her realise it could be difficult for doctors to detect any cancers.
Shirley said: "I'm scheduled for the operation on Tuesday, October 29th."
My doctor says I have recuperation of a week, but I want to do Strictly on the Saturday night.
Joking that "it's not like I have to dance and do the cha cha cha or the samba."
I have spoke to the BBC and they have been very, very supportive.
They said you have to do what you feel most comfortable for your health.
Despite the FDA announcing more research is needed on the subject of implants and its correlation to breast cancer, Shirley has decided not to take any chances and believes it has impacted her health negatively.
There are rumours that the scar tissues cause chronic fatigue which I have suffered with even over the last year.
Usually I don't get tired and I'm like an Energizer bunny.
But if they take out the scar tissue it would involve bigger surgery and perhaps a reconstruction.
But I don't want any implants in.
I don't want any foreign bodies in my body.
Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, a change in the size or shape of the breast, a dimpling of the skin or thickening in the breast tissue, an inverted nipple, a rash on the nipple, discharge, or a swelling in the armpit.
If you suspect you or anyone you may know might have these signs it's imperative to speak with your GP who will recommend you to a specialist if needs be.
'Grey's Anatomy' Season 16 debuted and people have feelings
The hit ABC drama debuted it's new season Thursday night and it was a lot.
From Amelia Shepherd (played by Caterina Scorsone) using her date with Atticus Lincoln a.k.a. Dr. Link (Chris Carmack) to float the idea of a three-way, to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) facing the threat of losing her medical license, there was plenty of "OMG" moments.
But what seemed to really mess up social media was the revelation that Amelia might be pregnant -- which of course was not the kind of threesome she was envisioning.
"Omg the new episode of grey's anatomy... amelia... sweetie," one person tweeted.
Character Jo Karev (Camilla Luddington) also got some major support from husband Alex (Justin Chambers) after she checked into a psychiatric facility for 30 days to deal with her issues.
He dropped to one knee and proposed to her all over again.
"Marry me again, please," Alex said.
No. of women in science field far from satisfactory; need to increase participation: President Kovind
President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the participation of women in the field of science in the country is far from satisfactory and steps need to be taken to ensure greater involvement of girl students in the area.
In his address on the 78th foundation day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), he said achievements in the field of science and technology will become more wholesome and desirable if there is a greater participation of girl students and of women in this area.
In this context, he said Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission M Vanitha and Mission Director Ritu Karidhal have become household names.
We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology.
"When this happens, our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable," the President said.
"None of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children," he added.
Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present at the event.
Mr Kovind called upon the scientific community to take calculated risk.
There, he said, lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations.
He said the academic, scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups.
Mr Vardhan also presented the President a Fuel Cell Prototype developed by CSIR labs.
This is the first indigenous prototype and the fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity.
Fast broadband roll-out held up by legal requirement on landlords
Thousands of central London residents are being "locked out" of the quickest broadband by a legal requirement for landlords to give permission before fibre can be installed.
Bosses at Openreach, the firm responsible for linking up homes to fibre networks capable of supporting "ultrafast" broadband, say they face huge obstacles in securing so-called "wayleave" agreements that give them the right to enter apartment or office blocks.
The problem is most acute in the City where complex layers of foreign ownership have made it hard to identify who the freeholders are, resulting in years of costly delay.
Figures from Openreach suggest it has been unable to gain consent from the owners of 848 high-rise buildings - containing 9,941 residential or business premises - in the City alone.
Affected residents have spoken of their frustration at being left with slow internet speeds in the heart of the Square Mile.
Civil servant Tim Figures, who lives in an apartment near the Gherkin tower, said he can access only "basic" broadband services despite lobbying for more than a year for fibre to be installed.
It means it can take up to an hour to download a single TV episode and uploading files is "incredibly slow."
With fibre, downloading an entire HD film takes a few minutes.
The 48-year-old said: "Working from home can cause huge problems if I need to do anything beyond a basic email."
Mr Figures said the managing agent of his building had approached the freeholder about access for Openreach but it had refused to sign a wayleave agreement.
He added: "It's incredibly frustrating, we're just stuck in this legal limbo."
The freeholder doesn't have to pay anything, there is no liability, all they have to do is sign an agreement giving Openreach permission to lay cables.
Openreach boss Chris Selly said he wants a change in the law to give the company the same legal rights to enter as gas, electricity and water suppliers.
Kim Mears, Openreach's head of strategic infrastructure development, said the firm had been able to access only 44 per cent of City buildings, adding: "It's a real tortuous drawn-out process."
Joker is chilling, unnerving and absolutely brilliant
Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins.
Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen.
What transpires on screen is chilling, unnerving, completely compelling, anxiety-inducing, sleep-disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.
Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, becomes the homicidal clown we're familiar with, and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far.
The balancing act is truly engaging.
Phoenix gives the performance of the year here, but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film.
This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore, it is completely its own beast, and that is precisely why it works so well; there is no format, there is no convention and there are no rules.
You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll, but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow.
Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule
Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.
Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.
Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.
Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.
Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.
Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.
But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.
International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.
Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.
The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.
But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.
In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.
The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.
An agreement formalizing public access to state-owned lands has been a good deal for the two Idaho agencies involved as well as hunters, anglers and recreationists, state officials said Thursday.
The Idaho Department of Lands and Idaho Department of Fish and Game said that both sides are benefiting from the 2018 agreement.
Fish and Game through fees it collects from hunters and anglers is paying the Lands Department $580,000 annually, with about a fourth of that in law enforcement patrols.
The agreement involves access to about 3,750 square miles (9,700 square kilometers) of Idaho endowment lands.
Idaho received endowment lands in 1890 when it became a state.
Most of the money is generated through logging.
The lands have always been open to the public, but state officials say the agreement has increased awareness that they are accessible to hunters, anglers and others.
"And the state has been very open that they're welcome there," said Roger Phillips, spokesman for Fish and Game.
Phillips and Bill Haagenson, an administrator at the Lands Department, said it's difficult to quantify how many visitors are heading for state lands following the agreement.
But anecdotally, each said, the numbers appear to be growing.
"I think we can say that recreation use on endowment lands has been and continues to increase," Haagenson said.
As our population grows, we're seeing more recreation.
Miscreants or public lands slobs occasionally show up, but state officials say most visitors have been respectful and responsible.
About 96 percent of endowment lands are accessible by foot or boat.
Maps of accessible endowment lands are available on Fish and Game's website.
There are also smartphone apps available that show state, federal and private lands while a person moves across the landscape.
That's particularly useful for hunters, said Phillips, who uses an app that turns the screen blue for state land.
"If you're standing in that blue patch, you know you're in pretty good shape," he said.
Because the Idaho Constitution requires state lands to be used to generate money, there was some concern individuals or companies could pay to lease state lands, cutting off public access.
Such a request is still possible.
A decision on that would be up to the Idaho Land Board, comprised of Republican Gov. Brad Little and four other statewide elected officials, who manage endowment lands and direct the Lands Department.
The agreement between the Lands Department and Fish and Game "gives the board another piece of information to consider should an application for use come in," Haagenson said.
Idaho endowment lands are somewhat scattered, the state having received 1-mile (2.6-kilometer) square sections when it became a state.
Over the years, exchanges or sales left the current configuration with some remaining isolated sections, but many others accumulated into blocks of sections, particularly in northern and central Idaho.
"There's a lot of good timberland in central Idaho that provides really good wildlife habitat," Phillips said.
A lot of that is intertwined with national forest land.
Holiday Inn Delhi Aerocity Posh Delhi Hotel To Be Seized In Case Against Deepak Talwar
The value of Holiday Inn is Rs 127 crore.
Deepak Talwar is currently in judicial custody
A special PMLA authority has confirmed the attachment of hotel Holiday Inn, worth over Rs 127 crore, located in the upscale Aerocity area in the national capital in connection with a money laundering case against alleged aviation lobbyist Deepak Talwar, the Enforcement Directorate said on Friday.
The attachment order, issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 28, has been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on September 19, the agency said in a statement.
The agency, with the approval obtained from the authority, will now be able to seize the hotel, a senior official said.
The lobbyist was deported from Dubai in January and arrested by the agency in a PMLA case booked against him and others.
The proceeds of crime allegedly generated by Deepak Talwar, from kickbacks received in lieu of securing favourable air traffic rights, were integrated in a company Wave Hospitality Private Limited, the agency said.
It alleged that this company was "beneficially owned and controlled" by Deepak Talwar in the name of his son, Aditya Talwar.
This alleged tainted money was used to construct hotel Holiday Inn, next to the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the ED charged.
The posh hotel boasts of some of the most expensive boarding and dining facilities in the Aerocity complex that was constructed few years ago for international and domestic air passengers transiting through Delhi.
The agency had earlier said that Deepak Talwar "illegally engaged in liasoning/lobbying with politicians, ministers and other public servants and officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation for airlines such as Emirates, Air Arabia and Qatar Airways for securing undue benefits for them" during the tenure of the UPA government.
"He (Talwar) illegally managed to secure favourable traffic rights for these airlines during 2008-09 at the cost of national carrier, Air India," the agency said.
Investigation revealed that in lieu of securing favourable traffic rights, these airlines made payments to the tune of Rs 272 crore to Talwar during 2008-09, it said.
"It has been revealed that Talwar created a web of entities owned by him and his family members in India and international offshore havens to launder proceeds of crime of Rs 272 crore received from foreign airlines," ED had said.
"Part of these payments were made to an account in Bank of Singapore, belonging to a company Asiafield Limited registered in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially owned by Deepak Talwar," it added.
Wells Fargo taps BNY Mellon's Charles Scharf as CEO
Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday, the lender's third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago.
Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly.
Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.
Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarnished reputation following the scandal.
Internal and regulatory probes since the scandal have uncovered other issues in each of the bank's primary businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.
Wells Fargo's board has been shuffled many times since the scandal, with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016.
Most recently, Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N).
Before joining the custodian bank, he held the top job at Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest payment network.
Separately, BNY Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis.
The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards which were unvested as of Thursday.
KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells Fargo's CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.
"Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place," Kleinhanzl said.
Scharf, 54, started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks.
He was named Dimon's assistant six months into the job at Commercial Credit, according to an alumni magazine for the NYU stern business school.
Scharf will start in his new role next month, Wells Fargo said in a statement.
"He moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
The lender's board had considered keeping Parker as CEO on a permanent basis even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June.
Wells Fargo said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018.
Regulatory filings showed that Scharf's total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million.
Sloan's total compensation for the year was $18.4 million.
Shares of Wells Fargo were up nearly 3.2% at $50.44 in premarket trading.

Parents Arrested In Suspicious Death Of 4-Year-Old Palmdale Boy Noah Cuatro - CBS Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The parents of 4-year-old Palmdale boy Noah Cuatro who died in July under suspicious circumstances were arrested Thursday, officials confirmed.
Jose Cuatro and Ursula Juarez were arrested for the murder of their son, Noah, on September 26, 2019, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Dept. announced.
The two were booked at Palmdale Sheriff's Station and a search warrant was served at their residence in an attempt to recover any additional evidence related to Noah's murder.
Noah had been ordered by a court back in May to be removed from his parents' custody over concerns about abuse.
He was never removed from the home and placed in foster care and on the afternoon of July 5, Noah's parents called 911 to report that he was drowning in a pool at an apartment complex in the 1200 block of East Avenue S, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department reports.
Noah was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital.
He died the following morning, on July 6.
Hospital staff found signs of trauma on Noah's body and determined there were issues with his parents' explanation for his cause of death.
Noah's three siblings had since been removed from the home and the sheriff's department launched an investigation.
DCFS had previously investigated several reports of abuse in Noah's home.
Noah's maternal great-grandmother Eva Hernandez told CBSLA that he was in and out of foster care his entire life.
"DCFS has blood on its hands," said Hernandez's attorney Brian Claypool.
Even though we're talking today about the arrest of his parents, we will be back some point in the future to hold that agency accountable for the death of this little boy.
In 2016, according to the Times, Noah was removed from the home and placed in foster care for two years.
He was returned to his parents' custody in November 2018.
Hernandez said she often cared for her great-grandson.
"He begged me, "grandma, let me stay, don't do this to me, don't send me back,"" Hernandez said.
It's hard because I remember every word he used to tell me.
Noah's parents are being held on $1 million bail each and are due in court Monday, Sept.
WeWork's Neumann voted to oust himself as CEO after failed IPO
When WeWork's directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The vote by Neumann, who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded, was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer, Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group, the sources said.
Neumann's downfall came after WeWork's parent, We Company, spent months preparing for an initial public offering, only to have to postpone its plans last week, as estimates of its value fell by tens of billions of dollars amid investor concerns about its corporate governance under Neumann, 40, and its ability to generate a profit.
The falling estimates came as a shock to Son, who had plowed more than $10 billion into WeWork, the last investment at a $47 billion valuation, according to three people familiar with the matter.
At that level, WeWork was the world's fourth-most valuable private startup, according to data firm CB Insights.
By the time the IPO was pulled, estimates of WeWork's value had come down as low as $10 billion.
By last weekend, some WeWork directors started to lay the groundwork for Neumann's departure, according to a source familiar with the seven-member board's deliberations.
The notion would have been unthinkable only a few months ago, with the WeWork brand strongly tied to the flamboyant, freewheeling Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that his company's mission was to "elevate the world's consciousness."
The substance of the message to Neumann from them: "Listen, this IPO has gotten distracted by you," the source said.
Neumann decided to back the management changes because he became convinced they were in the best interest of the company, according to a person close to him.
Neumann owns about a quarter of WeWork, sources have previously said, tying much of his wealth to the company.
WeWork has not disclosed what percentage of the company he owns.
Neumann did not respond to calls and emails requesting an interview.
SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment.
Rugby World Cup 2019: Warren Gatland announces Wales line-up for Australia showdown
Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team for Wales' Pool D showdown against Australia, with Alun Wyn Jones set to become the country's most-capped player when he leads his side out in Tokyo.
The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap, breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.
Gatland has placed his faith in the starting XV that secured a 43-14 victory over Georgia four days ago, this despite the knocks suffered by centre Hadleigh Parkes and hooker Ken Owens.
There is one switch among the replacements, with Ospreys centre Owen Watkin taking over from Leigh Halfpenny.
Gatland's side features nine survivors from Wales' narrow win against the Wallabies last November.
There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game.
And flanker Aaron Shingler will again provide second-row bench cover for starting locks Jake Ball and Alun Wyn Jones.
Sunday's clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D, setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina.
Should Australia claim victory - in what would make for their 14th win from the last 15 meetings between these two sides - Gatland's men could find themselves on a collision course for a last-eight encounter with England.
Buy a classic Guardian photograph: Myanmar by David Levene
In 2016, Guardian photographer David Levene and architecture critic Oliver Wainwright visited Yangon to document its changing face, amid huge political upheaval and a flood of foreign investment.
Its crumbling British colonial architecture, and street life in particular, provided a rich source of stories and images.
Here, a young man sells fruit at a roadside stall beneath a rudimentary striplight (Wainwright is pictured just beyond him, wearing a blue T-shirt).
"There was a specific time at the end of the day, when daylight was failing and the streetlights came on, when everything seemed to glow," says Levene.
World Cup is shop window that will improve team, says Canada captain
Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the "shop window" and ultimately help improve the team in the long run.
The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-times world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe.
Ardron, one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations.
"We're at the World Cup to play against the best (and)... for this game (against Italy) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard," Ardron said.
(Against New Zealand) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of.
For a lot of guys this is a shop window and hopefully some of them can put on a hell of a performance out there and get a contract.
That would be a win for us.
Wins on the field may be few and far between for tier-two nations at the tournament, such as Uruguay's victory over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday.
The Italians, however, were in no mood to allow a second shock within the space of 24 hours and demonstrated the benefits of having a team comprised of full-time professionals playing regular test matches.
Canada coach Kingsley Jones, however, said Thursday's performance had been a major step up for his side, which has struggled internationally for a number of years and was the last to qualify for the tournament.
The advent of Major League Rugby (MLR) in North America launched two years ago, however, is an important development in bridging the gap between tier-one and tier-two nations and for the development of players in Canada and the United States, he said.
It was a big reality check when I came to Canada just how difficult it was to get the players together.
"They all held down day jobs," said Jones.
But I think the MLR is a lifeline for Canada and the United States.
It's a pathway for players and coaches.
Jones said there were 51 Canadians contracted to MLR clubs last season.
Less than 18 months ago, more than 40 were working other jobs.
"That's a big step in the right direction," he said.
MLR still has a way to go.
It's still in its infancy but it is certainly a pathway into the top levels.
In the long term I'm sure it will get up to speed and be a good competitive competition, so that is critical.

Giriraj Singh Says Rising Population Like Second Stage Cancer
Giriraj Singh said those opposed to population control bring religion into the debate (File)
Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Friday likened India's burgeoning population to "second stage cancer" and called for a stringent legislation to control it, saying that if not controlled then it will go into the fourth stage and become incurable.
Speaking at a seminar on population control, Mr Singh, a hardline leader of the BJP, said it is necessary to enact a stringent law and those who breach it should face punishments like revocation of their voting rights and economic curbs irrespective of their religions.
He said those opposed to measures for controlling population bring religion into the debate.
"Rising population has become like a second stage cancer.
It not controlled, this ailment will go into the fourth stage and become incurable," Mr Singh said.
Like China, India should bring a stringent law, he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had advocated measures to control population while expressing concern over its "explosive growth."
Keeping one's family is also an act of patriotism, he had added.
Mr Singh said a people's movement is needed to push for a legislation on population control, adding that he will undertake such a yatra, which will be held from Meerut to Delhi, during October 11-13.
House blocks Trump national emergency over border, setting up veto
President Donald Trump speaks while participating in a tour of border wall prototypes.
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president.
Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it.
The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.
Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president.
He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.
Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February.
His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers.
A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.
Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death
Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air, a study has found.
It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies' lives.
Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about.
"You live where you live and you can't avoid pollution day in day out," she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health.
"If you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions," she added.
A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues, including lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birthweight.
The latest study, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid.
Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012.
The team divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas, each containing approximately 1,500 residents, and looked at the annual death rates for babies up to one-year-old, together with the average annual levels for three pollutants.
These were particulate matter known as PM10, which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction.
For each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth.
Once factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air.
The results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO2, 4% worse for PM10 and 19% worse for SO2.
Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby's first 28 days.
The study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas.
It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution.
Prof Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people.
She said the latest study had a number of limitations.
It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance - meaning the babies' true exposure was not captured.
The study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking.
Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.
"It is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis," said Toledano.
Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.
"The evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha's study, which suggests babies born in the UK's most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government," she said.
A second study found that exposure to PM10 from traffic during pregnancy and children's early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old - although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15.
Woods said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs.
"Both these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society - the very young," she said.
EU & Japan strike "connectivity" deal to link Asia & to counter China's new Silk Road - RT Business News
The European Union has included Japan in its Asia "connectivity" plan, signing a landmark deal to coordinate transport, energy and digital projects amid concerns over China's dominance in infrastructure funding.
The agreement formally seals Japan's engagement in the new EU-Asia connectivity plan and was signed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the Europa Connectivity Forum in Brussels on Friday.
"Whether it be a single road or a single port, when the EU and Japan undertake something, we are able to build sustainable, rules-based connectivity from the Indo-Pacific to the Western Balkans and Africa," Abe told reporters ahead of the signing ceremony.
EU officials have turned to Japan in an apparent move to evade attracting Chinese financing, fearing what they see as China's dominance in infrastructure building across Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
Since 2013, China funded the construction of bridges, roads and tunnels across more than 60 countries under its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which aims to build a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
"The sea route that leads to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic must be open," Abe said, emphasizing the deal's signatories" aim to prevent China-financed projects from dominating EU-Asia transport links.
"Japan and the EU endeavor to ensure synergies and complementarity between their respective cooperation on connectivity and quality infrastructure with partner third countries and coordinate action, notably in the regions of the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Indo-Pacific, as well as in Africa," the bilateral document states.
The deal is also to ensure "transparent procurement practices," as well as "free, open, fair, non-discriminatory and predictable regional and international trade and investment."
It will be backed by a €60 billion ($65.48 billion) EU guarantee fund, development banks and private investors.
The signatories promised to pay "utmost attention" to the sides" "fiscal capacity and debt-sustainability."
Jean-Claude Juncker promised to help build infrastructure "without mountains of debt" or a reliance "on a single country."
Although not all the money distributed under the deal will be spent in Asia, the EU's new agenda makes spending on infrastructure links with Asia official EU policy, which also involves the bloc's common budget.
The two-day Europa Connectivity Forum is a multi-nation convention which aims to enforce ties between governments, financial institutions and private sectors, across Europe and beyond.
This year's Forum, held under the theme "EU-Asia Connectivity: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future," is focused on strengthening cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region.
Muslim Woman Says Company Didn't Hire Her As She Wanted To Pray At Work
Shahin Indorewala is suing the firm, claiming that she was discriminated against.
Shahin Indorewala had a job working with children with autism, but she wanted to gain more experience in marketing.
So she applied to Fast Trak Management, a small company that bills itself as "the number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area."
Now, Indorewala is suing the company, claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray.
In a lawsuit filed in US District Court on Tuesday, Indorewala said she was "humiliated" by Fast Trak's CEO mocking her Muslim beliefs.
The CEO, Ramses Gavilondo, disputes her version of events, saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala's behalf, held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak's Falls Church office on Wednesday, when CAIR labeled Fast Trak "a company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith."
In a video of the news conference, Indorewala said that her first interview went well, and that she was asked to return for a second interview.
At that interview, Indorewala said, an assistant manager at Fast Trak told her that the company offers a long lunch break.
Indorewala asked if she could take a shorter lunch break, so she could take two five-minute breaks during the workday to pray.
She promptly ended the interview.
She said, 'That's not going to work.
We have fixed hours here,' " Indorewala said.
According to the lawsuit, the assistant manager then allegedly walked with Indorewala to Gavilondo, and said that the job's hours wouldn't work for Indorewala.
Indorewala said she then explained to Gavilondo that she prays five times a day.
At that point, Indorewala says, Gavilondo pointed to her headscarf and made mocking comments about religion.
"Am I really being made fun of for my religion in public in what's supposed to be a professional workplace? . . .
Clearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion," Indorewala said at the news conference.
That was it.
I just kind of quietly left the office.
I didn't want to create a scene or anything, but I was pretty hurt and pretty embarrassed.
Reached by phone on Thursday, Gavilondo said he didn't reject Indorewala's application; instead, he said, she was the one who decided she did not want the job.
Someone came for an interview.
They didn't want to work here. . . .
"It's like me going to a store to buy Kit-Kats, and then I don't want to eat the Kit-Kats," he said.
He said he recalled that Indorewala brought up her Muslim faith, but he did not specifically recall her request for five-minute prayer breaks during the day.
And he said he had not made fun of her hijab: "I'm not a fashion expert.
People can wear whatever they want."
Oil prices head for weekly loss as supply fears wane
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday but were heading for a weekly loss on a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output, while investors also worried about global crude demand amid slowing Chinese economic growth.
During a volatile session, Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost 32 cents to $62.42 a barrel by 11:21 a.m.
EDT (1521 GMT), after dropping to a session low of $60.76 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 3 cents to $56.44 a barrel, after falling to $54.75 a barrel.
Brent was on track to fall nearly 3% for the week, its biggest weekly loss since early August, while WTI was set to fall 2.8%.
Earlier in the session, futures fell after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for talks.
However, prices pared losses after U.S. President Donald Trump then said he had refused the request by Tehran.
"We've really been following headline to headline," said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago.
Crude futures were also earlier hit by a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Brent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept. 14, which initially halved the kingdom's production.
Sources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.
Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online.
"The risk premium is deflating further," said Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it might cut its estimates for global oil demand for 2019 and 2020 should the global economy weaken further.
Key oil freight rates from the Middle East to Asia rocketed as much as 28% on Friday in the global oil shipping market, spooked by U.S. sanctions on units of China's COSCO for alleged involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran.
The COSCO vessels account for about 7.5% of the world's fleet of supertankers, Refinitiv data showed.
Emerging details connected to the impeachment inquiry into Trump also helped to dent demand sentiment, analysts said.
"An impeachment would add to the uncertainty of the U.S. economy," Flynn said.
Brexit news: Reckless stuns BBC QT with brilliant point on Remainers' bid to halt EU exit
The Member of the National Assembly for South Wales East made the point during Thursday's broadcast from Cardiff.
His argument was made in response to whether the tide of opposition would be the same if the referendum had gone in favour of Remain.
He said: "In a democracy, where laws are made and properly interpreted of course, we should obey the law.
The problem we now have is that people voted to leave the EU were told they were being given the decision, and the Government would implement what they decided.
But, Brexit is being blocked by people who don't like Brexit, by people voted Remain and think their views are greater than the majority who voted to leave.
We're seeing in parliament the procedures of the House of Commons abused.
We have had someone in the chair who has allowed his own personal preference for remain to influence how he assesses and frankly breaks the standing orders.
Fiona Bruce interrupted Mr Reckless and said: "John Bercow has always said he doesn't have a preference."
To this the audience burst into laughter with Mr Reckless laughing with them.
He replied: "If you believed that you'd believe anything."
He says the referendum was misguided and therefore he's pleased that the powers are being pushed back to parliament because the 52 percent shouldn't be able to enjoy 100 percent of their victory.
He thinks parliament should ensure we stay in the customs union and the EEA.
Now, would he be saying this if it was the other way around?
Would he be saying we should leave the EU and join the EEA to counter that 48 percent?
No, of course he wouldn't.
He said that election was just a snapchat of public opinion.
To this the crowd burst into applause and cheered Mr Reckless.
Ms Bruce attempted to shout over the audience to correct Mr Reckless, she said: "He didn't sit as one of the eleven judges though Mark."
The former Conservative Party MP countered Ms Bruce's comments and went into detail on Lord Sumption having sat as one of the judges on Gina Miller's previous case.
He said: "That was the case where he dismissed the tried and tested rules of statutory interoperation."
Ms Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who filed one of two appeals against the English high court's decision that the prorogation was "purely political" and not a matter for the courts.
She was consequently successful in her appeal, along with the previous victory during an appeal when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 in 2017.
Kylie Jenner tweets she's 'really sick' and can't make Paris Fashion Week
Reality television star, makeup mogul and self-made billionaire Kylie Jenner is sick and won't be in Paris for Friday's Balmain runway show and debut of her cosmetics collaboration with the French fashion house's creative director Olivier Rousteing, she announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning.
"Unfortunately I'm really sick and unable to travel," read the post in part, "I'm heartbroken to be missing this show, but I know that my amazing team, and my friends who are in town for the event, will help me be there in spirit. ..."
She ended by urging her social media followers to join her in watching the women's spring and summer 2020 Paris Fashion Week runway show, which is set to be livestreamed on the Balmain website at 2:30 a.m.
As part of the collaboration, she had been tapped to serve as the show's artistic director for makeup.
According to published reports, the 22-year-old Jenner was also scheduled to celebrate the collaboration with an event at the label's Rue Saint-Honoré boutique.
Jenner also was scheduled to be a presenter with Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner at Sunday's 71st Primetime Emmy Awards.
However, she was a no-show.
Several news outlets have reported that Jenner's illness was severe enough for her to be hospitalized.
However, The Times has not been able to independently corroborate this information.
An email to Jenner's management team inquiring about the extent and source of the young star's illness went unanswered Thursday.
The Kylie X Balmain cosmetics collaboration, which will be officially unveiled at the show, includes eyeshadow, lip liner and lip gloss and is set to go on sale at 8 a.m. Friday on Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics website.
Kamala Harris Calls For Probe Into State Dept. Officials Working With Giuliani
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Thursday asked the inspector general of the State Department to investigate whether its officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, worked with Rudy Giuliani on any "partisan political activities."
Harris' written request to Inspector General Steve Linick comes as President Donald Trump is under intense legal scrutiny for pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival he may face in the 2020 presidential election.
Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, was part of the effort to influence Ukrainian officials, according to a summary of a conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president, and a related whistleblower complaint.
"To help ensure that the foreign relations of the United States are carried out in good faith, I request that you investigate these and other circumstances described in the complaint and preserve all relevant records," Harris, another 2020 presidential contender, wrote.
"I am particularly concerned that Department officials might have been aware of or aided Mr. Giuliani in violation of law or regulations against engaging in partisan political activities," she continued, urging Linick to determine whether Pompeo or any officials under him enabled Giuliani to advance Trump's political agenda.
Her concerns are rooted in details from the whistleblower's report, which states that multiple U.S. officials were aware of Trump's actions, including two ambassadors who spoke directly with Giuliani about the president's request.
Civility in Politics: New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber.
Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.
As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."
Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.
In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."
Mr Johnson, for his part, said he "deplores" threats made against MPs.
Jess Phillips 'frightened' after receiving 'be afraid' death threats
On Thursday, Labour MP Jess Phillips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to "kick the door" of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a "fascist."
And in a viral Twitter thread, Ellie Cooper, the daughter of senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Cox's murder .
Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump's formula, but it's unlikely he'll follow it
And Morrison does not have to say "fake news" to echo the President at times.
He complained about the media on Wednesday for running "completely false" and "completely misleading" accounts of his climate policies.
So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election, he will no doubt consider Trump's formula - and whether it works in November 2020.
But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific.
Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre.
Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle.
Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters, which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory.
Some of Morrison's critics on the left see a world they fear, or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want, when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump.
Imagine Morrison if that were so.
He would not only skip the United Nations climate summit.
He would ridicule it as a waste of time.
The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle who expect their political leaders to take it seriously.
And there is a gulf between the two leaders on the right of a superpower to dictate terms in the world.
"The future does not belong to globalists.
The future belongs to patriots," Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday.
The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle.
What that means may require long study, but it is an immediate contrast with the Australian support for negotiated settlements between countries rather than the will of one group of patriots imposed on others.
"We will be more secure and prosperous in a global order based on agreed rules, not one based on the exercise of power alone," Morrison told Asialink in Sydney in June.
Zimbabwe: Sanctions Slow Down Zim Progress
Zvamaida Murwira in NEW YORK, United States
Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development, President Mnangagwa has said.
He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens.
The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).
He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo.
While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, the President said, more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions.
These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions.
"Furthermore, sanctions are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable," he said.
The President said Zimbabwe was in a transition and was determined to overcome the reality that it had a collapsed economy and currency due to illegal sanctions.
Namibian President Hage Geingob weighed in, calling for the unequivocal lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that Harare could pursue its economic development agenda.
President Mnangagwa urged the United Nations (UN) to assert its authority and honour its principles by reining in countries that imposed the sanctions.
As the United Nations, let us boldly honour the principles of our Charter.
The wrongs of the world must be set right.
Unfair practices must be challenged; injustice, racism and all forms of oppression of man by man must be opposed and rejected.
"My country applauds the South African Development Community, the African Union and all those who stand with us in demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of these illegal sanctions," said President Mnangagwa.
Those that imposed these illegal sanctions must heed this call and lift them now.
Cooperation is a win-win game.
Sanctions are a lose-lose game.
Zimbabwe deserves a restart.
The West, specifically the US and the European Union (EU), imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium in protest over the irreversible land reform programme that sought to correct land ownership imbalances that had been inherited from the racist colonial regime.
Both the US and the EU claim to be champions of democracy and human rights, yet they are stifling economic growth in Zimbabwe through the maintenance of the racist sanctions.
Analysts have suggested that the West was using the sanctions as a ploy to effect regime change through making living standards difficult in Zimbabwe so that citizens turn against their Government.
The 39th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Tanzania noted the adverse impact on Zimbabwe's economy and the region at large, of the prolonged economic sanctions, and expressed solidarity.
SADC called for the immediate lifting of the sanctions to facilitate socio-economic recovery in the country, and declared October 25th as the date on which SADC member States can collectively voice their disapproval of the sanctions through various activities and platforms until the sanctions are lifted.
PM Narendra Modi At UN, Says "Have Anger, Commitment Against Terrorism"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the UN General Assembly today, stressed that the international community needs to unite against terror and work on consensus on fighting terrorism, which, he said, is among the biggest challenges not for any single country but for the entire world.
"For the sake of humanity, the world has to unite against terror," PM Modi said in his address.
Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi said there needed to be more anger globally about what terrorism was doing to humanity.
We belong to a country that has given the world Buddh (Buddha's message of peace), not 'Yuddh' (war).
When we raise our voice against terror, it is with seriousness and anger," said the Prime Minister in a 20-minute speech in Hindi, in which he also spoke about India's fight against global warming and its development initiatives.
This was his second address to the General Debate at the UN, five years after his maiden speech as Prime Minister in 2014.
"The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism dents those very principles that are the basis for the creation of the UN," PM Modi remarked.
Swami Vivekananada had given the message of harmony and peace to the Parliament of Religions, and not dissension.
The world's biggest democracy still has the same message for the world -- harmony and peace," he said.
During his week-long US visit, the Prime Minister has, without once making a direct reference to Pakistan, made it clear that the country is the epicenter of terror and needs to act against terrorists operating from its soil.
At the mega "Howdy, Modi!" event last Sunday, sharing a stage with US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister said: "They have made hatred towards India the centre of their agenda."
On Thursday, the US said any easing of tensions between India and Pakistan is contingent on Islamabad taking action against those who engaged in cross-border infiltration.
"I think what we would like to see are the conditions whereby India and Pakistan can have a constructive conversation that leads to an improvement of relations between the two nuclear powers," said Alice Wells, US Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.
And obviously, that is going to hinge off of counterterrorism, off of Pakistan's seriousness of effort in ensuring that groups don't take advantage and engage in cross-border infiltration, that there are serious steps to implement the Financial Action Task Force action plan that Pakistan has committed to, and which includes the prosecution of UN-designated terrorists.
"So whether it's Hafiz Saeed who currently is in custody and under prosecution, but also leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed, like Masood Azhar, who long have been able to exploit their presence on Pakistani soil," she said.
Japan sees North Korea missile, China space activity as threat
Japan has raised its caution level about North Korea's missile capability, saying in a defense report that the country resumed missile tests while taking no concrete denuclearization steps and had succeeded in making miniaturized warheads.
The annual defense paper, approved Friday by the Cabinet, underscores Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbor.
Its reaction to the North's recent tests contrasts to the low-key U.S. response.
Since the second U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed this year, North Korea has fired 10 short-range missiles and projectiles deemed new and upgraded.
The defense paper also highlights that China's threat is expanding into space from the regional seas.
Japan is also bolstering its defense role under its alliance with the U.S. and is launching a space unit and measures against cyber and electromagnetic attacks.
Brexit news: Britain on brink of 'watershed moment' as Remainers to accept 'they are wrong'
Caller Bob insisted MPs seeking to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise they are in the "wrong" position.
Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.
Phoning in Mike Graham's show on talkRADIO, Bob said: "I think it's a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours."
It's not that they want a deal for Brexit, they just don't want Brexit.
They're getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong.
Bob continued: "The reason for that, the fundamental reason for that, is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign."
It all goes back to one fundamental thing, this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution.
A lot of people say we don't have a Constitution, well, we do.
Boris Johnson on Thursday refused to apologise for describing attempts to block a no-deal break with the EU as the "surrender act."
But the Prime Minister acknowledged that he would have to be able to "reach out" to opposition MPs if he was to secure their support for any new deal he negotiated with the EU.
Speaking to BBC South, Mr Johnson said: "I need to reach out across the House of Commons."
Mr Barnier told reporters: "We are still ready to work on any new legal and operational proposal from the EU."
Following a fiery debate in the Commons, Speaker of the House John Bercow urged MPs to give up negative conduct.
Mr Bercow said: "I think there's a widespread sense across the House and beyond that yesterday the House did itself no credit."
There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House.
On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered, the culture was toxic.
6 Self-Help Books That -- Really! -- Help
"Mom & Me & Mom" By Maya Angelou
The memoir can teach anybody to forgive, let go of a tough past and get along with a hell-on-wheels parent (and we mean anybody.)
Maya Angelou's moving, honest portrait of her up and down relationship with Vivian Baxter -- the bold, smart, hard-drinking, pistol-toting woman who left Angelou with her grandmother for most of her childhood but reunited with her during her daughter's adolescence -- is full of wisdom, laughs and blockbuster sentences like, "there are times when no one is right and sometimes among family and children, no one can admit that there is no right, and that maybe at the same time there is no wrong," and, "She liberated me from a society that would have had me think of myself as the lower of the low.
She liberated me to life." -- Leigh Newman
GM Reverses Course On Decision To Cut Off Health Care For Striking Workers
General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage.
The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was "very concerned about the significant confusion" surrounding employee health insurance and that it had "chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place" for workers on strike.
The company assured there would be "no disruption" to medical, dental and prescription drug coverage.
The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM, which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended.
That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage.
Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike.
The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday.
The union's lead negotiator on the GM contract, Vice President Terry Dittes, sent a letter to the company accusing it of "toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families."
"There is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act!"
The company declined to say how long it intended to fund the health care benefits if the strike continues for weeks.
The stoppage had entered its 11th day on Thursday, with no clear end in sight.
It is possible if the strike persists the company could decide again to force the union to pay for benefits out of its strike fund.
Dittes said Wednesday that the UAW was waiting on a response from GM on the union's latest proposals and that "the back and forth will continue" until everything is resolved.
The union and the company had been far apart on key issues, including the wage scale for newer hires, the company's use of temporary workers, and the share of health care costs borne by employees.
The strike involves nearly 50,000 workers at more than 50 GM facilities around the country.
The UAW is also negotiating new contracts this year with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, the other members of the Big Three.
The union chose to bargain first with GM, extending its previous contracts with the other two automakers.
UAW leadership called for a strike at GM starting Sept. 16 after workers" contract there expired.
As HuffPost reported in July, the negotiations for a new four-year contract were expected to be the most difficult in more than a decade.
Workers are expecting to make significant gains after sacrificing to prop up the company around the time of the financial crisis.
GM, meanwhile, wants to keep labor costs down as auto sales slow.
As one GM worker previously told HuffPost, "It's time for them to give back."

Saudi FM: Financial pressure is best way to control Iran
Saudi Arabia called on the world to apply "utmost pressure with every tool available" to end Iran's aggressive conduct, saying Thursday that the most effective way to control Tehran is to cut off its financial resources.
Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf again blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities, which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6% of daily global crude production.
"We know very well who stood behind this aggression," Al-Assaf told the U.N. General Assembly.
He called the strikes a flagrant violation of international laws and a threat to international peace and security.
We have known that regime for 40 years.
It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions, destruction and assassinations, not only in our region but also throughout the world," Al-Assaf said.
Utmost pressure with every tool available should be applied to end the terrorist and aggressive conduct of the Iranian regime.
Saudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched.
The United States, France, Britain and Germany also blame Iran, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018.
Iran has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement, and its president, Hassan Rouhani, says the Tehran government will not talk until the sanctions are lifted.
"Cease this policy of maximum pressure and pursue a policy of dialogue and logic and reason," he stressed at a news conference on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has deferred, at least for now, any immediate military strike on Iran.
But he approved a broader effort to beef up security in Saudi Arabia and the region.
He told reporters that showing restraint "shows far more strength" than launching retaliatory strikes now.
The U.S. said Thursday it was sending one Patriot missile battery and four ground-based radar systems to Saudi Arabia, in what officials describe as the first steps to help the kingdom protect itself against Iranian attacks.
Two more Patriot batteries and a THAAD missile defense system will be prepared to go later if needed, and the deployment will involve about 200 troops.
Said al-Assaf: "It is necessary for the international community to realize that cutting off sources of finance is the best way to compel the regime to renounce its militias, prevent it from developing ballistic missiles and put an end to its destabilizing activities in the region and the world."
He added: "We are dealing with a rogue and terrorist system that continues to threaten international peace and security.
It also jeopardizes energy supplies and the world economy; hence, the recent attacks are a real test of the international community's will.
Tensions between Iran and the West have risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with several world powers, saying the agreement was woefully inadequate.
The U.S. went on to impose heavy sanctions on Iran, even as other nations that signed the nuclear accord argued for trying to salvage it.
After continuing to comply with the agreement for a year, Iran has returned to expanding its nuclear enrichment program.
Trump Attacks Whistleblower Sources, Suggests Complaint Is Treason: Reports
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as "almost a spy" and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were "treason," reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
The whistleblower, an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer, alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump's reelection in 2020.
The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange, according to the complaint.
The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump's spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.
"Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they're almost a spy," Trump said.
"Who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information?
Because that's close to a spy," the president continued.
You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?
We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.
No one in the U.S. has been convicted of treason ― a crime punishable by death ― in the last 70 years, according to NBC News.
The House Intelligence Committee released the declassified complaint Thursday ahead of Maguire's hearing.
The complainant alleges Trump's call with Zelensky amounted to an "abuse of his office for personal gain" and that White House officials were directed by White House lawyers to store a transcript of the call in an electronic system used to handle classified information.
Maguire, whom Trump appointed to head the U.S. intelligence community last month, testified Thursday that he believed the whistleblower had "acted in good faith" when filing the complaint.
"I have every reason to believe they have done everything by the book and followed the law," he told the committee.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) condemned Trump's attacks on the whistleblower and his or her sources.
"The President's suggestion that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with as "we used to do" for "spies and treason" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation," Schiff tweeted.
All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation.
Fife Flyers expect toughest test yet in Belfast Giants double-header
Fife Flyers will face their toughest test of the season to date when they take on Belfast Giants in a Challenge Cup double-header this weekend.
That's according to head coach Todd Dutiaume who wants his team to rise to the challenge against last season's Elite League champions, with a ferry trip to the Northern Irish capital on Saturday followed by the return match at Fife Ice Arena on Sunday.
"From what we've seen on tape, Belfast are an incredibly deep, well-rounded, physical and hard-working side," Dutes said.
I imagine that will be our toughest challenge to date as a group, and we want to respond well to it.
With a win and a defeat each, Flyers and Belfast both have two points after two games in Challenge Cup Group B.
The weekend results could go a long way towards claiming a top three finish, and a quarter-final place.
The Kirkcaldy side will need to find a way past former netminder Shane Owen, who moved to Belfast in the summer after an impressive season between the pipes in Fife.
"We have a tremendous amount of respect not only for Shane but all our former players," Dutiaume said.
He was recruited by an opposition team for a reason, and he seems to have settled in well there.
I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to shake hands with him after the game, but up until that point it has to be business as usual.
Instead of focusing on who we know or don't know, we have to be prepared to go into battle with these guys and grind out two crucial wins in the Challenge Cup.
While the cup takes focus this weekend, Flyers have enjoyed a positive start to their league campaign, sitting top of the standings despite a 4-2 defeat in Guildford on Sunday that saw the team endure a 24-hour round bus trip.
Depsite their early success, Dutiaume believes there is still room for improvement.
"We've had a great start to the season, but we'd still like to be better at retrieving the puck, defensively, in all three areas of the ice," he explained.
That's a work in progress.
For instance, in the Nottingham game, all six players played a significant part in not only retaining possession but also getting it back when there was a turnover.
It's a commitment to stick with the plan, and work hard in all aspects of the game.
If the puck goes in people are fast to blame the goaltender or defencemen, but these are the last lines of defence.
You need all guys on the ice, at all times, buying into playing on both sides of the puck and this is going to be key to our success.
Sitting top of the standings is a good place to be, but if as a group we rest on that then we're all not doing our jobs.
We have to fight for the right to stay up around top of the table, and it takes a commitment every night.
Dutiaume also stressed the importance of keeping five men on the ice after taking nine minor penalties in Guildford on Sunday.
"We ran into early penalty trouble and that's a big momentum swinger," he said.
We need to stay out of the box consistently because when you're on the back foot killing for big portions at the start of a hockey game, regardless if it's evened up later, you can lose that momentum quickly and it's hard to gain it back.
All teams will talk about having a great start and making sure they take early steps to get a psychological and physical advantage.
Dutiaume is also hoping his team can become more potent on the powerplay, adding: "Our powerplay is successful when we stick with it and stay patient, rather than trying to force passes because a team is killing great against us, and we end up getting ourselves isolated.
We have an incredibly offensive bunch so the powerplay is not concerning, we just have to get comfortable with the system and make sure we're not standing around."
Nancy Pelosi is subject of book by daughter Christine Pelosi
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes from someone who knows her well, daughter Christine Pelosi.
"The Nancy Pelosi Way" will be released Nov. 26, Skyhorse Publishing announced Thursday.
Christine Pelosi's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration.
According to Skyhorse, Christine Pelosi will weave together "the professional and personal experiences" of her mother.
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic Party strategist and author of "Campaign Boot Camp" and "Campaign Boot Camp 2.0."
Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Taoiseach opens new Irish Consulate in LA
The Taoiseach has opened a new Consulate General of Ireland in Los Angeles.
Leo Varadkar was accompanied by the Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti at the ceremony.
It is the latest in a series of new foreign diplomatic missions that have been opened as part of "Global Ireland," a government initiative that aims to double Ireland's international presence by 2025.
The Taoiseach is in Los Angeles for a two-day trade mission focused on Ireland's growing television and film industries.
He will meet with senior executives from some of the world's leading streaming companies, studios and networks, including Netflix, Hulu, Skydance and Fox Searchlight.
The Government plans to double the size of the audio-visual sector over the next five years by increasing production activity and doubling the numbers of people employed in the sector to 24,000.
Tucker Carlson Calls Adam Schiff 'Demonstrably Mentally Ill'
Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Thursday called House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff "demonstrably mentally ill" in a rant about those who say "extreme and mindless things" to get on television.
"The prime example is Adam Schiff," the host said on "Tucker Carlson Tonight."
This coming from a guy who called white supremacy a hoax.
Carlson was leading into Schiff's improvised version of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as U.S. military aid was temporarily blocked.
Then Carlson, who declared that it's "hard to believe" that Trump's actions are an impeachable offense, ratcheted up his takedown of the California lawmaker.
"He recently went into a kind of trance and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine," said Carlson, who showed a clip of Thursday's congressional hearing chaired by Schiff.
Keep in mind, that isn't some guy babbling in the men's room at Starbucks.
That is the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee.
We trust him with the most sensitive information, and yet he is clearly, demonstrably mentally ill.
Barrhead Travel opens up 100 jobs for former Thomas Cook staff
Scots holiday firm Barrhead Travel has thrown a lifeline to scores of Thomas Cook staff who lost their jobs with its recent collapse, by opening up 100 positions across its 34 branded stores.
Thomas Cook - the world's oldest travel firm - folded at the start of this week, prompting the loss of 21,000 jobs worldwide, about 9,000 of them in the UK.
It had more than 600 branches, including about 30 in Scotland.
Barrhead has created positions throughout its UK store network, with new jobs across Scottish cities and towns including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.
It plans on using a team to travel to meet potential candidates over the coming weeks.
Barrhead said former Thomas Cook employees "will bring a wealth of experience to the Barrhead Travel family and are being actively encouraged to contact the Barrhead Travel recruitment line."
Its "Brilliant Travel" division is also fast-tracking applications for up to 100 additional homeworkers or those looking to start their own independent agency.
Renfrewshire-based Barrhead added that there continues to be growing customer demand for specialist holidays such as adventure travel, weddings and honeymoons, river cruise and luxury.
The majority of positions available are customer-focused in their branches or specialist call centres, but there are vacancies also available in marketing, IT and business development.
Barrhead Travel president Jacqueline Dobson said: "We are very proud of our family ethos at Barrhead Travel and are keen to save jobs where we can and support industry colleagues from Thomas Cook.
Many of us have very fond memories of Thomas Cook - both professionally and personally.
We put a lot of support into developing our people and we believe we offer some of the best staff benefits in the industry."
It's clear that the teams from Thomas Cook are truly passionate about finding their clients" dream holiday and we want to help them get back to doing what they do best as soon as possible."
Thomas Cook ceased trading after failing to secure the extra £200 million needed to keep the business afloat.
Gatwick airport drone shutdown could have been an inside job, police say
Whoever flew the drones that closed Gatwick during the busiest week of the winter "had detailed knowledge of the airport," according to Sussex Police.
But after nine months of investigation, police responsible for the airport say they may never find the culprit.
Between 18 and 20 December, two "unmanned aerial vehicles" closed the world's busiest runway for 33 hours - cancelling 1,000 flights and disrupting the travel plans of 150,000 travellers.
The closure of Gatwick airport cost airlines around £50m in lost revenue and passenger care costs.
The policing operation and subsequent investigation have cost £800,000.
Assistant chief constable Dave Miller, head of operations command, said: "This was a serious and deliberate criminal act designed to endanger airport operations and the safety of the travelling public."
More than 100 "credible witnesses" were interviewed, who were "used to working in a complex airport environment."
They included a pilot, airport workers and airport police.
Their statements indicate the drones were flown in 12 separate bursts across the three days.
The activity ranged from seven to 45 minutes.
"On six of these occasions, witnesses clearly saw two drones operating simultaneously," said Sussex Police.
The report says there was no evidence to indicate the activity was related to terrorism, nor was it state-sponsored.
Earlier this month, a climate-change group called Heathrow Pause attempted to shut down Heathrow airport by flying drones, but in the Gatwick incident, no campaigning group is thought to be responsible.
In April, Chris Woodroofe, chief operating officer at Gatwick, told BBC's Panorama: "It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport."
Sussex Police say they have identified, researched and ruled out 96 "people of interest."
A couple from Crawley were wrongly arrested in December for the drone attack.
Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk were released without charge.
Mr Miller said: "With support from national experts, we have carried out an exhaustive criminal investigation but, without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of enquiry at this time.
Measures now available have strengthened our capability to respond to and investigate a similar incident in the future."
Biffa fined for trying to ship household waste to China
The waste management firm Biffa has been fined £350,000 for trying to ship household rubbish to China labelled as wastepaper fit for recycling.
Items found in the bales included sanitary towels, nappies, wet wipes and condoms - with the shipping containers reeking of vomit.
A search of seven 25-tonne shipping containers bound for China at Felixstowe port in Suffolk found waste items including plastic containers, plastic bags, scrap metal and electrical debris.
Other items found during the search included laminate flooring, coat hangers, pet food containers, latex gloves and pieces of china.
Environment Agency inspectors also found women's underwear, bags of dog excrement and a 12-inch record by the 90s band Deee-Lite.
Biffa Waste Services, the second largest recycling company in the UK, claimed the bales contained 98.5% waste paper, which can be legally transported to China.
Shipping heavily contaminated waste to the country has been illegal since 2006 because it is not part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Biffa was convicted of two counts of breaching waste transportation laws between May and June 2015 after a three-week trial at Wood Green crown court in north London in June.
Jurors heard Biffa, which reported revenues of £683.6m last year, used two brokers to manage the deal to send the waste to sites in Shenzhen and Guangdong on the South China Sea coast.
One of the brokers arranged a shipment of 5,863 tonnes of wastepaper between Biffa worth £350,000, while the second arranged the sale of 4,992 tonnes of wastepaper worth £290,000.
However, the Environment Agency prevented any of the seven containers from leaving Felixstowe.
The company claimed its exports were regularly inspected by the Chinese authorities who had never made complaints, and that its clients were capable of generating significant quantities of paper from the bales it supplied.
Handing Biffa a £350,000 fine on Friday, the judge, Simon Auerbach, said: "The principle of this environmental regulation is to the prevent export of our waste processing and disposing of the problem to other parts of the world.
Exporting to non-OECD countries is the very essence of the offence and the willingness of the Chinese authorities to accept it and their ability to process it are not, in my judgment, the point.
Biffa was also ordered to pay £240,000 costs to the Environment Agency and a confiscation order of £9,912, which was the total amount it received for the blocked shipment of waste.
Richard Branwell, defending Biffa, highlighted the shortcomings of the UK's waste management system as a whole, pointing out that of all the 8m tonnes of fibre recovered each year, just 3.3m tonnes can be recycled domestically.
He said Biffa's business model of exporting waste was vital to helping the government meet its recovery and recycling targets.
Sailesh Mehta, prosecuting, said contaminants could be seen poking out of bales that were not broken open by inspectors.
Mehta said Biffa had dismissed suggestions that its waste sorting process could be improved to prevent contaminants ending up in bales of waste paper.
The company had claimed its processes were already "as good as it gets" when ideas such as employing more pickers or slowing conveyor belts were floated.
"If all [these ideas] are impossible, we suggest it is incumbent on the defendant charged with this important duty to start the whole system afresh," he said.
French chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
PARIS (AP) - French authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.
No one was injured in Thursday's fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours.
Firefighters are still on the scene.
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night.
The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
New units to cater for disabled residents
Ten new apartments will be designed and built for young people with disabilities in Fraser Property Australia's western Sydney development Ed. Square, with one more apartment set aside for an on-site support worker.
The development, located at Edmondson Park near Liverpool, will feature more than 992 apartments and 892 terraces and townhomes with a range of styles and floorplans across six hectares of open land.
The development is to include a 19-storey residential tower and will be completed in the second half of 2020.
Prior to moving in, the apartments will be kitted out with everything disabled people need to meet High Physical Support benchmarks for residential disability housing under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
The deal, struck between Fraser Property Australia and disability housing provider Summer Housing, increases the range and scale of housing options available for those with disabilities, according to Summer Housing Australia chief executive officer Dan McLennan.
Mr McLennan said the right housing and support in the right location can increase a person's quality of life and independence, while reducing lifetime care costs.
"Summer Housing's delivery model is a contemporary one that brings accessible and affordable housing and support together with smart home technology to give individuals greater choice and control over how they live," he said.
Frasers Property Australia's development director Warwick Dowler said connectivity is an important part of the criteria for housing people with a disability.
You don't have to have a car at Ed. Square as you are already connected to a thriving community and the Edmondson Park train station is on your doorstep," he said.
Everything at Ed. Square will be within minutes.
The town centre will provide a shopping, dining and entertainment precinct incorporating an Eat Street, fresh food marketplace and Coles supermarket, state-of-the-art Event Cinema, childcare centre, water play area, tavern and healthcare facilities.
Pictured: Schoolgirl, 10, who died after a suspected hit-and-run in Newcastle
The schoolgirl was hit by a car in Newcastle at around 6.40pm Wednesday night
Melissa Tate, 10, who was rushed to a local hospital, died of catastrophic injuries
The schoolgirl who died from catastrophic injuries following a suspected hit-and-run in Newcastle has been pictured for the first time.
Melissa Tate, 10, was hit by the car in the Kenton area of the city at about 6.40pm on Wednesday.
Police announced on Thursday that, after being rushed to hospital with devastating injuries, the little girl sadly died.
Two 23-year-old men were arrested, as well as two women in the wake of the smash.
Northumbria Police Chief Inspector Chris Grice said: 'This is understandably a difficult time for the family and it is something that nobody should have to go through.'
Specialist officers have been supporting them since Melissa was involved in the collision on Wednesday night and they continue to do so.
A group leaves flowers at the scene where a girl was hit by a car and later died of her injuries
We will remain with them over the coming days and weeks, and will be on hand to help them in any way we can.
'This incident has had a big impact on the community in Kenton and I know that residents will come together to support Melissa's family.
However, I would ask that people respect their privacy at this time and allow them to grieve as a family.'
Arsenal fans in meltdown over Xhaka becoming captain... but rival supporters think it's hilarious - The Sun
THE NEWS that Granit Xhaka is set to be announced as Arsenal's club captain has been met with agony by many Gooners.
Reports indicate that Unai Emery entrusted the decision to his squad, having originally picked a five-strong group of leaders to rotate the armband.
Xhaka's appointment has divided supporters
And on Friday news broke that Xhaka was to be named the official replacement of Laurent Koscielny, who controversially left Arsenal in the summer.
Many Gunners fans are ready to get behind the Swiss midfielder but others see him as a liability.
The reports happened to pop up on Xhaka's 27th birthday and critics used a club well-wishing post to vent their frustration.
Gooner Zaki wrote: "Announce six month holiday as birthday present."
Another, Yash, added: "Sell him as a gift."
While Ariss remarked: "Xhaka boom Xhaka out of my club."
And Aliwa lamented: "Doesn't deserve to wear the armband, he's a total banter in our team."
One fan accounted however, rebuffed: "These so called Arsenal fans are the worst.
Highly aggressive children who never achieved anything in their life.
Fans of rival teams took aim at Arsenal as well, claiming it was further evidence the North London side had lost their way.
One Spurs fan commented a mock-up of the Jose Mourinho meme reading: "I prefer not to laugh, if I laugh I am in big trouble."
An Everton fan joked: "Just realised I can't laugh at Arsenal for making Xhaka their captain because ours runs off the pitch three times a week and hasn't picked his head up for a cross since 2014."
A Chelsea fan added: "We also don't have a captain at Chelsea, but Xhaka at Arsenal!?"
Toyota said to be increasing stake in Subaru to more than 20%
Toyota Motor plans to raise its stake in Subaru to more than 20% from around 17% now, a deal that would also see the smaller firm invest in Japan's top automaker, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The deal is due to be approved at a Toyota board meeting on Friday, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
The investment would come a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor, said they would take small equity stakes in each other.
Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development.
Traditional carmakers, especially smaller ones like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry being transformed by the rise of electric vehicles, ride-hailing and autonomous driving.
Toyota's investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru's stock market value, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported the news.
Subaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota's additional investment, one of the people told Reuters.
Representatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies.
Subaru is particularly strong in sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and all-wheel-drive technology.
The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to split costs.
Carmakers around the world have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology.
Ford Motor and Volkswagen have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.
Toyota seems to be particularly keen to build scale now by investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.
It has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units.
Shares of Toyota were down 0.9% while shares of Subaru fell 1.5% on Friday morning.
Jurgen Klopp provides update on Sadio Mane injury ahead of Liverpool's trip to Sheffield United
Sadio Mane is available for Liverpool's clash with Sheffield United on Saturday.
The Senegal international suffered a knock and a dead leg in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Chelsea last Sunday and missed the 2-0 victory over MK Dons in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening.
But Mane trained with his Liverpool teammates on Thursday and Klopp has no concerns over the forward ahead of his side's trip to Bramall Lane in Saturday's early kick-off.
"Both trained yesterday, Sadio and Div [Divock Origi], completely normal, no issues," said the Liverpool manager.
Klopp also confirmed that Xherdan Shaqiri remains sidelined while James Milner is expected to overcome a back injury he suffered in the win over MK Dons.
"Shaq is not ready yet, he's doing rehab stuff," said Klopp.
Milli got a knock in his back against MK Dons early in the game, he looked a bit awkward after the game but he should be good.
Ballie Ballerson Soho: Exclusive first look at the new ball pit cocktail bar
Ballie Ballerson is opening a second site in Soho this evening, and the Standard has an exclusive first look.
The ball pool cocktail bar is opening a new venue on Berwick Street, with 6,000 square feet of ball pits.
Ballie Ballerson's original Shoreditch site quickly became a favourite with Londoners after opening in 2016, boasting the world's largest permanent ball pit.
Guests at Berwick Street can expect a colourful, neon-lit setting, and a cocktail list featuring the likes of the Soho Sundown - mixed up out of rhubarb gin, lemon juice, syrup and meringue.
Founder Wenny Armstrong told the Standard: "We have introduced touches, such as our Soho Sundown ball pit, to create a part of the experience that gently reflects the history of the area, as well as an exclusive Soho inspired cocktail and pizza.
Having a ball: The original site quickly became a favourite after opening in 2016
Our whole aesthetic has really taken a step up from our pop-up origins to meet the expectations that come with being in such a competitive location.
It could be the first of a number of new Ballie Ballerson venues too, with Armstrong also revealing that they're currently "seeking additional locations," which may expand into other parts of the country.
The original site closes for a refurbishment this month, and will reopen in early November.
Liverpool's Allison set to resume first-team training
Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker is expected to make his long-awaited return to first-team training this weekend.
The Brazil international has been sidelined with a calf injury since the opening match of the season on 9 August.
It will come too late for him to be considered for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off at Sheffield United but he is set to rejoin the group 24 hours later as preparations start for the Champions League tie at home to Red Bull Salzburg.
"Alisson looks like he is close, but the final word is with the medical department," said manager Jurgen Klopp.
He's not in contention for tomorrow.
Maybe he can train with the team from Sunday on.
I'm not a doctor, I take their information.
Alisson's injury was serious but in the last two weeks he progressed really, really well.
Credit to the medical department.
They have waited long enough to start him training.
There was more good news on the injury front, with Sadio Mane fully recovered from a dead leg sustained in last weekend's win at Chelsea and fellow forward Divock Origi back after missing three matches with an ankle problem.
"Sadio Mane and Divock Origi both trained yesterday and have no issues," added Klopp.
However, Xherdan Shaqiri, who injured a calf in training on Monday, is not ready to return.
How dare you?
Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.
A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019.
Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000.
Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.
Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.
"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.
Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."
"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests.
We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems.
But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs.
Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.
How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.
The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.
The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.
North Korea slams US "inaction" on lifting sanctions after nuclear talks
North Korea accused the United States of doing nothing to implement issues agreed on at summits between US President Donald Trump and the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, but said it is placing hope in the US president's "wise option and bold decision."
A statement from Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan circulated by North Korea's UN mission came days after Mr Trump said, without elaborating, that another summit meeting with Kim "could happen soon."
"It draws my keen interest that it is highly topical these days in the US to hold another DPRK-US summit," the adviser said, using the initials of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
But he was critical of US inaction since the summits.
While past summits were "historic occasions" for the two leaders "to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula," Kim Kye Gwan said "no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks."
The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea "has made sincere efforts to build trust" and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year.
He pointed to North Korea's repatriation of American detainees "who committed hostile acts" against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.
"However, the US has done nothing for implementing the joint statement," the North Korean official said.
On the contrary, he cited the resumption of US-South Korean military drills "which the US president personally pledged to suspend," and the ratcheting up of US sanctions against the North.
Kim Kye Gwan said it is "hard reality" that politicians in Washington are obsessed with "nuclear disarmament first" by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted and the country "can get access to a bright future."
The adviser said this makes him doubt whether "a new breakthrough" could take place in US-North Korean relations through another summit.
But he left a door open.
"I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on president Trump's wise option and bold decision," he said.
In his mid-70s, Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.
In his speech to the global gathering on Tuesday, Mr Trump briefly mentioned North Korea, saying the United States has pursued "bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula."
"I have told Kim Jong-un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realise that promise, North Korea must denuclearise," the US president said.
North Korea entered talks with the United States last year, saying it was willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief.
The North wants a step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearisation step is matched by a corresponding US reward.
The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearisation.
During the Singapore summit, Kim Jong-un promised to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or road map for disarmament steps.
In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
They met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit.
But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Mr Trump rejected Kim's request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step.
The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.
Indian Military Training Team Chopper Crashes In Bhutan, 2 Dead
An Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) helicopter crashed in eastern Bhutan on Friday, killing two people, including a Bhutanese pilot.
The chopper that took off from Khirmu in Arunachal Pradesh lost contact near Yonphula, the Army said, adding that the wreckage has been located.
In an unfortunate incident, an Indian Army helicopter has crashed at 1 pm near Yonphula in Bhutan.
The helicopter went out of radio and visual contact soon after 1 pm.
"The helicopter was on way from Khirmu (Arunanchal) to Yonphula on duty," the Army said in a statement.
Ground search and rescue was launched immediately from Yonphula.
The wreckage has been located.
"IAF and Army helicopters were also launched from Misamari, Guwahati and Hashimara," it added.
The single engine Cheetah helicopter was piloted by an Indian and a Bhutanese Army pilots, the army said, adding there were no survivors.
Boris Johnson attacks Scottish government for 'grave inadequacies'
The Prime Minister has attacked the SNP, saying he plans to introduce measures to "compensate for the grave inadequacies" of the Scottish government.
Speaking ahead of the Conservative party conference, Boris Johnson said he would accelerate measures to create "a much stronger Scottish economy" whether there is a deal or no-deal Brexit.
He also reiterated his strong opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum.
In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Johnson said: "They have the highest taxes anywhere in the UK.
They are not doing a good job on health, they are not doing a good job on education."
First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon has supported the possibility of a second independence referendum.
'I hope the money that we are now investing is properly spent on those services.
And I hope that Scottish Conservatives get the credit they deserve for the hundreds of millions of extra funding that we're putting into Scottish agriculture which was secured, not by Nicola Sturgeon, but by Scottish Conservatives.'
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said she wants to have another referendum on leaving the UK in the second half of 2020, but Mr Johnson has previously stated his opposition to a second vote on the issue.
He told BBC Scotland on Thursday: "We had an independence referendum in 2014 and we made an explicit promise to the people of Scotland that this was going to be a once-in-a-generation event.
The people of Scotland voted very, very substantially to stay part of the UK, which was the right decision as this is the most successful union anywhere in the world.
They were promised this was a once-in-a-generation thing and I think we should stick with that."
Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as "untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions."
She tweeted: "The Westminster opposition should unite around a plan to trigger the no confidence process to bring Johnson's government down, ensure the Benn Act is honoured and enable a General Election as quickly as possible.
Doing nothing should not be an option."
The Scottish Government has been asked for comment on the interview with Mr Johnson.
Jess Phillips says she got email threatening "you and your Remain friends"
Jess Phillips has said she feels "jumpy and worried" after a man was arrested outside the Labour MP's office and she received threats aimed at "you and your Remain friends."
The Birmingham Yardley MP said her staff had to be confined to her constituency office as a man allegedly kicked the door, tried to smash windows and yelled she was a "fascist."
She told Sky News she has received death threats overnight and has been left feeling "jumpy and worried and frightened," as she revealed the contents of an email she has shared with police.
"Unless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid... wherever you are, keep looking over your shoulder," it read.
The person standing behind you may not be friendly.
You and your Remain friends have been warned.
The alleged attack on her office came as Boris Johnson came under scrutiny for his use of "inflammatory" language, with Jeremy Corbyn saying the Tory was encouraging people to act in "disgraceful and abusive" ways.
Ms Phillips said the Prime Minister "isn't helping" though she does not blame him, but added: "If he doesn't change his strategy, I absolutely will."
West Midlands Police said on Friday that a 36-year-old man remained in custody on suspicion of a public order offence and possession of cannabis.
Officers were called to the Yardley Road premises shortly before 2.25pm on Thursday.
It was closed to her constituency on Friday.
Ms Phillips was among the MPs to tell Mr Johnson to apologise for his language in the Commons, saying his choice of words had been designed to "inflame hatred and division."
She tweeted on Wednesday that she had received an "anonymous letter" to her constituency office.
"It was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: "I would rather be found dead in a ditch,"" it read.
Mr Johnson on Friday doubled down on his use of language, refusing to stop calling a law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit the "surrender act."
How to navigate the Sydney market this spring
House hunters need to have a game plan that they are prepared to obey to combat a turbulent Sydney market that is throwing up plenty of conflicting results.
Experts say that in a market that is seeing the Sydney clearance rate hover around 80 per cent and a lack of stock, buyers need to be patient to avoid having FOMO, the fear-of-missing-out.
Since the federal election, record low interest rates and the loosening of lending requirements, the Sydney market has seen plenty of mixed results, with many houses selling for hundred thousands of dollars above the reserve, while others are only just selling.
The mixed market has seen a small but stable growth in price, with CoreLogic August monthly home value index showing a 1.6 per cent increase in house prices.
REA chief economist Nerida Conisbee said Sydney is a tale of two cities at the moment and it is causing volatile results.
"The inner city and eastern suburbs are seeing the best conditions, with strong search activity that is now flowing through to pricing, while other parts of Sydney remain stable," she said.
Ms Conisbee said the price guides and reserves that have been broken by so much is from a combination of factors including limited stock, buyer confidence and real estate agents remaining cautious.
"It is taking a while for agents to get up to speed with pricing and the valuation may not be as reflective as the mood on the ground," she said.
However, while we are seeing many huge results, the data is still yet to reflect this at the moment, which may be playing a role.
Buyer's agent and CEO of Propertybuyer.com.au Rich Harvey agreed that there were pockets of the market that were not being priced to reflect current market conditions.
"It is creating false hope for many buyers who think they can have a chance for a property with a $1.3 million guide, when it will really sell for $1.5 million," he said.
To have success this spring, buyers need to be resilient and do their homework, Mr Harvey said.
"Never go to an auction without knowing how much you can spend, as I've seen many panicked buyers who go unprepared and spend more than what they should," he said.
If an auction goes above your budget and you miss out, don't worry as there will be another home out there.
Mr Harvey said buyers should also research recent comparable sales and know how the area is performing to avoid overpaying for a property.
Independent auctioneer and Sky News commentator Tom Panos said house hunters should also tread carefully and not get carried away with a lack of stock available.
"With a decrease of new listings putting pressure on the market, buyers are getting more emotional and are paying $300,000-$400,000 above reserve as a result," he said.
This was the scene a fortnight ago in Strathfield, where a six-bedroom property sold for $900,000 above reserve after an emotional auction saw two registered bidders who both desperately wanted the home refuse to give up, even as it sailed past the reserve.
Mr Panos said buyers need to have a walkaway figure and come up with a plan B to avoid only looking and settling for one property.
"Having a plan B puts a buyer in the best position to avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket and making irrational decisions," he said.
If buyers find their budget isn't working for them after many auction defeats, Mr Panos said they should avoid lowering their expectations.
"Don't fall into a trap of going for a home you don't really want as changeover costs are high," he said.
Instead, look at neighbouring suburbs that offer the same amenities for a fraction of the price.
With the Sydney market facing a shortage of stock, Mr Panos said house hunters need to be patient.
"Buyers need to tread carefully as we are going to have a late spring this year and there will be auctions all the way up to Christmas," he said.
Once the school holidays are finished, Mr Panos said there will be a rush of new listings from sellers who are eager to take advantage of a strong market.
It will also mean buyers should have more properties to choose from than what there has been so far this spring.
It also means that window of opportunity vendors have had with strong auction results these last few months will soften as a result of an increase in stock levels.
Currently there are 400 fewer new listings on the market this year compared to the 1805 at the same time last year, according to CoreLogic.
Mugabe Burial Set for Zvimba As Govt Gives in to Family Demands
The Zimbabwean government has given the family of the late former president Robert Mugabe a go ahead to bury him in Zvimba communal lands, Mashonaland West, instead of a so-called mausoleum being constructed at the National Heroes Acre.
In an interview, Information Secretary, Nick Mangwana, said the family has a right to designate the burial place of the former Zimbabwean leader, who died of cancer on September 6th in Singapore.
The family of the later former President R. G. Mugabe has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba.
In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes, government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position.
Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family.
Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe's burial, Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa, told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president's burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders.
The Mugabe family had said they don't want anything to do with the heroes acre.
This is something they were saying from the day he was declared dead.
So, they just went ahead and did that thing.
So they flushed money down the drain ...
Our members of parliament are going to be demanding accountability.
We want to know how much money had gone into that project and how they are going to replace that money.
The late president will be laid to rest Saturday, according to family members.
Justice Department To Open Facebook Antitrust Investigation, Source Says
The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company.
Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
Large tech companies, including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence.
Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The company, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday.
Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.
The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms.
It did not specify which ones, but said it would consider concerns raised about "search, social media and some retail services online."
Neither agency has revealed the focus of investigations into Facebook, though the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FTC's probe is focused on the company's acquisitions.
The world's largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, showed data from S&P Global.
The Justice Department's antitrust chief likewise told a tech conference in August that the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of its broad review.
This led some industry observers to question whether the two federal investigations would overlap.
Lawmakers, in particular Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, criticized the appearance of an overlap in a hearing last week.
The agencies generally have a practice of meeting to decide who will investigate which matter but the FTC cannot probe certain areas, for example price-fixing.
The probe into Facebook by the state attorneys general, announced earlier this month, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said that investigation would look into whether Facebook's actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.
Antonio Caruso to fight Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta
Antonio Caruso can see a lot of resemblances between AFL and fighting one-on-one inside a cage.
On face value the sports are polar opposites, but the training and mental dedication needed to succeed run on tight parallel.
And a new life in Florida, sparring with the world's fighters in preparation for his ONE Championship MMA debut, has surprising throwbacks to his amateur football days at Salisbury West.
"Imagine you're playing in the AFL but you're training with an amateur club, then you go out on a Saturday and play with the AFL boys," he said.
Of course you can kick and catch the same, but the temper, the pace, it's not the same.
Some days I'll walk away, some rounds I've lost badly, but previous to that, back home, I was never getting challenged.
The reflection was born on the back of a hard training session run by former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at Hard Knocks MMA gym - Carusos's home away form home.
The undefeated 28-year-old said the grinding work has him primed to take out Mongolian Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta on October 25.
"You can be on the mat at any one time with three or four champions, mixing it up with them," he said.
That's the biggest change here, there's no easy rounds, there's no easy work.
I can't run before a sparring session and then go spar, these guys will run rings around me.
But I feed off of it.
Tsogookhuu (5W-1L) made his pro debut in 2016 and won the MGL-1 lightweight championship title in October, before making the move to Asia's biggest MMA promotion.
But under the guidance of head coach Henri Hooft, Caruso feels like a new man.
Henri's so advanced as a coach and he's seen it all, fighters from the best days to their worst days.
"You can't buy that type of experience," he said.
(Tsogookhuu) has grown up different to me, but it terms of skills and ability, he's tough and has what it takes, but it won't be enough.
He's going to be strong, but that doesn't hold you too long in this game.
In the card's main event, ONE welterweight champion Zebaztian Kadestam will defend his title against Kiamrian Abbasov.
Energy suppliers accused of 'greenwashing' tariffs to attract environmentally friendly customers
One supplier states "electricity supplied to your home is 100 per cent green," which Which? says is "impossible" to guarantee.
The consumer champion is calling on the government department Ofgem to offer greater clarity on how renewable energy is defined as the current system allows suppliers to rely exclusively on REGOs, "greenwash" their tariffs, and do "very little" to support new renewable electricity generation.
Editor-in-chief, said: 'As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it's concerning that some suppliers appear to be "greenwashing" their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.'
We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed.
People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.
For the investigation, Which? analysed 355 tariffs offering renewable electricity tariffs in June 2019 and found 20 suppliers selling 100 per cent renewable electricity tariffs without contracts to buy any renewable electricity.
World Athletics Championships: MP Jabir Qualifies For 400m Hurdle Semifinals, Long Jumper M Sreeshankar Disappoints
Long jumper M Sreeshankar failed to reach the final after a disappointing performance while 400m hurdler MP Jabir made it to the semifinals on the opening day of the World Athletics Championships in Doha on Friday.
Another 400m hurdler Dharun Ayyasamy, the national record holder, tumbled after the last hurdle in his heat to fail to qualify for the semifinals.
The 20-year-old Sreeshankar could only produce a best jump of 7.62m from his three attempts in the qualification B to finish 22nd overall.
His effort was well below his season's best of 8.00m, which he had produced only last month in Patiala.
Later in the day, Jabir finished third in the heat number one and 11th overall in men's 400m hurdle with a time of 49.62 seconds to qualify for the semifinals to be held on Saturday.
He has a season's and personal best of 49.13.
Ayyasamy could only clock 50.55 as he lost precious time after hitting the final hurdle.
He finished sixth in heat number five and 27th overall to miss out of the semifinals.
Ayyasamy, who had recovered from an injury recently, has a personal and season's best of 48.80.
The first four in each of the five heats and the next four fastest qualify for the 400m hurdles semifinals.
The first Indian to take the field on Friday was Sreeshankar, who has a personal best and national record of 8.20m.
He began with a 7.52m before clearing 7.62m.
He then fouled his third and final jump to end his campaign in disappointment.
The automatic mark for the finals was set at 8.15m but only one jumper could touch it.
The 11 other best performers went through to the finals with the least distance making the cut was 7.89m.
Sreeshankar's 7.62m effort here was his second worst this season.
He had 7.53m in the qualifying round of the National Inter-State Championships in Lucknow last month.
This season, he has been consistent around 7.80m with three jumps in the 7.90s, besides the 8.00m in Patiala on August 16.
Sreeshankar was, however, placed second last in terms of the season's best among the 27 jumpers who took part in the qualification round.
Karen Pence Was Reportedly 'Livid' With Trump's 'Access Hollywood' Tape
Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, was reportedly "livid" about that infamous "Access Hollywood" tape that surfaced a month before the 2016 presidential election.
Reporter Tom LoBianco, who covered Pence for The Associated Press and Indianapolis Star, reveals in his new book "Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House" that Karen Pence was very unhappy with the recording.
The notorious tape featured Donald Trump in 2005 bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" without their consent.
"Karen ... "was livid" at Trump's prurient comments in the "Access Hollywood" tape," The New York Times wrote in a Friday morning article covering LoBianco's book.
But her husband concluded it was too late to drop off the ticket.
On election night, LoBianco reports in his book, Karen Pence refused to kiss her husband.
"You got what you wanted, Mike," she told him.
"Leave me alone," The New York Times reported.
NYT correspondent Peter Baker muses that Karen Pence wields a lot of influence over her husband, who refuses to meet alone with women unless his wife is present.
Mike Pence, an Evangelical Christian, infamously said in 2002 that he "never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won't attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side."
Critics slammed Mike Pence for the comment when it resurfaced in 2017, saying it suggested he doesn't see women as professional equals and that women who work for him aren't given the same opportunities as men.
The man in the "white guy blinking" meme is now using his fame to raise money for a Multiple Sclerosis charity.
Drew Scanlon, 33, went viral when he became the face of the go-to GIF for users puzzled by some of the idiotic comments being spouted online.
Now he has cycled 120 miles from San Francisco to Wine Country for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society with a team of 10 bikers.
He also directed his large following towards his fundraising page to amass more than $37,000.
Mr Scanlon made use of his Twitter fame to raise money for the charity bike ride, saying: "Hi Internet!
If this GIF has ever brought you joy in the past, I humbly ask you to consider making a donation to the National MS Society.
It would mean a lot to me and to those I know affected by the disease!
Over on his fundraising page, he laid out the reasons for choosing to support the MS charity.
He said: "I'm not usually one to toot my own meme horn but in this case I'll make an exception.
You see, two close friends of mine and members of their families suffer from MS, a debilitating disease of the central nervous system that interrupts communication between the brain and the body.
Millions of people suffer from MS and there is no known cure.
This is where you come in."
Uganda: Impasse On Uganda's Oil Sector Short-Lived, Says Museveni
President Museveni has said he is in touch with the executives of oil companies and was expected to meet with them at the UN General Assembly to discuss the current impasse in the sector and chart a way forward.
Mr Museveni, who was speaking at the 5th oil and gas summit at Serena Hotel in Kampala on Wednesday evening, said he "expected to resolve their issues."
I was supposed to meet them in New York but I had more important issues to do here.
We shall resolve their issues," Mr Museveni told delegates, indicating he would be meeting them soon.
This is the first time Mr Museveni is publicly speaking about the companies since the collapse of the deal where Tullow Oil was expected to sell part of its interests in the Albertine Graben to Total E&P and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC).
The deal fell apart after the two-year grace period for negotiations expired.
The companies failed to agree with the government on tax and how much money must be counted as recoverable costs.
Tullow was expected to transfer 21 per cent of its 33.3 per cent in Kingfisher Blocks to Total and CNOOC.
Had the deal been completed, it was expected to pave way for the conclusion of the Final Investment Decision (FID).
This would mean that projects like the oil pipeline and the refinery would kick-off.
SNP considers installing Jeremy Corbyn as temporary prime minister
The SNP leadership is reportedly open to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn being installed as prime minister on a temporary basis in order to avoid a no deal Brexit.
The Nationalists are concerned there is little time left to agree a compromise candidate among opposition parties to replace Boris Johnson, if he were to be forced from office by a vote of no confidence.
A new PM could then approach Brussells to agree an extension to Article 50 before calling a general election.
"It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election," a source told ITV News.
The convention is absolutely clear that it is the leader of the opposition - in this case Jeremy Corbyn - who should become prime minister in those circumstances.
Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have.
Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.
The source added that the other opposition parties, and the 34 independent MPs, would have to come round to backing Corbyn, if they want to be certain of avoiding a no deal Brexit.
Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly said she would not support any deal that saw Mr Corbyn become PM.
Meghan to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and refuses let own needs 'fade away' amid her royal duties
Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.
Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.
During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.
Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.
We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.
She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.
Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.
'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.
That you have to be true to who you are.
She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.
'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.
'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.
A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.
She made it easy.
She is an easy-going royal.
Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.
Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now.
'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'
Angola: Minister Stresses Need to Revamp Iron Palace
Luanda - Angola's minister of Culture Maria da Piedade de Jesus has spoke of the need to boost and revive the Iron Palace in Luanda, turning the site into a Cultural Center.
This was during an audience granted to the French ambassador to Angola, Sylvain Itté, on Friday in Luanda aimed at strengthening cultural cooperation between the countries.
Maria de Jesus said that the objective is to make better use of infrastructure and making it available to the public.
The one floor and three-exhibition rooms infrastructure maintains the originality of the material used, ensuring better quality of the structure.
The Iron Palace is a historic building believed to be the work of Gustave Eiffel.
Maria da Piedade de Jesus stated that the intention is to transform the Iron Palace into a space for cultural interaction, as well as serving as a workshop for the discovery of new values of Angolan culture.
Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks.
The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.
Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.
"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up.
They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.'
They called me 'an attention-seeker.'
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.
Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.
"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different.
She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.
"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother.
I want to see them dismissed from the school.
I want to see something done.
Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.
"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement.
We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can.
We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police.
While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her.
She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.
Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86.
He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac.
India mourns the loss of a true global statesman.
A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India.
He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Mickey Arthur Says Remarks About Wasim Akram, Misbah-Ul-Haq Were "Dignified"
The committee decided against renewing Arthur's contract, which paved the way for Misbah to be named the country's chief selector and new head coach.
Arthur said he had supported the participation of both Wasim and Misbah on the committee but was disappointed with the decision after placing his trust in them.
"I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn't follow through," said Arthur during the interview.
"And it just happened to be that Misbah was on the committee that didn't renew our contracts and becomes this heir-apparent," he added.
Arthur refused to speak ill of Misbah in the interview.
Misbah will do a good job, Misbah is a good guy and Pakistan cricket made their decision.
I was disappointed because I loved every second of that job.
The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media, where cricket gossip is widely reported.
Speaking to AFP by phone from Perth, said he had the right to speak his mind after faithfully serving the team for three years.
"I was dignified in my comments because I love Pakistan, the players I worked with, spent time with for three years and respect Misbah and Wasim," Arthur told AFP.
I felt disappointed because I had some unfinished business to do with the Pakistan team and would have loved to continue.
But now we have moved on and I wish Pakistan team the best of luck under Misbah.
Wasim and Misbah both defended their actions following the World Cup.
"I have played for Pakistan and I serve Pakistan cricket in some capacity or the other, so when I was asked to join the committee to decide about the head coach I gave my honest opinion," Wasim told AFP in Karachi.
Misbah added that Arthur was entitled to his opinion.
"I think what he has said is his opinion," said Misbah.
Whatever he has thought he has said.
I always say that everyone has his opinion.
As a member of the cricket committee we gave our honest opinion.
I had good relations with Mickey," he added.
"Good relations are always there and will remain there," the current Pakistan head coach added.
Passenger caught urinating on Sydney train
Disgusting video footage has emerged of a passenger urinating on a Sydney train as horrified school students watch just metres away.
A video of the incident, which occurred at around 8.30am this morning on a train travelling between Werrington and Kingswood, was posted to Facebook by Sydney woman Jordy Lee.
"Share this pig around," she wrote.
Doing this in front of kids on their way to school this morning.
The footage shows a male passenger, believed to be in his late teens, leaning against a pole near the carriage doors and urinating onto the ground.
The footage was filmed by two students as a way of exposing the man's vile behaviour, according to the Penrith Press.
The kids' mum then posted it to Facebook, telling the publication she was left in disgust by the whole incident.
"I am in total shock that this happened in peak hour on a Friday morning in front of children just going to school," she said.
It's an absolutely disgusting thing to do; my dog wouldn't even do that.
Her children told her the man was laying on the seats asleep when they got on, then during the trip he got up and started urinating on the ground.
When he was done he reportedly sat back on a seat and fell asleep again.
Facebook users flocked to the post to call out the passenger for his disgusting behaviour.
"What an animal!" one person said.
That is properly disgusting.
Mate take a leak before you leave the house," another wrote.
A Sydney Trains spokesperson told news.com.au that passengers should report this type of behaviour immediately.
"Sydney Trains encourages customers to remain courteous to others while travelling on our network," they said.
Incidents such as this are rare, however we encourage customers who witness behaviour like this to report it to Train Guards or station staff immediately.
The spokesperson said Transport Officers travel across the network and have the power to issue penalty notices and cautions for ticketing as well as "minor behavioural offences."
They added: "We also work closely with the NSW Police Transport Command, which is responsible for crime prevention across the rail network."
Only police have the powers, training and resources to effectively respond to crime.
Offensive behaviour can be subject to a fine between $400 and $1100.
Carty is most consistent Irish out-half in 2019
Stephen Ferris says Jack Carty's selection against Japan is a reward for his consistency of performance over the past year with both Connacht and Ireland.
The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February, as a late replacement in Ireland's rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations.
He has appeared eight times since then, impressing on each occasion, including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland's demolition of Scotland on Sunday.
Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday, the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month.
A few years back, there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton, and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role.
Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast, Ferris argues that Carty has been the most "consistent" out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton.
I thought he was absolutely superb (against Scotland).
He recognised the Scottish defence and what he was up against.
He played heads up rugby at times.
His kicking game was pretty solid, he looked half decent in defence when he was called upon.
I would say Carty has been probably the most consistent out-half within the Irish system for the last year or so.
He's been superb.
Week in, week out, he's never really let his side down.
The likes of Sexton...
Johnny has had a couple of bad games over the last year or so.
He's been out injured.
He's been a little bit more inconsistent.
Whereas Carty has been really, really steady.
Against a Japanese team that are going to come out firing, they're going to bring huge support, maybe it is that steady hand that you need.
Maybe it is that game management.
I feel that he won't let Joe down.
I'm really excited to see him go out there, starting a game and seeing how he manages the whole situation.
It is such a big game.
Japan are our biggest threat I feel in the rest of the group.
But in saying that, I can't see a Japan team beating us the way the confidence and momentum is with the Irish team at the minute.
One hundred dolphins die on African beach
More than 100 dolphins have mysteriously died on a beach in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa.
Local media report that around 200 melon-headed dolphins were found on a beach on Boa Vista island on Tuesday.
Officials, residents and tourists managed to drag some of them back out to sea, but many returned.
Bulldozers buried 136 dead dolphins.
BIOS Cape Verde, a volunteer environmental association in the former Portuguese colony, said on its Facebook page on Friday it took samples from 50 dolphins and four others were placed in deep freeze by the local council.
The group said veterinarians from the University of Las Palmas in Spain's Canary Islands are due in the coming days to perform tests.
Paralympian to be first blind Dancing on Ice contestant
Scottish Paralympian Libby Clegg has been announced as a contestant on the next series of Dancing On Ice.
The sprinter, who won a gold medal for Scotland at Glasgow 2014 and two for the UK at Rio 2016, will be the show's first registered blind competitor.
The 29-year-old athlete, who gave birth to her son Edward five-months ago, has a deteriorating eye condition called Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy, which gives her only slight peripheral vision in her left eye.
She said appearing on the hit show was an opportunity that she couldn't pass up: "After Rio I achieved my ultimate goal and then I thought 'what else can I do?'
This opportunity came about and I couldn't pass it up.
I love challenging myself and experiencing new things."
The Paralympic champion will be joined by a host of celebrities including veteran comedian and TV host Michael Barrymore, Love Island star Maura Higgins and former Republic of Ireland international footballer Kevin Kilbane.
Clegg won't be the only Scot taking part this year with Glasgow-born actor John Barrowman joining the judging panel.
Each week twelve celebrities will skate live with their professional partners in a bid to impress both the panel and the viewers, who will ultimately decide who wins the show.
Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby will return to present the show which returns to STV in 2020.
Father son duo make Australian wheelchair rugby league history
As a father you really couldn't ask for anything better.
To get the chance to show what we can do together - here in Sydney - words can't describe it, really.
Cannane called for curious fans to attend the two Test series against England next month.
In his eyes, once you get a glimpse of wheelchair rugby league, you'll be hooked.
"It's a game that doesn't discriminate," Cannane said.
You can be able bodied and play and that attracts some great people to our game.
I play wheelchair basketball with Cory on Wednesday nights socially but he can't play in tournaments.
Cory and Craig Cannane will represent their country alongside one another.
To be able to represent our country alongside each other is really special.
Wheelchair rugby league was only introduced to Australia in 2009.
It is played across two basketball courts and features five players per team.
At least three disabled players must be on the court at all times.
A tackle is called when a player takes the tag of an opponent.
The Wheelaroos will first face England at The Whitlam Centre in Liverpool on October 21 before taking them on at the University of Wollongong two days later.
Senegal helicopter crashes in C. African Republic, killing 3
Three Senegalese soldiers died after their helicopter crashed in Central African Republic on Friday, Senegal's armed forces said.
The air force helicopter was returning from an operational mission with the United Nations peacekeeping force when it crashed in the town of Bouar.
Another person was badly wounded.
The U.N. mission said it appeared that poor atmospheric conditions had made a proper landing impossible.
The Senegalese were in contact with the U.N. to evacuate the wounded soldier and repatriate the bodies.
The helicopter is part of a Senegalese fleet working in Central African Republic, where large-scale violence began in 2013.
Armed groups currently control most of the country and carry out deadly attacks on displaced people's camps and other communities despite a peace agreement.
Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings.
The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea.
There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, let's examine the more pessimistic side.
De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break.
It was a violent and unpredictable attack.
He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication.
His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."
Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense.
But is this reason enough to remain afraid?
Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?
As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned?
I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear.
Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders.
But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized.
This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.
That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur.
In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence.
In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.
I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently.
A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well.
Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation.
It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals.
He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?
Banks facing 'enormous' challenges - Commerzbank boss
The challenges facing banks are "enormous," Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke said today, after the German lender said it no longer expected a rise in underlying revenues this year.
The bank's downgrade was announced late last night.
It came as the bank's supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank.
Commerzbank, part owned by the German government after a bailout, has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts, high costs and fines, and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts.
Negative interest rates, increasing regulation, a weaker economy and tough competition.
The challenges facing banks are enormous," Zielke said.
Outgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank "will not make our lives easier," and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate.
Some investors said the bank's overhaul did not go far enough.
Commerzbank, which was ejected from Germany's blue-chip DAX index last year, has already been reducing staff and trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.
It embarked on merger talks with Deutsche Bank earlier this year, hoping to make more savings, but the discussions fell apart.
The bank CEO said the overhaul would allow Commerzbank to stand on its own, but left the door open to future deals, saying the lender should be an "active player" in banking consolidation.
Over the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further.
This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business," the bank said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations.
The tough market backdrop comes amid management change at the bank.
It said that board member Bettina Orlopp would succeed Engels as chief financial officer, while Sabine Schmittroth would become board member for human resources.
The supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank's Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.
The German lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week.
The measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.
Among the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in "strategic areas," so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce.
The mBank sale will further reduce staff levels.
Headcount will fall to 29,300, a spokesman said.
The company now employs about 40,700 people.
Commerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of €1.6 billion, with €750m going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.
The restructuring plan is negative for the German lender's credit rating, ratings agency Moody's has said.
The agency said plans to sell mBank would "further limit the bank's growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group's revenue and profits, and its growth."
Alva Academy serving up World's Biggest Coffee Morning
Clackmannanshire: Alva Academy has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan.
Macmillan Cancer Support's top fundraising school in the UK is celebrating the charity's 'World's Biggest Coffee Morning'.
Pupils and staff at Alva Academy will welcome the Clackmannanshire community to the school for a day for fun, games, tea, coffee and cake.
Dozens of fundraising coffee mornings are taking place across Scotland on Friday.
Alva - located at the foot of the Ochil Hills within Scotland's smallest council area - has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan since 2004.
Over the years staff and pupils have organised events such as bake sales, bingo teas, sponsored silences and ceilidhs to raise money.
Last year, more than 1000 miles were walked, 1000 miles cycled and 101,450ft climbed - earning the school the prestigious Douglas Macmillan Award.
This year, pupils have already taken part in the likes of skiathons, swimathons, hill walks, dog walks and bungee jumps.
Their epic fundraising will come to a close following the coffee morning.
Teacher David Clifford, who previously accepted a UK Government Point of Light award at 10 Downing Street on behalf of the school, said: "Everything has gone swimmingly this year."
We have had a record number of sponsored events including a mass skiathon, swimathon, Ben Nevis walk, bungee jumps, dog walk, days of dance, football and a readathon.
We have taken musicians to four different care homes to entertain and held a bingo tea.
We have had our annual ceilidh - raising over £1000, bake sales, duck races and much, much more.
Top team: The epic fundraising is led by the charity committee comprising of David Clifford, Kirsty Clifford and Shiona Finn.
Mr Clifford - who has written a song to soundtrack a Macmillan video which will follow the school's thank you assembly - said there is never any pressure to beat a previous total.
Instead, the school believes the most valuable thing the youths can give is their time.
He stated: "Yes, it will be nice to raise a huge sum of money - but the money is simply a wonderful by-product of what we do and why."
Just seeing our pupils embracing our values of respect, determination and service is enough for us.
At Wells Fargo, a Jamie Dimon protege finally takes over a big US bank
Three decades before Charlie Scharf was named CEO of Wells Fargo, he got his start by mailing his resume to an up-and-coming banker named Jamie Dimon.
Scharf was a senior at Johns Hopkins University when Dimon hired him at Baltimore lender Commercial Credit.
That move proved pivotal for Scharf: He quickly became Dimon's right hand man and followed him for the next 25 years in a series of roles at institutions that reshaped the U.S. banking landscape.
"I was younger than almost everybody else by 20 years," Scharf, 54, told the alumni magazine of NYU Stern's business school.
That helped me mature in business faster.
Now, Scharf becomes the first of Dimon's proteges to take over a direct competitor to J.P. Morgan Chase, the U.S. financial services giant and the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization.
J.P. Morgan has been called a training school for CEOs as Dimon's deputies have gone on to lead vendors including First Data or European banks such as Barclays or Standard Chartered.
Scharf himself was part of that trend, leaving J.P. Morgan in 2012 to become CEO of credit-card network Visa.
He reportedly tired of commuting from New York to San Francisco for that job, and became CEO of custodian firm Bank of New York Mellon in 2017.
Investors cheered the news that Wells Fargo's six-month search had concluded: Wells Fargo shares climbed 4% Friday.
Scharf now has the biggest challenge of his career: As head of Wells Fargo starting next month, he will be tasked with restoring credibility with customers, employees and regulators after the bank's fake accounts scandal claimed his predecessor, Tim Sloan, and Sloan's predecessor, John Stumpf.
During his tenure, Sloan had replaced managers, revamped sales practices and launched an apologetic ad campaign, but he was blamed for moving too slowly as other abuses came to light.
Wells Fargo became hobbled under a rare Federal Reserve restriction that capped its asset growth, and critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters piled on.
"Just to reiterate the obvious: We know we have a series of regulatory issues that we need to complete the work on," Scharf said Friday during a conference call.
That is really the first priority, and we're going to make sure we don't miss a beat on that.
He gave few other clues as to his approach but added that, like when he joined Visa and Bank of New York Mellon, he was eager to meet his organization.
"In my experience, good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions," he said in the NYU Stern profile.
Ultimately, Scharf may decide to appoint his own direct reports in key roles like chief financial officer, as is typical when a new CEO is named.
To add to his challenges, Scharf, a low-key executive who enjoys woodworking in his spare time, will be going head to head with Dimon and Bank of America's Brian Moynihan as the U.S. megabanks tussle over deposits amid the larger push to digitize financial services and fend off technology giants.
Dimon, the mentor turned rival, seemed pleased that his former protege had made it to the big leagues.
"Charlie is an excellent choice," Dimon said in a statement.
He has great experience, and high character.
He is a first class leader.
David Attenborough to narrate 'Life in Colour' for BBC, Netflix
The BBC and Netflix are teaming up for the first time to co-produce Life in Colour, a new three-part series.
The BBC said in a press release Thursday that Life in Color explores the vital role color plays in animal interactions.
Filmmakers will use new cameras built specifically for the show to unveil a world of color normally invisible to human eyes.
Any series authored by Sir David is very special and this promises to be exceptional.
I am looking forward to seeing the combination of innovative photography and rich analysis to explore the role color plays in animals' lives," BBC Two controller Patrick Holland said.
Life in Color promises to be a unique and original insight into the natural world.
Deploying innovative new technology to reveal our world in new ways, I'm thrilled that we are working with Sir David on a series which promises spectacle and insight," BBC head of natural history and specialist factual commissioning Tom McDonald added.
Filming will take place across the globe, with particular emphasis on Australia.
The series will debut on BBC Two and Netflix in early 2021.
Attenborough, 93, has narrated several BBC series, including the Life documentaries and Planet Earth, and the Netflix series Our Planet.
He will also narrate Extinction: The Facts, a new BBC One special about extinction and its effect on our world.
'Keep doctors working until they're 70': Struggling Italian hospitals tell government
Regional health authorities are calling on Italy's government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they're 70, as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners.
Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country's physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions.
The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy's Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a "regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel."
Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they've turned 65 or having worked for 40 years.
Struggling regional governments are calling for those "who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working" to do so.
Italy's ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant.
By 2025, 38,000 doctors will have retired (45,000 if you include general practitioners), causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists.
The regional health councils' proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven't chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs.
Closely tied to this is the idea of regions offering specialist training scholarships which include a fixed contract at the end to young doctors, as well as forging a closer working relationship between local health authorities and universities, all as a means of speeding up the recruitment process in Italy's struggling health sector.
Regions such as Veneto have in fact already tried to take matters into their own hands by headhunting retired physicians.
Molise in the south has called on army doctors to help out and Tuscany has started recruiting younger doctors.
Renewed bid to find 65-year-old who disappeared two years ago
Police have issued a renewed appeal in their search for missing man Tony Parsons (65), from Tillcoultry, who was last seen two years ago this weekend.
Mr Parsons travelled to Fort William by train from his home on Friday, September 29, 2017.
He cycled south along the A82 and was last seen at 11.30pm that night outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, from where he apparently continued south towards Tyndrum.
Extensive searches of the area were later carried out, involving mountain rescue, air support, dog teams and civilian volunteers - all to no avail.
Chief Inspector Drew Sinclair, Clackmannanshire area commander, said: "Our thoughts very much remain with Tony's family, who have had to endure two years of not knowing where he is or what may have happened to him.
We are determined to provide them with answers and we want to ensure people remain aware that he is missing in case they may have information which could help.
Neither Tony nor his bicycle have been seen since leaving Bridge of Orchy two years ago.
I would urge anyone who believes they may have information or perhaps may have seen a bicycle or cycling equipment which looked out of place to come forward.
Please do not keep anything to yourself if you feel it is small or insignificant.
Allow us to make that judgement.
I would like to thank everyone who has assisted our enquiries so far."
Tony is 5ft 9ins and stocky with short greying hair and a moustache, and wore glasses.
He has a tattoo of an anchor on his upper right arm and a tattoo of an eagle on his left.
He was last seen wearing a red waterproof jacket, a blue long-sleeved cycling top, a high-vis vest, fingerless gloves, with beige combat trousers and walking boots.
Tony was also wearing a silver and grey cycling helmet, and was carrying a silver and blue rucksack.
His bike is yellow-framed with black handlebars.
Anyone with information can to contact Police Scotland via 101, quoting reference 559 of 2 October 2017.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.
U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.
He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all.
Father Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught - CBS Los Angeles
LONG BEACH (CBSLA) - It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.
"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic.
He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.
"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.
Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him.
Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car.
One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford.
The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran.
The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.
"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.
This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.
"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said.
"Did you go back and try to help him or what?"
Nobody said nothing.
Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team.
Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.
"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said.
As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to.
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.
"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.
Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.
Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.
Google bans 46 Android apps made by Chinese firm with 50 MILLION downloads - and it won't say why
GOOGLE has removed at least 46 Android apps used by millions from its Play store and reportedly won't say why.
All the apps belong to Chinese developer iHandy and will still be on your phone if you've already downloaded them.
Sweet Camera is just one of the many apps that has been removed despite being downloaded more than 50 million times.
According to Buzzfeed, Google removed the apps from the Play store last week but won't comment on why it has taken action against iHandy despite Buzzfeed asking several times.
This is the third time in recent months that Google has removed lots of apps from a major Chinese developer.
Buzzfeed has raised concerns about whether Android users can trust the ad and privacy practices of Chinese developers if Google is taking such drastic actions.
iHandy describes itself as "one of the world's largest mobile application developers" and claims to have 180 million active monthly users in over 200 countries.
iHandy created a popular range of emoji apps that have also been removed from the Google Play Store.
The apps that google has removed include selfie, security, antivirus, keyboard, horoscope, emoji and health apps.
In total these apps have been downloaded tens of millions of times.
One of the most popular apps is called Sweet Camera - Selfie Beauty Camera, Filters and its been downloaded more than 50 million times.
Why Google has removed almost all of iHandy's apps from its online store and ad network remains unclear.
Buzzfeed says that a Google representative would only confirm that an investigation of iHandy is ongoing and nothing further.
iHandy has said that Google's move was unexpected and it is still trying to work out the reason behind the removals.
We have reached out to Google and iHandy for further comment.
'Clickfraud ' software pretends to be a normal app on the Google Play Store, but secretly performs criminal actions out of sight
Arrest Warrant Against Rabi Pirzada For Allegedly Keeping Animals Illegally
A local court on Friday issued an arrest warrant against Pakistani singer Rabi Pirzada over illegal captivity of wild animals.
As per a report by The News International, The Model Town Court judge reprimanded the singer for disobeying the court's summon.
Earlier this month, Punjab Wildlife Protection and Parks Department initiated an action against the singer for illegally keeping four pythons, reptiles and an alligator as pets.
The action was taken against the singer after a video, where Rabi Pirzada was seen threatening Prime Minister Narendra Modi with snakes, went viral on social media.
In the video, Pirzada was seen posing with several snakes and an alligator.
Sudan: War Crimes Victims Accuse French Bank of Complicity in Regime Abuses
Sudanese victims of war crimes Thursday filed a criminal complaint against French bank BNP Paribas for alleged complicity in human rights abuses committed by Sudan's regime.
BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan.
In 2015, a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan, but also Iran and Cuba.
This case is different: Rights activists say it's the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity, genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008.
It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period, by allowing it access to financial markets.
"These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds," said Cynthia Tai, executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice, one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case.
"They occur because people can buy weapons, they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations," she added.
The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Bashir on war crimes and genocide charges in Sudan's Darfur region but has been unable to prosecute him in The Hague.
The ousted leader is on trial in his home country on corruption charges.
"We can take them to court, and I think that will be a first step," said Abdalhaleim Hassan, one of the Sudanese filing the complaint.
He says the government-backed Janjaweed militia attacked his village in Darfur numerous times, killing people including relatives.
Later, as a student rights activist, he says he was imprisoned and tortured.
He now lives in the United States.
My journey to the justice will be long.
Not only the bank, but to bring the real criminals to the court," he said.
BNP could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.
But a spokesperson told the AFP news agency that it was not aware a criminal probe had been opened and did not comment on judicial processes.
This is not the first effort to hold French businesses responsible for rights abuses committed overseas.
Authorities here are looking into whether Lafarge cement manufacturer paid the Islamic State group to keep its factories running in areas it controlled in Syria.
Anjali Sualy is a lawyer for the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, which is also supporting the Sudanese victims.
"We hope that by taking the step that we have today, we've put these companies on notice that they need to be aware that these types of business deals are risky," Sualy said.
French investigating magistrates must now determine whether the Sudanese complaint is admissible and whether to open an investigation.
Uber overhauls app in quest to build 'operating system for everyday life'
Uber has announced a slew of updates to its app - including consolidating its food delivery and ride-hailing services, and a new feature highlighting local public transportation options - in a bid to create "an operating system for everyday life."
Uber announced the more than 25 changes to its platform at a launch event in San Francisco on Thursday.
Among the tech company's most significant moves will be merging its ride-hailing app and food-delivery app Uber Eats, and offering users alternative travel information including bikes, scooters, public transportation, and even helicopters in some locations.
"We recognize that becoming an integral part of people's lives comes with real responsibility," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.
That's why we are working to make sure every customer is treated like a VIP, every driver and courier feels like a valued partner, and every city feels like we're a good citizen.
When riders search for a destination, they will see travel options listed in order of price, including public transit as well as electric bikes and scooters.
This means cheaper options such as subway and bus schedules may appear at the top of the list, and riders can request notifications when trains or buses they track are delayed.
The new transit feature is live in Denver and London and will soon be operational in San Francisco, Mexico City, and Paris.
It might seem unexpected for Uber to be guiding users away from taking a car, but the company has long harbored ambitions to become an all-encompassing transit platform.
"To some extent, we're competing against ourselves," Khosrowshahi told the Verge of adding public transit options.
But we have the philosophy that if there's a better product out there for the user, and we think an integrated movement solution is better for the user, we should be the ones competing against ourselves versus others doing it.
Uber Eats will also open more "digital-only restaurants" - businesses with no brick-and-mortar outlet where customers can only order food from on the app.
One digital restaurant comes through a partnership with the celebrity chef Rachael Ray and will be available in 10 cities for 10 weeks exclusively on Uber Eats.
Uber's big changes come as the company struggles to turn a profit months after it went public in May.
In August, Uber cut 400 jobs as it attempted to rein in excessive spending and losses.
In August the company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss: $5bn in three months.
Meanwhile, new regulatory hurdles threaten to raise the company's operating costs by changing how drivers are paid.
In the two-hour event, Uber did not mention Assembly Bill 5, a new law passed in September that will upend the way gig economy workers in California, including drivers, are remunerated, as well as the benefits they are entitled to.
Uber, its competitor Lyft, and other gig economy startups have announced a plan to fight the bill with a 2020 ballot measure.
In addition to platform integrations and Uber Eats changes, Uber made a number of safety updates to the app.
Riders will now use a four-digit PIN to verify they are entering the correct car.
Uber said it is developing an "ultrasound wave" technology so in the future the app can automatically verify riders are in the right car without a PIN number.
In the app, riders will now have a "Report Safety Incident" option and the ability to text 911 in case of emergency.
The company updated its "real-time ID check" feature introduced in 2016, requiring drivers to take selfies to verify identities.
The changes come after Uber was sued for $10m in April by a woman who was sexually assaulted by her driver.
A number of women announced last week they were bringing lawsuits against Lyft over drivers sexually assaulting them.
The victim in the case against Uber alleges that the company failed to "warn her of the risk its services posed to women."
A CNN report last year found at least 103 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers over a period of four years.
Uber also announced an expansion of its Uber Rewards program, which allows customers to redeem points when taking an Uber ride, ordering Uber Eats, or spending with partner restaurants.
Cardiff council backs plan to give new streets Welsh names
Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital.
Cardiff council's cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language.
The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded.
However, existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names.
Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language, but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years.
There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh.
The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name "consistent with the local heritage and history of the area."
It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link.
More than 60% of people who took part in a consultation agreed with the proposal to work towards parity between Welsh street names and English ones, with the majority feeling the policy would have a positive effect on the Welsh language.
The Welsh Language Commissioner, Aled Roberts, said: "I congratulate Cardiff council on their new street naming policy."
Place names can say a lot about an area's history and heritage; and this policy in the capital shows the council, and indeed, the country's commitment to promote the Welsh language.
Mabli Siriol from the Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith said: "We welcome the council's intention to name every new street in Welsh only."
It would give a boost to the status and use of the language in the city.
After all, the Welsh language belongs to everyone in Cardiff.
Caro Wild, the cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: "Ensuring that the names of new streets in the city reflect local heritage and the Welsh language will assist our vision of developing Cardiff as a truly bilingual capital city.
Adopting this policy will also see us joining other enlightened capitals around the world, like Wellington in New Zealand, who are embracing their own heritage by promoting the Māori language until it has parity with English.
It's very encouraging that the majority of people who took part in the consultation are in favour of these proposals."
The Welsh language is intrinsically linked with the history of Cardiff over the centuries.
By working towards parity between Welsh and English street names as the city continues to grow, we will ensure that Welsh history, culture and language remains an important part of the city's identity.

Kenya: At Shamata Stadium, "Keeper Can't Dive Due to Construction"
Shamata is the highest settlement area, in terms of altitude, in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners, but only if sports infrastructure is developed.
At about 2,800 metres above sea level, the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up.
Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera, the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final, a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.
She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83.
Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency, whose MP, Jeremiah Kioni, once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County.
Residents of Ndaragwa, being in the extreme north of Nyandarua, seek most services either in Nyahururu town (Laikipia County) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive.
Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium.
The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes.
One of these fields is at Shamata township.
Shamata Ward MCA, Reuben Gitau says the land "will be developed into ultramodern sports facility."
"The stadium will have two pitches, track, handball, volleyball court and a place for indoor games," the MCA said.
A Sh4 million dais that is being constructed by the county government has encroached too much onto the existing football pitch.
Part of the dais has interfered with goal area thus becoming dangerous to players since the field is still being used.
The MCA explains that the whole stadium will be redesigned to change the current pitch from its present north-south direction to the unconventional east-west one.
Gitau could not immediately give the exact acreage of the fenced stadium ground but insisted it will accommodate a running track, two pitches and ball courts and indoor games facility.
Officials in the county headquarters could not say if a design for the stadium existed or if money for its development has been budgeted for.
Youth, Sports and the Arts executive, Murani Ngugi put the acreage of the fenced area at about five acres.
If the facility will have two pitches, then it will be the second in the region after the legendary Nyahururu Stadium.
Reports that Shamata will have a modern stadium has been received well by local youth who have been yearning for a place to develop their sporting talents.
The captain of Shamata FC, James Ndiritu, speaking after his team beat Leshau Pondo FC 4-0 in the final of Ndaragwa Constituency inter-wards tournament, said the youth are eagerly waiting completion of the stadium, hoping it's not hot air.
He said youth in the area have been lacking a place to engage in sports.
But it remains to see if the politician's statement will be supplemented by action.
In search of glory, Yemen athlete drowns in Med trying to reach Europe
Slim and with a tight-trimmed beard, Yemeni Kung Fu champion Hilal al-Haj dreamed of finding athletic glory in Europe, but a risky sea journey to get there ended in tragedy.
The 25-year-old athlete drowned in the Mediterranean after being swept away as he attempted to swim from Morocco to the Spanish enclave of Melilla last week.
His family in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa was expected on Friday to bury the 2011 Yemen Kung Fu champion, who had also racked up a series of medals from Asian and Arab championships.
"He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete," his older brother Saeed said.
"He loved life, he detested war," he told AFP by phone.
Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco, where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave.
The athlete was proud of his heritage, his brother said, but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges.
Yemen was rife with "contempt" and "injustice," Saeed said, adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen's conflict.
After returning to Sanaa from a championship in Azerbaijan, where Haj won third place representing Yemen, he expected to be celebrated by rebels.
The answer was painful.
"They told him that no one had asked of him to raise the flag of Yemen," Saeed said.
Years of war have made leaving and entering Yemen nearly impossible, but Haj faced even greater difficulties when attempting to cross over the heavily fortified land barrier surrounding Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco.
After two months of failed attempts, he decided to swim for it, his brother said.
"It was a short distance.
People before him have tried and succeeded," he told AFP.
My brother was athletic, it seemed like it would be easy, but tragedy struck and he was swept away by a powerful wave.
A friend accompanying Haj on the swim who managed to make it safely to the Spanish enclave said the journey was "extremely difficult."
"The waves were so high," the friend, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.
When (Haj) screamed, I thought it was because he was tired.
I didn't know he was drowning.
Haj's body was recovered and flown into Yemen's southern city of Aden on Thursday.
It was expected to be carried on to the capital in an ambulance, Saeed said.
Sanaa airport has been under blockade since 2017 by a Saudi-led military coalition backing the government against the Iran-aligned Huthis.
Haj's father and younger brother are expected to arrive from Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral.
"He always said that we can't reach our sports goals by staying in Yemen," Haj's friend Jamal el-Sabri told AFP.
The failure of the sports institutions, corruption and nepotism destroy sports and talent.
The more time passes, life is becoming more difficult and our ambitions are dying.
Financial autonomy, empowering institutes to appoint chairman on agenda
A new model of financial autonomy, an option for academically weak students to exit early and empowering the Board of Governors to appoint the chairperson are matters likely to be discussed at today's IIT Council meeting, sources said.
The meeting of the Council, which is the highest decision-making body of all the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), will be chaired by Human Resources Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'.
The agenda for the meeting also includes a proposal for the IITs to consider providing students an option to exit a course after six semesters rather than dropping out.
According to sources, the Council will consider a proposal to empower the Boards of Governors of IITs to pick their respective members and chairpersons.
Presently, the HRD Ministry appoints them.
"This autonomy is on the lines of what has been granted to the IIMs under the new IIM Act," a source said on Thursday.
A new model of financial autonomy will also be discussed in the meeting today.
The IIT Council comprises of top government functionaries, IIT and regulatory officials.
It also includes three nominated members of Parliament.
The Council coordinates the activities of all IITs.
It is mandated to advise on matters relating to the duration of the courses, degrees and other academic distinctions to be conferred by the institutes, admission standards, and other academic matters.
It is also expected to lay down policies regarding cadres, methods of recruitment, and conditions of service of employees, institution of scholarships, levying of fees, matters of common interest, and to examine the development plans of each institute.
Boris Johnson's tax cuts will cost £26billion a year
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy
Warned giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path"
Treasury spokesman said: "Any decisions would be for the Chancellor to take"
The Prime Minister's proposed tax cuts will cost up to £26billion a year and mainly benefit wealthier households, the UK's leading economic think-tank warns today.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy to lift the thresholds for both higher rate income tax and National Insurance.
It warned the giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path," given the risk of leaving the EU without a deal.
Echoing criticism made by opposition parties, the think-tank also concluded most of the tax cuts would go to those on higher incomes.
The intervention will heap pressure on Mr Johnson to water down the tax-cutting commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign, which he is gambling on to be a big vote winner when a general election is called.
Mr Johnson pledged to raise the threshold for paying higher rate income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from £50,000 to £80,000.
He said he wanted to help the "huge numbers" of middle income households which have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent higher rate of tax.
The number of people paying higher rate tax has more than doubled from 1.6million in 1990 to 3.8million.
In its report, the IFS said the PM's proposed tax cut would cost the Treasury up to £9billion a year if introduced immediately and would take 2.5million people out of paying 40 per cent higher rate tax.
It described it as a "substantial and expensive tax cut from which only those on high incomes would gain."
Mr Johnson has also outlined plans to raise the point at which National Insurance kicks in, currently set at £8,632.
The IFS calculated that every £1,000 rise in the threshold would cost £4billion if they were increased in tandem.
Increasing all the thresholds to £12,500 in line with the personal allowance for income tax would cost £17billion a year, it warned.
The report said only 3 per cent of gains would go to the poorest 20 per cent of households as so many do not earn enough to pay national insurance, or are unemployed.
The IFS stressed the annual bill for Mr Johnson's tax cuts could range between £10billion and £20billion, if the tax cuts are phased in more gradually.
Antonio Brown says he's not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he's not retiring from the NFL, only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a rant.
The four-time All-Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "I'm still the best why stop now."
He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him.
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women.
He was released by the New England Patriots last week after playing only one game.
He's been dumped by three teams in the last six months.
Brown, who lost Nike as a sponsor last week, says he'll practice at high schools one day a week, starting in Miami.
The 31-year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter spat with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle, who faced him often with the Baltimore Ravens.
Twitter Suspends Chinese Accounts Targeting Hong Kong Protests
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and "because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed," the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.
Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations.
The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.
"We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media," a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP.
We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies.
Though Twitter is banned in China, it is available in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region.
The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world.
One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.
An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.
About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network.
Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.
The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.
The Twitter campaign reflects the fact that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully," Lewis said.
So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy.
Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing such data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said.
"We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves," the official said.
As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.
Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future.
In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting log 0065 of September 26, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
EBRR will Allocate 300 Million Euros to support Renewable Energy Projects in Kazakhstan
Renewable energy projects in Kazakhstan have garnered interest from international financial organizations.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will allocate 300 million Euros to support the country which is a regional leader in alternative energy development.
Meanwhile, renewable energy facilities with a capacity of over 900 megawatts have been launched in Kazakhstan.
Based on the results of the first half year, the production capacity was estimated at 700 megawatts.
The favorable investment climate and legislative base contribute to the development of the sector, said experts.
Currently, about 70 to 80 projects have been implemented in Kazakhstan.
Last year, an additional 30 companies have won an auction.
This year, there are many winners of the projects.
"This shows that the number of projects which were built in line with development projects in Kazakhstan will reach 100 units," said CEO of Renewable Energy Association in Kazakhstan, Arman Kashkinbekov.
Sir Bani Yas Church and Monastery: UAE's oldest Christian site opens to the public
Located around 200 kilometers from the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, on the eastern coast of Sir Bani Yas Island, lies the country's oldest Christian site.
Originally discovered in 1992, the archeological treasure has recently opened to the public.
Named Church and Monastery of Sir Bani Yas, the site is believed to date back around 1,400 years.
Its excavation has revealed a complex history of the people who lived there.
"I think it's a misconception that there is no archaeology here," says Peter Magee, an archaeologist at the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism.
There are other sites that remain un-excavated.
The archaeology here goes back 8,000 years.
In the early nineties, the rocky infrastructure was thought to have no religious association.
After further investigation, however, Christian crosses were unearthed, as was the architectural framework of a church and monastery.
The floorplan of the house of prayer revealed dormitories, a kitchen, cells and burial sites.
Decades later, a 2014 excavation team revealed further structures in the west, southwest, and northern area of the site.
Architects also found items which implied that monks living in the monastery kept cattle and made good use of the sea for food.
While other objects suggested they traded with their Muslim neighbours in the Arabian Gulf in the 7th and 8th century.
Today, a decorative frieze, which is believed to have framed the doorway of the holy site, is on display at Abu Dhabi's Louvre Museum.
"At least for 100 years, there was a Christian community here and Christians and Muslims were living very peacefully side by side," says Magee, adding that the monastery is one of the few historic Christian sites in the Gulf.
Other similar plots in the region include Saudi Arabia's Eastern province of Jubail and two churches on Kuwait's Failaka Island.

Algeria: Brother of Deposed President Jailed for 15 Years
The brother of Algeria's deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and three associates have been jailed for 15 years for plotting against the state, following an expedited trial.
Said Bouteflika was considered by many as the true power behind his brother after he suffered a stroke in 2013.
According to local news citing Miloud Brahimi, one of the defence lawyers, six people were convicted overnight in the closed-door trial in Blida.
Two remain abroad, thought to be in Spain.
Those currently in Algeria include Said Bouteflika along with Louisa Hanoune, the chief of the Lawyers for Workers's Party, and two intelligence chiefs, General Mohamed Mediene - who headed the secret service for 25 years - and General Athmane Tartag, a former ex-spy chief.
The remaining two, sentenced in absentia to 20 years, include former businessman Farid Benhamdine and former defence minister Khalid Nezzar.
It's the highest-profile conviction among Algeria's political and business elite since Bouteflika's ouster in April.
All four were convicted of "undermining the authority of the army" and "conspiring against the state," in a verdict delivered away from the media.
One of the lawyers told AP the trial was chaotic, with Bouteflika refusing to answer the judge's questions and walking out.
General Tartag had refused to leave his cell.
The defence counsel have vowed to appeal and express indignation at the speed of the trial and its lack of transparency.
One of Mediene's lawyers said he was "surprised by the severity of the verdict," while another lawyer said the trial was "political" and "an attack on democracy."
Army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah, has used these allegations of a conspiracy plot by the six against him, to push for new elections to be held on 12 December.

Nestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup.
In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate.
Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys.
Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG.
It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said.
"This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business.
Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.
Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018.
Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA.
Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.
Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks.
Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other.
Bayer is contesting the verdict.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals.
However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.
Somalia: At UN, Somalia's President Spotlights Country's Progress, but Cautions Eradicating Terrorism 'Will Not Be Easy'
Somalia is "the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system," President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday, while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation, particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab.
Somalia's progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead, but Mr. Mohamad said "one cannot remain deaf and blind" to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty, inequality and unfair globalization.
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity.
He went on to express his country's pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections.
And while he called Somalia "historic" example of reform, resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction, he cautioned that despite tangible progress, the country still faced many challenges, first and foremost those related to security, on which "everything depends."
"With the help of our international partners, we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism," he said, stressing that the task would not be easy, especially given the "violence, cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab."
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other partners, his country will regain stability, which was in the interest of the region and the world.
Turning to one of the key issues before Member States, climate change, he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent, was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures.
Somalia was also impacted by land degradation, long-term drought and deforestation.
Mr. Mohamed reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement, but also to Security Council resolution 751 (1992), which called on all States to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct and indirect import and export of Somali coal.
"It may not save the environment, but it will definitely deprive terrorists of a source of funding," he said.
J. Lo, Shakira to perform at Super Bowl halftime show
NEW YORK (AP) - Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are going to bring the heat to the 2020 Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show.
NFL, Pepsi and Roc Nation announced Thursday that the superstar performers, who have released music in Spanish and English since the 1990s, will perform on Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Lopez and Shakira both posted a photo of them standing side by side on social media to announce the news.
"Going to see the world on fire," Lopez wrote.
"It doesn't get any bigger than this!
So excited about getting on that #SuperBowlLIV #PepsiHalftime stage!" Shakira wrote.
Both Lopez and Shakira have had major success the pop and Latin charts over the years with multiple hit songs and albums.
Lopez released her multi-hit debut in 1999 and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart with songs like "If You Had My Love," "All I Have" and the remixes of "I'm Real" and "Ain't It Funny."
Lopez recently wrapped up a tour to celebrate her 50th birthday, and her latest movie, "Hustlers," has been a box-office hit and has even earned her Oscar buzz.
Shakira released her first album in 1991 and crossed over with 2001's "Laundry Service," which featured the hits "Whenever, Wherever" and "Underneath Your Clothes."
The singer topped the Hot 100 chart with the Wyclef Jean-assisted anthem "Hips Don't Lie."
Shakira has won 11 Latin Grammys and three Grammys.
"These two remarkable artists are setting a new precedent for what this show can become, and we're confident that this will be an incredible performance for the ages," Todd Kaplan, Pepsi's vice president of marketing, said in a statement.
Jay-Z's Roc Nation company is co-producing the halftime show.
The big game and halftime show will air live on Fox and broadcast in 180 countries.
Japan Airlines seat map to avoid crying babies causes media storm
A feature on Japan Airlines' seat-booking system warning travellers of where young children are seated has caused a storm online.
The facility, offered as part of the airline's "Smile Support" travel service for those with infants, is not new, but still lit up the internet after a Twitter user praised it.
"Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip.
This really ought to be mandatory across the board," venture capitalist Rahat Ahmed tweeted.
A somewhat bemused JAL spokeswoman confirmed the feature, while also pointing out it was not a novel offering.
At least one other Japanese airline does the same: All Nippon Airways (ANA), where a spokeswoman confirmed its seat maps have shown where children are sitting "for a while."
JAL's maps indicate where infants under two are sitting, with a child icon to let "other passengers know."
The revelation caused an internet firestorm, with supporters and naysayers battling it out.
"Answered prayers," airline specialist site The Points Guy titled a post on the subject.
"But how long before we get upcharged for seats away from said babies?" one user asked.
Another called the map an unnecessary offering.
Why not just have noise-cancelling headphones?!
And some pointed out that babies aren't the only troublesome travellers.
"Can we use the same software to avoid people who eat noisily instead?" one Twitter user asked.
"Will airlines also have maps for obnoxious passengers that drink too much, remove their shoes, hog the armrest or recline in my lap?" added another.
Ahmed reported Friday that he had arrived in New York after his JAL flight.
"Ironically chose to sat next to several babies on my two flights: Some great, some loud.
It happens.
Some adults were worse," he tweeted.
New Delhi, Sep 27: The Army and Border Security Force (BSF) has sounded an all-out alert along the entire Indo-Pak border and LoC, asking border guarding troops and observation posts to keep a "hawk's eye" over similar air-intrusions in future.
GPS-fitted drones capable of lifting up to 10 kg of weight flew in from Pakistan seven to eight times to airdrop several cache of arms, ammunition and fake currency, which were seized in Punjab's Tarn Taran district, the ongoing probe by the Punjab police has revealed.
The Army and BSF officials said the troops and observation posts have been asked to maintain the highest possible vigilance along with the International Border and Line of Control (LOC) in Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Rajouri, Poonch and Baramulla, Kupwara districts of the state.
Doval tells security forces to put anti infiltration grid on high alert
It is a new modus operandi of Pakistan to smuggle arms, ammunition and explosives in India for triggering terror.
"We have activated our forces to keep a hawk's eye on movement of drones along the IB," BSF officials said.
BSF troops guarding over 180 kms of IB with Pakistan have strengthened their observation posts and "listening posts" to keep a close watch against any intrusion by drones.
The BSF is also patrolling riverine areas along the IB and has deployed water patrol teams in the Chenab river to foil terrorists' design to infiltrate into India from Pakistan, they said.
They have been told to shoot down any drone intruding into the Indian airspace, officials said.
The Army has also intensified patrolling in mountainous valleys and riverine areas along the LoC in Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch and Rajouri districts to check intrusions of drones from Pakistan and infiltration by terrorists.
The troops along the LoC are on the highest degree of alertness in the wake of Pakistan's plans to stage infiltration and use drones to smuggle weapons, Army officials said.
A top Army commander on Wednesday said Indian armed forces are capable of identifying such devices and any military drone venturing into Indian territory from Pakistan will be "shot down."
Referring to the reports on intrusion by Pakistani drones and their low weight carrying capacity, South Western Command chief Lt Gen Alok Singh Klare said there was "nothing to worry" at the moment.
The Punjab Police on Sunday claimed to have busted a terror module of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), backed by a terror group based in Pakistan and Germany.

Tyrone's Gavin Devlin picks up 24-week suspension
Tyrone selector Gavin Devlin has been hit with a 24-week suspension following his conduct as a supporter at an underage game.
Croke Park's Central Hearings Committee (CHC) upheld the suspension proposed by the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) following incidents during an Under-15 inter-county game between Tyrone and Down on 27 July.
He was accused of 'disruptive conduct not causing the premature termination of a game', by a supporter.
Devlin, who works alongside Tyrone boss Mickey Harte, didn't accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC and chose to request a hearing in front of the CHC, who found the alleged infraction proven.
Devlin now has the option to go to the GAA's Central Appeals Committee in an attempt to have his punishment overturned.
Assuming that the suspension starts from the issuing of the CHC's findings on Thursday, Devlin will be ruled out of all involvement with the Tyrone squad until early March, well into the 2020 Allianz League campaign.
Former Tipperary hurler Eoin Brislane has been suspended for a total of 16 weeks arising from an incident in Tipp's Under-15 Arrabawn Hurling Tournament match with Wexford on 31 August.
The CCCC had proposed two separate bans on the grounds that Brislane had used abusive language towards a referee and for "any type of assault of a referee" under Rule 7.2 (c) of the official guide.
The CHC upheld the first of those, imposing a four-week ban, though found the second alleged infraction unproven.
They found, however, that "the evidence presented did disclose a lesser infraction."
That infraction was "minor physical interference with a referee" and imposed a 12-week suspension.
Like Devlin, Brislane can ask for his case to go before the CAC.
Nigeria: Sowore - Court Threatens Imprisonment of SSS Director
The Federal High Court, Abuja Division, has issued a warning that it would order the imprisonment of the Director-General of the State Security Service (SSS), Yusuf Bichi
The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore.
The court's warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore's lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana.
A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison.
"Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court, Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant, you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison," the document read.
The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent.
Mr Sowore, who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag #RevolutionNow, is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony, fraud and cyberstalking.
The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as "insulting, causing hatred and enmity" to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The charge sheet also included an allegation that Mr Sowore and another defendant, Olawale Bakare, planned the protest to overthrow the incumbent government.
The SSS had obtained two separate orders for Mr Sowore's detention till September 21.
At the expiration of those orders, the SSS informed the court of an application earlier seeking further detention of Mr Sowore for 20 days.
It also notified the court that the recent application had been overtaken by events based on the provisions of the law, since the SSS had filed an information before the court suggesting that investigations had been concluded regarding allegations against Mr Sowore.
Despite that declaration by the SSS lawyer, G. A. Agbadua, the prosecution still hinted the court of its desire to continue detaining Mr Sowore.
Mr Agbadua argued that the allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment and that bail in such circumstances where highly restricted.
That claim was, however, refuted by Mr Sowore's lawyer, Femi Falana, who told the court that Mr Agbadua was misleading the court with his claim that allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment.
Mr Sowore met all the bail conditions on Wednesday, as certified by the court, and the SSS was promptly notified.
However, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES Thursday, a lawyer from Mr Falana's Chambers, Marshal Abubakar, said they were still expecting to hear from the SSS after leaving the office of the security agency on Wednesday night without the detained publisher.
He said the SSS officials explained that they were awaiting a directive for Mr Sowore's release from Mr Bichi.
Why you should buy Herman Miller and Steelcase's stocks
U.S. businesses may be showing some signs of weakness, but that shouldn't scare you away from buying the stock of two office furniture companies, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
Not only are Herman Miller and Steelcase are defying conventional wisdom, but they also have room to continue rising, the "Mad Money" host contended.
Herman Miller, a Zeeland, Michigan-based maker of high-end office furniture, has seen its stock rise 52% for the year, Cramer noted.
It closed at $45.98 on Thursday.
Steelcase, which is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is a leading supplier of products for the office environment, is up 24%, Cramer said.
Its stock was at $18.40 at Thursday's close.
Cramer said there are two main reasons why the companies are having success, despite recession fears and the U.S.-China trade war.
The first is the tight labor market.
Currently, the U.S. jobless rate is 3.7%.
Compared with other business expenditures, "fancy office furniture is tied much more, much more, tightly to the labor market," Cramer explained.
"A tight labor market means workers have more leverage, and when workers have more leverage, they get the nice office chairs with lumbar support," Cramer said, alluding to Herman Miller's Aeron chairs.
The second factor, Cramer said, is better execution and falling commodity prices, which has allowed the furniture makers to be hurt less by tariffs.
Both companies do a lot of sourcing from China, Cramer said.
"In fact, in a perverse way, the tariffs might be helping, because they're contributing to the worldwide slowdown that's driving down commodity prices, giving Herman Miller and Steelcase lower raw costs," Cramer said.
Perhaps the thing Cramer likes most about the two companies?
They are still "absurdly cheap, selling for about 12 times next year's earning estimates," Cramer said.
"In a market that's increasingly wary of high-flying stocks with nosebleed valuations, these two value plays could be just what the doctor ordered," Cramer said.
Last week, both Herman Miller and Steelcase beat earnings expectations.
In addition, Herman Miller reported 7.4% sales growth compared with the same quarter last year, while Steelcase's revenue was up 14% in that same time frame.
That caught Wall Street's attention, but Cramer said he thinks the two companies are still worth buying.
"Even after last week's explosive rallies, I bet they can go higher still," he said.
Harker says Fed should 'hold firm' on interest rates
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has "clear downside risks."
"My own view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out," he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity.
Harker, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed's benchmark interest rate by a quarter, the second reduction this year.
He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed's 2% goal.
Yet he also noted potential problems with "trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed."
Along with his views on rates, Harker also weighed in on last week's tumult in the overnight lending, or repo, market that saw short-term rates spike to 10% and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range.
While the events shook markets, "they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy.
Nor do they have implications for the wider economy," he said.
However, he added that the Fed should continue to look at its approach to where it is holding its balance sheet and said "organic" expansion should be considered.
Gamers get chance to compete at Euros
UEFA has opened registration for esports competitors to represent their national teams at the inaugural eEURO 2020, with the qualifying phase kicking off in November 2019.
Players from all 55 of UEFA's national associations will look to qualify for the final tournament in London from 9-10 July, a couple of days before the final of the main European Championship at Wembley Stadium on 12 July.
Gamers will compete in Konami's eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer 2020 (PES 20) on the Playstation 4 video game console.
Between November 2019 and January 2020, each national association will nominate their team, with participants being chosen through either a domestic online or physical tournament - unless a national eFootball team already exists.
A draw will take place in January 2020.
It will divide the participating nations into 10 groups for the online qualifying phase, to be contested between March and May 2020.
The winner of each group and the best six runners-up will qualify for the final tournament in London.
"eFootball is played by tens of millions of people across the continent and we are delighted to give competitors from our national associations the chance to represent their country on the biggest stage," said UEFA marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein.
We have seen a massive growth in the popularity of eFootball over the past few years and the eEURO 2020 will give us the opportunity to connect with new and existing fans of national-team football.
A total of $100,000 in cash prizes will be split between the quarter-finalists, including $40,000 for the winners.
The champions will also receive tickets to watch the final of EURO 2020.
Lil Wayne ordered to pay over $150K in phony concert case
Lil Wayne is up for about $150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn't even bother to respond to the lawsuit.
According to TMZ, a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it's a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn't show.
The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January, in which the investor claimed they were "Ponzi scheme artists" who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform.
The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows.
Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter.
He said Wayne received the $500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash.
According to the legal docs, Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond, so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy.
Typically, the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond.
This is the latest in a string of legal troubles for the 36-year-old.
Earlier this year he threatened his former record company Moments in Time with legal action because they wouldn't return an old lyric notebook of his, instead they were trying to auction it for £189,600.
He also filed a £15.2 million lawsuit against former attorney Ronald Sweeney for allegedly tricking him out of the same amount while he represented the musician for 13 years.
The issues have ranged from policy disputes to legal challenges around immigration, automobile efficiency and housing.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler's letter to Governor Gavin Newsom said the governor and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles "do not appear to be acting with urgency" to mitigate the public health risks from "untreated human waste entering nearby waters."
Wheeler said the state was "failing to meet its obligation required under delegated federal programs" and that he wanted the state to detail how it will respond.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed accused Trump of "taking swipes" at her city for "no reason other than politics.
"There are no needles washing out to the Bay or Ocean from our sewer system, and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco," she said in a statement.
"I would love to have a President that wants to work with us on solutions to the challenges we face, whether that be with our infrastructure, our need for more housing, or helping people exit homelessness."
Eric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA, said the agency's current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it "has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US."
EIP has found that sources like factory farms and coal ash dumps near power plants are major sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA enforcement.
Earlier this week, Newsom said at a United Nations Climate Summit that he was "humiliated" by Trump's environmental record.
The administration has rolled back numerous environmental protections, from the Endangered Species Act to Obama-era climate rules, that Trump has called obstacles to economic development.
During a fundraising trip last week in California, Trump had threatened to have the federal government step in to "clean up" the homeless problem there and said floated the idea of the EPA going after San Francisco for allowing drainage from homeless encampments into the Pacific ocean.
Last week, Trump revoked California's decades-old authority to set its own emissions standards for automobiles, prompting a lawsuit days later by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the administration over 60 times on various issues.
Zimbabwe: 'Poisoned' Doctor Leaves Country for Treatment
A doctor in Zimbabwe who was abducted and allegedly tortured for leading a doctors strike left the country late Thursday for what his medical team calls "urgent" treatment in South Africa.
Dr. Peter Magombeyi, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, had been receiving care in Harare for a week since his release from captivity.
Friends and colleagues suspect he was poisoned during his five-day abduction and now has liver damage.
His father, Kingstone Magombeyi, had been staying with him at the hospital since his release last Thursday.
"I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners, am very happy on that one, because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication," Kingstone Magombeyi said.
Peter Magombeyi's departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court, George Chiweshe, chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving.
Monica Mutsvangwa, Zimbabwe's Information Minister, maintains police interfered with Magombeyi's departure for safety and health reasons.
"The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public," Mutsvangwa said.
They therefore need the court's assistance in delaying Dr. Magombeyi's departure to South Africa, before him giving the vital leads they need to advance their investigations.
It is the duty of the police to protect the safety of all its citizens.
While Magombeyi has left Zimbabwe for medical treatment, his association says doctors are not calling off their three-week strike.
His colleagues say the outspoken doctor was abducted for calling the strike on Sept. 3 to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to raise doctors' salaries, currently equal to less than $200 per month.
With land out of bounds, Pak terrorists plan to infiltrate through the skies and seas
New Delhi, Sep 27: Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules, training camps just to name a few.
However, over the past couple of weeks, the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.
It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari.
Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up.
The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing.
While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot.
Officials say that as the latest information available, Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes.
The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters, IB officials further note.
Several intelligence reports available with OneIndia state that the naval wing of these groups is handled by the Musa Company, which is the special services group of the Pakistan Army.
The naval wing of these terrorist groups is not often used by terror groups.
It is part of the surprise element, the reports state.
Since 2004, it had become mandatory for every Lashkar-e-Tayiba recruit to undergo a certain amount of maritime training.
This apart, the terrorists also take part in classes on elementary flying.
As part of the training programme, the first class is held in Thakot and then at Murdike.
The training programme comes to a close at Karachi and each of these sessions is conducted by officers of the Musa company.
In the days to come the sea route would be the most preferred for terrorists.
It is impossible to man the entire sea and hence in this regard, intelligence and coordination become the key.
In addition to this, there is also a dire need to introduce hi-tech technology to aid the Intelligence Bureau.
The reason why Intelligence, technology and coordination becomes crucial is that 90 per cent of the world trade is sea-based and it is impossible to man each and every vessel on the sea.
The smaller ones, in particular, pose the maximum danger.
